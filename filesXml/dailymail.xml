	a British entrepreneur has taken the idea and turned it into reality, creating a powdered foodstuff billed as ‘nutritionally complete’, made from oat flour, pea and rice protein, flaxseed and various vitamins.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

And Hearn and Neo are not its only fans  as Dr Frankie Phillips of the British Dietetic Association gave it a qualified thumbs-up.
It provides all the vitamins, minerals and nutrition the body needs, and enough fluid as well. It does what it says on the tin, she said. Although, if someone was eating this for years, its questionable what might happen to their physiology.
So, can Man really live on powdered food alone and get his recommended 2,500 calories a day? To find out, I attempted to consume nothing but the product for a day and believe me it was 24 hours of Huel.
Grim grub: Neo wakes up to the real world in The Matrix and discovers all there is to eat is a nutritious gloop
THEY CALL IT THE 'HUEL' BUT DRINK LOOKS LIKE KEANU'S 'GLOOP' TO US
All that Keanu Reeves as Neo and PVC-clad fellow rebel Trinity have to eat in The Matrix, the 1999 film about humanity enslaved by a machine, is a gruel-like gloop. Its a single-cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals. Everything the body needs, explains Neos pal  and thats the slogan printed on Huels packaging. Sure enough, Neo battles through a trilogy of Matrix movies, so maybe there is something in the Huel fuel diet after all
BREAKFAST
My first meal of the day normally consists of fruit salad (for vitamins), yoghurt (calcium), cereal (fibre), eggs (amino acids) and toast (carbohydrates). Sometimes theres a frankfurter or two (protein, fat), and hot chocolate (sugar!) too.
My wife Rocio and I insist our two children know the value of a varied breakfast and leave for school with a full tank. So I get a quizzical look when I open the anti-moisture, zip-lock, foil-wrapped Huel pack, and am asked: Is this is a good idea?
It is a perfectly balanced blend of all the macro and micro nutrients that your body needs to function effectively, I parrot. Its got everything in that your breakfasts got.
I peer into the packet and take a sniff of my next three meals.
Slim physique:Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the 1999 movie
Huel is flavoured with a hint of vanilla but has the aroma of no other foodstuff I have ever encountered. Its not unpleasant, but it is a little odd. I measure out 500ml of water into the Huel jug which has inside it a special plastic grate designed to break up the powder properly when it is mixed. I drink out of the near-inch wide spout. The consistency is that of runny pancake mixture and Im not sure if I am drinking or eating. It is strangely sweet, surprisingly so given theres no added sugar. This isnt so bad, I think.
Then I feel lumps of unmixed goo in my mouth, so I give my Huel another shake. And I shake it some more. And more. The lumps are still there. Its best mixed in a blender, Hearn told me. Very true. Having downed almost a pint of Huel  500 calories  I go to work.
ELEVENSES
On any given day, reaching 11am is reason enough to celebrate with a cup of tea and  more importantly  a chocolate biscuit or four.
Im usually ravenous, but today I dont feel hungry. Nevertheless, I dutifully break out the Huel. But its sips this time, not gulps.
LUNCH
HUEL is, deliberately, not the tastiest meal. Hearn explained that he didnt want to make it too flavoursome for fear of unleashing another addictive food product on to an increasingly obese planet where once you pop, you just cant stop. Theres no danger of that here.
So, knowing people like variety, he gave me several test flavours that I can shake up with my Huel: chocolate, rhubarb and custard, toffee and mocha. He recommended the rhubarb and custard, so I try it.
The pink powder looks and smells reminiscent of something youd find in a 10p sweetshop mix, but the hue of the Huel remains stubbornly beige. It livens up the flavour, but does nothing to improve the consistency. I get through about a cups worth, half my ration.
AFTERNOON SNACK
My enthusiasm is waning. Whats that? asks a colleague. The future of food, I reply, reading off the label again. It looks like nuclear bunker food, he retorts. I cycle home, hunger beginning to hollow.
Shot in the arm:Hearn, pictured, and Neo are not its only fans  as Dr Frankie Phillips of the British Dietetic Association gave it a qualified thumbs-up
Is this the future of dieting? British inventor creates 'human...
DINNER
Theres a jacket potato with tuna mayo and salad if I want it, but I manfully refuse and stick it out on Huel and Huel alone. Well, almost.
Hearn has given me a recipe for Huel cookies: 150g of the powder, a mashed banana, an egg, a teaspoon of butter and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.
By now, I just want to avoid more glugging. I miss texture, crispness, crunchiness, saltiness, tanginess, acidity  anything and everything that makes food truly food.
There might be people who are happy to have the same thing for every meal, but Im not one of them.
I make up the cookie mix, bunging in much more butter than I should and a little sugar for good measure.
Incredibly, they come out of the oven looking edible. Magically, they are edible  and taste like real food. But cleaning up the cake tin afterwards, I cant help thinking making them rather defeats the object of the exercise.
Never mind. I go to sleep, and dream of feasting on fillet steak. Its not real food, but that doesnt matter one bit.

	Tiny Amir was born on Father's Day, but passed away at just 20 weeks. He was placed in a special cold cot at University Hospital of Wales to allow Amy McDonald and Domonic Reshad precious time with him.

The couple were given a special 'teardrop room' at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, designed for grieving new parents.
Miss McDonald, said: 'He was just perfect - I could see him like his dad but he had my turned up nose.
I got to know my beautiful little boy in those few hours. It meant I could kiss and cuddle him, I even got to know his smell. The cold cot has given me precious memories I wouldn't have had otherwise
Amy McDonald, Amir's mother
'The cold cot kept him that way so we could have him for almost a day before we knew we had to say goodbye.
'I don't know who came up with the idea but I'd like to give them a hug.'
Miss McDonald and hairdresser Mr Reshad took more than 300 photographs  of their baby son.
Relatives were allowed to visit and he met his grandparents, aunts and uncles during the 21 hours he was in the cold cot.
Amy had a normal pregnancy until 20 weeks when a scan showed her baby was seriously ill and she was told to prepare to give birth.
She went into labour on Father's Day and six hours later Amir was born.
Amy said: 'He took a few breaths and then died in my arms - it was the worst moment of my life.
'But I gained so much comfort from him being able to spend just that little bit of time with us in the cold cot.
'I can close my eyes and see him, I have images of him laying on the bed next to Domonic, I know how it feels to hold him in my arms.'
Miss McDonald said:'I got to know my beautiful little boy in those few hours. It meant I could kiss and cuddle him, I even got to know his smell. The cold cot has given me precious memories I wouldn't have had otherwise'
At her 20-week scan Miss McDonald was told her unborn son was seriously ill, and was told to prepare to give birth. After their traumatic ordeal, the couple are now raising money to buy more cold cots to help others
The couple discovered that three other mothers gave birth to stillborn babies at the same time but there was only one cold cot to go around.
The pair, of St Mellons, Cardiff, raised 1,500 to buy another in less than a day but the fund is still growing and they hope to give the hospital two of the special cots.
They will have a little plaque on the side saying: 'In memory of Amir Reshad.'
Miss McDonald, who has two sons Taio, five and Kobi, one, said: 'Some good will come out of my little's boy's brief time in the world.
'It is important to us that parents have the opportunity to spend some time with their stillborn babies to help them grieve.
'We received the most amazing care at the hospital - it wasn't just care it was love and I can't do enough to thank them.'
A hospital spokeswoman said: 'The cold cot has become part of the grieving process for parents who lose a baby in this way.
'We are pleased this couple have gained so much comfort from it.'
Miss McDonald and Mr Rashad are now preparing for their baby son's funeral next Thursday.

A second problem we face is that if Italy cannot get other countries to accept large numbers of migrants, then they have a simple way out. All they have to do is issue an EU passport to migrants and then anyone can come to the UK legally under EU rules.
I firmly believe the EU should follow the example of Australia which, in 2008, made it clear that migrants arriving by boats would not make Australia their home.
The boats stopped coming. The drownings stopped too.
This issue is far more serious than the usual debate about pressure on public services. This is now one of security.
Threat: A boy holds a Tunisian flag as he stands near bouquets of flowers laid at the beachside of the Imperiale Marhabada hotel. Farage said it was time to 'defend our borders'
Security: Police officers detain a migrant during a clash between migrants and a truck driver next of the ferry boat port of Calais, as Farage warned people getting into UK illegally represent security threat
Dramatic moment migrant climbs into lorry cabin
I would pay tribute to our security services. We know over 300 jihadis who have fought for Islamic State abroad are already back in the UK. Around two dozen of those have planned attacks since returning, but have been thwarted.
I suspect one of the reasons we havent had another atrocity on British soil is because our security services have done such a good job.
We must ensure our security services are given the tools they need to keep us safe. But the threat comes from beyond our shores too.
Britain must bear some culpability for destabilisation abroad. It was our government who foolishly bombed Libya into oblivion. It was a terrible mistake.
Where do the people start their journeys across the Med from now? Libya, a country with a growing IS element. IS have already said that they intend to flood the continent with 500,000 jihadi fighters. Even if that only amounts to 5,000, it is still an alarming prospect.
The Greeks and Italian authorities have absolutely no means of screening the individuals who arrive via boat for links with terrorism and extremism.
When I make the argument we must get tough on border controls to ensure the safety of British citizens, I am told Im not being compassionate. We must not let our compassion imperil our civilisation.
I believe we are making one of the greatest mistakes in our history.

	Home-grown terror is at the top of David Cameron's agenda by JAMES FORSYTH

One of his closest political allies tells me that Cameron is inclined to be more robust than ever.
I am told that the main message of the speech will be that, It has to be recognised that there is an ideology that underpins these despicable terrorist attacks.
This has to be confronted in all its forms, Cameron will argue. You have to tackle the anti-Western rhetoric that makes people think Islamic State is the future, one of those involved in the discussions with the PM tells me.
Cameron was planning his speech even before the horrific Tunisian beach massacre that killed 15 Britons
The speech will also address the vexed issue of identity: why some Muslims dont feel part of Britain. One senior Number 10 figure says: We need to have a discussion as a country about why schoolgirls head off and join Islamic State.
Cameron will, Im informed, set out the responsibilities that both government agencies and British Muslims have.
In Whitehall, there is particular concern that the beheading in France  apparently carried out by one man  might presage a series of lone-wolf terrorist strikes across Europe. These are almost impossible to stop as they dont involve any co-ordination with outside groups.
Indeed, one senior intelligence source tells me that he is more concerned about bedroom radicalisation  people who have been drawn to IS ideology after watching videos on the internet  than he is about those returning from fighting in Syria.
Why? Because those who have been radicalised at home are clean skins and are not on the spooks radar.
I understand that the security services have disrupted at least four sizable terror plots aimed at London in the past 18 months. They are braced for the inevitable: that an attack  especially upon the capital  is bound to succeed at some point.
After all, the terrorists need to get lucky only once.
At Thames House, the headquarters of MI5, they are particularly concerned about Britons who have joined the ranks of Islamic State in Syria and stayed out there.
Their worry is that as these people are promoted up the IS hierarchy, they will turn their attention to ordering attacks on Britain  the target they know best.
PM'S SECRET LINK TO THE BANANA DJ
Ex-No 10 speechwriter Clare Foges and her new book, The Kitchen Disco about fruit that comes to life
Whats the similarity between David Camerons Bloomberg speech setting out his European strategy and The Kitchen Disco? Theyre both written by the same person.
The childrens book is the first by Camerons former speechwriter Clare Foges. Written while she was working in Number 10, its a poem about what happens when a family goes to bed and the fruit in the bowl come out to party.
Thankfully for Cameron and Foges, her poetry and political prose never got mixed up. At least, there is no record that I can find of a prime ministerial speech featuring a banana who DJs after dark.

Where will the new runway be built, Gatwick or Heathrow? On Wednesday, the Airports Commission, set up in 2012 by the Coalition, will finally make its recommendation.
The Government will respond by saying that it will review the findings and make its own decision by the end of the year.
The signs point to Gatwick as the preferred political choice. Tory MPs opposed to that option regard it as significant that Cameron recently asked one of those whose seat would be hit hardest by a second runway, how strongly he really felt about the issue.
The Airports Commission will make its recommendation on whether Gatwick or Heathrow should get a new runway on Wednesday, while the government will respond and makes its own decision by the end of the year
One close Cameron ally tells me the party leadership wouldnt be so keen on Zac Goldsmith, a fervent opponent of a third runway at Heathrow, running for Mayor of London if they were planning to build it there. Also counting against Heathrow is the fact that, early in his leadership, Cameron campaigned passionately against a third runway.
George Osborne has been seen as Heathrows big backer. But I understand that he is now most concerned about getting another runway built quickly, and that might be easier if it is at Gatwick.

The decision by Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to call a referendum on the latest bailout deal has riled other eurozone states, who say it further confuses an already tortuously complicated situation.
Even those in the UK Government who thought that if Greece defaulted it would stay within the single currency, now think it may well end up leaving the Euro altogether.
Cameron faces a difficult Commons appearance on Monday. Eurosceptic Tories are deeply disappointed by the renegotiation aims he laid out at the European Summit. Hes giving up before hes even started, fumes one. Even those involved in maintaining Tory discipline admit they are expecting a few fireworks.
Cameron, however, is bullish. He believes he has made far more progress than expected. He is now fond of saying: I keep being told I cant do things, and I keep doing them.
But if Greece does end up leaving the euro after Sundays poll, everything changes, and Cameron should start his renegotiation over, because a lot more might be on offer.

	Prora was built by Hitler between 1936 and 1939 to be a 'Baltic Butlins,' but plans halted as attention went on the war effort. Over 57 luxury flats have been sold ahead of the October opening.

Metropole's Manfred Hartwig, said: 'The past is the past. Prora may have been built by the Nazis , but it was never used by them or their soldiers.
'Now the place is so lovely, visitors want to get back to nature and enjoy its beauty.'
The construction was part of a programme introduced by Hitler, called Kraft durch Freude - meaning 'strength through joy'.
As part of this, Hitler arranged for there to be activities such as skiing and cruises - and intended to build a collection of seaside resorts on Rgen.
It was  planned to be the biggest holiday camp in the world, occupying over three miles of beach front, and the aim was to provide a bucket-and-spade resort for 20,000 families from Hitlers master race.
Condos can be bought for between 125,000 and 900,000, for those who want a permanent plot of Prora
57 flats of the transformed apartments have already been snapped up by buyers
Berlin firm Metropole has exclusive rights to the unusual holiday destination and hope to stress that the past is the past

There were eight identical buildings erected, offering entertainment, catered meals and organised fun based around Nazi propaganda, and it even won an award in 1937 for its Bauhaus design.
With the onset of war, the intended holiday haven held an entirely different function.
Nazis used the buildings to house workers and to provide accommodation to refugees.
Over time the giant resort fell into disrepair, and was only saved from demolition by being given landmark status.

The Soviets considered blowing it up, but it was discovered they didn't have enough dynamite for the job, so it became a massive tank-and-artillery base for the People's Army of East Germany and it vanished from all maps.
It is hoped that despite its history, the holiday homes will be sought after, and 57 flats have already been snapped up.
The grand opening is scheduled for October with the first full-time tenants already moving in to the  Colossus of Ruegen.
Estate agent Kathrin Lange, told German press, the buildings are for 'risk-tolerant investors'.

	This is how Princess Eugenie (photoshopped) may have looked for her glamorous and bizarre Disney-themed 25th birthday party at Royal Lodge at Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.

MODEL GUEST
Guests  there were around 200  started to arrive at 6.30pm. Jet-setting model Cara Delevingne, while failing to fully embrace the dress code  by the end of the party her only nod to fancy dress was a pair of mouse ears and a mask  was on particularly exuberant form.
According to a guest, she chatted, danced and mingled with other party-goers and was to be heard 'saying how she wants to be seen as Meryl Streep rather than a model '
News that she is dating a woman  American singer/songwriter St Vincent, whose real name is Annie Clarke  didn't deter prospective male suitors who tried to chat her up.

IT'S A ROYAL DRESS UP...
Contrary to reports, Fergie was not dressed as Jessica Rabbit but came as Dorothy from The Wizard Of Oz.
At 55, Prince Andrew squeezed himself into costume as Prince Charming, while Prince Harry revealed his ignorance of the Disney oeuvre, opting to go as Nintendo character Super Mario instead.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, flame-haired Princess Beatrice chose The Little Mermaid, her favourite Disney character. No one else went as Snow White, because strict instructions had been sent out that the role was reserved for Eugenie.
...PLUS FRIENDS OLD AND NEW
Not all the guests were royal. Former Page Three girl Melinda Messenger, whose boyfriend Warren Smith taught Beatrice to ski, was dressed as a sexy Tinker Bell  and posted a picture on social media of the night.
Also there was Guy Pelly (in furry animal onesie) and his wife, the Texan Holiday Inn heiress Lizzie.
Assorted Bransons, including Holly and sister-in-law Isabella, were also present, as well as James Middleton and Donna Air, who posted a picture of themselves on picture-sharing website Instagram as Alice In Wonderland characters the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts.
George Frost, son of the late Sir David, came as the blue genie from Aladdin, while Chloe Delevingne, sister of Cara, dressed as the Angelina Jolie character Maleficent  as a picture posted on social media by a fellow party-goer proved.

Nor were old friendships forgotten, with chums from Eugenie's school days at St George's Ascot and Marlborough College, plus former students of Newcastle University.
A large contingent of her parents' friends  including Fergie's old flame Paddy McNally  made up the numbers. In Eugenie's eyes, though, the most VIP guest was her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, 29, who runs restaurants and nightclubs.
He now lives in Battersea, South London, and is popular with the Yorks, who, it is said, would love him to propose.
PASSPORT CONTROL
Guests were asked to bring their own passport to prove identity as well as the party invite   mocked up to look like the real thing  to gain admittance.
Exclusive: Guests were asked to bring their passports as well as a special invitation which looked like one (pictured)
FERGIE FOOD
At the last minute, it was decided that it should be a buffet rather than a sit-down dinner. There were salads, pasta, salmon, kedgeree  all with a nod to Fergie's healthy eating craze. There was an 'enormous' chocolate cake for the birthday girl  with 25 candles  and everyone belted out 'Happy Birthday'.
GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT
There was Champagne and wine aplenty, but most of the younger guests 'went for vodka, lime and soda or Jack Daniels and coke', just as they would in Mahiki, or Boujis, or Tonteria  or any of the other trendy London clubs this young royal set like to drink in.
The party was held in seven interlinked circus-style tents, inside which were cocktail bars and a cushion-filled chill-out zone.
EUGENIE AND HER CHEEKY DWARFS
Eugenie arrived with seven dwarfs in costume.
Hired from Cheeky Events, a Chigwell based agency, they charge from 100 each per hour.
The Princess made sure she danced with each of them, while friends who wanted to dance with them had to ask her permission because they were her retinue. Wherever Snow White went, her seven dwarfs dutifully followed.
Expensive: Eugenie arrived with seven dwarfs (pictured) who were hired from Cheeky Events and charge 100 each an hour
RAP VS MOTOWN
Entertainment took the form of a live act and a DJ in a booth.
The music was described as 'middle-of-the-road chart hits and lots of R&amp;B and rap' by one guest. Chart hits eventually gave way to Motown tunes to lure the older guests onto the dance floor  and it worked.
Many younger guests changed into clubbing gear at 1am.
NO SPEECHES
If there were any speeches, they were made in private beforehand and not at the actual party.
OH DEAR, DON'T TELL GRANNY
It was definitely crazy cartoon fun, and not entirely classy.
According to one attendee: 'Some guests threw up outside in the grounds. It became extremely raucous by about 2am, with people literally falling over drunk.
'One couple were caught heavy petting.'
Crazy: With 'some guests threw up outside in the grounds', it is probably a good thing that the Queen (pictured) was not present at the raucous affair
LOVESICK HARRY
Harry seemed smitten by Cressida Bonas, who was, says a guest, 'dressed possibly as Cinderella, in a frayed hem dress  but no broom or anything'.
According to onlookers, he ignored the attentions of other girls who approached him.
Fergie, meanwhile, was accompanied by Manuel Fernandez, the Spanish internet entrepreneur who is her new companion. Andrew  though dressed for love as Prince Charming  seemed quite alone, with no woman on his arm.
STAR NO-SHOWS
Some of Prince Andrew's social set apparently didn't make the cut, perhaps indicating that it was Fergie who was firmly in charge.
'The invitations were all sent out madly late, as in the last couple of weeks,' said one guest.
'Although in theory Ascot week was a good thought because the garden is at its best and so many people are in London anyway, many of those invited were already engaged.'
Those on the guest list who were already pre-booked turned out to be largely famous friends of Fergie's. Joan Collins, Kate Moss, Shirley Bassey, Naomi Campbell and Elton John were all asked but most didn't make it.
Elton forsook the delights of Disney at Windsor to play on tour in Aberdeen.
No show: Among the superstars who could not make the event was Sarah Ferguson's good friend Kate Moss (pictured)
Busy: Supermodel Naomi Campbell (pictured) was also asked to come but had prior engagements
FIREWORK FIZZLE
The party, according to one guest, was not quite what Fergie had first envisaged. 'Talk of fireworks was shelved after it was realised the ones they wanted  the go-on-for-hours, accompanied by music variety  were going to be way too expensive. They decided it was better to have none at all rather than a cheaper, quicker display.'
ON THE BUSES
Many of the guests were coached in from London  but at 2 am Fergie 'sent the coaches away so guests could stay until 5 am'.

Never having to check your available funds came top of the list of wealth indicators, followed by having a swimming pool in your house.
Owning a boat and having a housekeeper also featured high in the list - as did sending your children to private school and having a second property.
Being able to spend more than 500 on one item of clothing is another trait, while flying business class is also considered to make you rich.
The survey also found just six per cent described themselves as rich in terms of wealth, while 60 per cent consider themselves to be rich in non-material ways, such as having healthy children and a close loving family.
Cheers: Drinking champagne is another factor that on the Rich List - of 38 reasons - that make you wealthy
Holidays: Going skiing more than once a year was also said to be a sign that you are affluent, researchers said
Less than half of those asked said they aspired to one day be wealthy, while 56 per cent had no such ambition.
This was despite the 37 per cent of the panel claiming to have at least one friend they consider to be rich and 27 per cent being envious of those who are.
And asked whether they believed money would make them happy, just 17 per cent agreed and over half answered 'possibly'.
The study also found many of us feel more able to warm to someone who has worked hard to earn their money, than someone who was born with a silver spoon in their mouth.
Vix Leyton, for  Quidco which commissioned the research, said: 'It's great to see that the majority of us feel rich in non-material ways proving that the finer things in life aren't always the things you can buy.'
ARE YOU RICH? THE LIST OF 38 REASONS THAT MEAN YOU ARE WEALTHY...

1. Never have to check your 'available funds'
2. Have a swimming pool in your house
3. Own a boat
5. Send your children to private school

	A female teacher 'seducing' a boy isn't just a laugh says RACHEL JOHNSON

	The trial of former headmistress Anne Lakey  made me see how blinkered my attitude that only men pose a sexual threat to children was blinkered, by RACHEL JOHNSON.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
This is because we are also conditioned to see the mature woman as the nurturer. We have something called mother expectation: a child left alone with a woman will be safe, but one left alone with a man might be at risk.
(Even though if you interpret the NCA research another way, 97 per cent of men have not the faintest desire to harm children in any way.) But the notion that a woman alone and of her own accord can abuse a child messes with the myth of male power and the patriarchy, and therefore some feminists  for whom everything is the fault of nasty horrid men  dont like it.
Even known female sex offenders  Rose West or Myra Hindley  are assumed to have been to some extent acting out the desires of a dominant male, like Fred West (who some say was abused by his own mother Daisy from the age of 12) or Ian Brady. Michelle Elliott, founder of Kidscape, says that a rare conference on female sexual offenders she attended was disrupted by angry feminazis, who shouted down participants who dared discuss the topic on stage.
But after Lakey, we simply cant escape the knowledge that a female child abuser is drawn to schools, to teaching, to childcare, just as male child abusers are, and just as an alcoholic cant stay away from pubs and clubs. Like Anne Lakey, they can often operate undercover, undetected, confident that either neo-Victorian feminists dont believe women can be child-sex predators, or that people secretly agree with Greer, who once said a boys erection implies consent. (Im a fan of Greer, but this statement is tantamount to saying that a girl who involuntarily orgasms during rape enjoys it.)
The judges sentencing of Lakey to eight years jail is exemplary for good reason.
Whether the wimmin of Britain like it or not, whats sauce for the gander must also be sauce for the goose.
A hint of 'mum tum' might make you smile too, Amal
After I had my daughter I was still wearing tents from what was then Evans Outsize nine months later.
People would ask when the baby was due. Zara Tindall doesnt appear to care about her mum tum, either  certainly not enough to invest in a pair of Spanx, anyway.
Its far more reassuring to see a beautiful woman waxing than waning away, like Amal Clooney, who turned up at Westminster with withers skinnier than an Ascot thoroughbred.
And if it turns out Zara does have a bun in the oven after all, jollier still.

Killed by too much kindness
Carl Thompson, Britains fattest man, is dead
Carl Thompson, Britains fattest man, is dead. He ate 10,000 calories a day, dining on Chinese food, curries, and pizzas that he ordered online.
Immobile, he lived off disability allowance and had NHS carers who did his lunches.
His carers sound like lovely people and were clearly very fond of him. But as I listened to one reminisce on the radio about his favourite lunch of sausage, beans and chips, I couldnt help thinking that the State did not help Carl. In fact it was his  in therapy-speak  enabler.
He knew, and said, he had to lose 45 stone or he would die. He knew and said what he needed was a dietitian and shrink. Instead he was provided with a series of suppliers.
Im not saying his death was state-sponsored euthanasia, but it comes pretty close.

Gym weights aren't the real enemy
The sheriffs of California have taken on face value the ironic hip-hop lyric that says: Guns dont kill people, rappers do.
They charged Diddy (aka rapper Sean Combs) with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon after he grabbed a kettlebell gym weight in anger. I do wish US law enforcement would come down as hard on gun-owners as they do on rappers.
Its not long since Dylann Roof, 21, mowed down nine black worshippers in Charleston using a legal firearm.
The deadly weapons infesting America are not kettlebells, or even medicine balls. They are guns. In the US, people are killed with firearms at 297 times the rate of Japan and 49 times the rate of France.
There are 88 guns per 100 people in the US, the highest in the world. If Obama leaves office having done one decent thing, he will repeal the Second Amendment enshrining the right to bear arms. The Presidencys failure to do anything about the millions of deadly weapons in the Land of the Gun is a national tragedy.

Im taking the kids to Greece this summer, where its easier and actually cheaper to feed everyone in local tavernas than it is to eat at home.
But now VAT on eating out there may be hoicked to 23 per cent. So, yet again, the Greeks are getting a free lunch and we  the two million of us from the UK who go there each year  are paying.
Wail! I know were worried about Grexit and all that, but what about the cost of my big fat Greek holiday, and all my Mums nights off?

	When this country was independent, the Queen was the head of our nation, the lady to whom we are subjects, but can she still be out sovereign ad a subject of the European Union?

I wonder if she has noticed this change, or been worried by it. I suspect not. It has just happened to her, as it has happened to everyone else. We have quietly become a different people in a different country.
Like most of us, she has probably heard the slow advance of the EU into our national life as background noise, a dreary constant swoosh, like distant traffic.
Buckingham Palace insists, against all the evidence, that Her Majestys EU citizenship in no way affects her prerogatives, rights and responsibilities as the Sovereign and Head of State. Given that the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg is the final arbiter of law in this country now, and that Parliament and our so-called Supreme Court are subject to it, that simply isnt so.
Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Berlin's Mayor Michael Mueller speak to wellwishers on Pariser Platz in Berlin
Queen ends Berlin trip by driving through Brandenburg Gate
This sort of thing may appear mystical but actually it matters. Its why armies defend their standards to the end, why we have Royal symbols on state documents, postage stamps, the cap-badges of soldiers and policemen, coins and seals.
The EUs leaders know it matters. Thats why they made her an EU citizen. And how pleased they must have been to hear her, in Berlin on Wednesday, trotting out their standard propaganda line that division in Europe is a bad thing and that unity is the source of safety.
Really? For centuries, it was firm British policy to keep the Continent divided, to make sure its great powers left us alone. The safest period of my lifetime was the Cold War, when Europe was more sharply divided than ever.
As she spoke, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, nodded enthusiastically. And if Mrs Merkel thought the Queen was making a political point, Id back her judgment against any statements or briefings from British officials.
Could Downing Street, the Foreign Office and Buckingham Palace have imagined for a second that such a speech would not be interpreted as an endorsement of Britains continued EU membership?
Yet all would have seen it in advance and the Government could have stopped it if they wanted.
They didnt. Without doubt, the Queens personal acceptance of her role as a loyal EU servant was one of the great symbolic moments of our history. A bit like Magna Carta, but backwards.

Farewell to the ultimate Englishman
I'm not sure I have ever enjoyed anything on TV as much as I liked watching Patrick Macnee playing John Steed in The Avengers, especially when Diana Rigg was at his side.
Here was an Englishman - funny, chivalrous, fundamentally gentle, yet deadly to his enemies.
From his obituaries, I gather that he was really like that. What a pleasant change it makes from all those actors, famous for playing noble roles, who turn out to have been secretly mean and nasty.
Real gentleman:Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee in The Avengers in 1965. What a pleasant change to hear that people genuinely did see him as a gentleman and it wasn't purely an act
Crazed killers: The clue everyone ignores
When I lived in the suburbs of Washington DC, I was rather proud that my landlord was almost the only African-American in my unofficially segregated neighbourhood (the other one was the adopted child of our admirable next-door neighbours).
Like many American houses, ours had a small flagpole over the front door, normally used for the Stars And Stripes.
I asked the owner if hed object if I flew a Union Jack from it.
Not at all, he replied. You can fly any flag you like there, from anywhere in the world, as long as it isnt the Confederate Battle Flag.
For him, it was a nasty symbol of cruelty and hate.
From then on, I always took seriously the arguments of those who said the Confederate banner was a real issue, not just a bit of nostalgia.
And if it no longer flies in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol, I for one wont be grieving. Its one good effect of the Charleston massacre.
But what a pity that this dispiriting event has not led to any examination of the role of legal and illegal mind-altering drugs in rampage killings, an issue which is in my view much more pressing.
Its still going on. Authority doesnt look or doesnt care. Two and two are not put together.
The Charleston suspect, as Ive pointed out, appears to have been a drug abuser.
Now we have another  British  case which ought to have made people think, but hasnt.
The gruesome murder of the blameless 82-year-old mother and grandmother, Palmira Silva (her killer cut her head off), received less coverage than it should have. But it had much in common with two other recent crimes  the murder of Lee Rigby in 2011 by two obviously crazed men in London and the beheading of Jennifer Mills-Westley in Tenerife in 2011, also by a crazed individual.
All these killers had one thing in common  heavy cannabis use.
The frightful injuries they inflicted on their victims were signs that they were not sane.
The killers cannabis use was, in all cases, reported as a footnote or a side-issue. What if it is a cause?
But we will never find out if we do not look or ask.

There are no car chases or sex scenes in the interesting new film Mr Holmes. Instead, we see the great detective living out his final lonely years as a pottering beekeeper, played by Sir Ian McKellen in a silk top hat, left. Its a quiet, rather kind story full of thought. And it contains one heartfelt line from Holmes, who complains passionately that in real life, logic is very rare. So it is, and it is his steely attachment to reason and facts, while all about him jump to conclusions, that makes Holmes live on from age to age, in a hundred different incarnations.

PIXIE GELDOF: BEDTIME CLOWN
Shes so young, and in what appears to be pyjamas, I am tempted to read her a bedtime story.
But she looks pretty, and relaxed, and fresh in these Topshop trousers.
Red nose rating: ** Warm Coco
KIMBERLEY WALSH: A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT
I quite like the lemon top with the print culottes from Topshop, but why not wear a skirt?
Culottes remind me of playing hockey in the mud at school.
Its a little bit man-repelling, as well.
Red nose rating: ** Warm Coco
LADY HELEN TAYLOR: CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINER
Normally stylish and tailored, Lady Helen looks as though she has just got out of bed.
Polka dots belong only on children.
We cant see her feet in these Ralph Lauren pants, so she could well be on castors.
Red nose rating: ** Warm Coco
KIM KARDASHIAN: LION TAMER
This is a perfect illustration of how not to wear palazzo pants: DO NOT FILL THEM OUT with your delicious curves.
Striped only exaggerate your wobbly bits. Again, these Balmain trousers are too long, so she has no feet.
Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown
JENNIFER LOPEZ: SHOW TIME

I love the colour and fabric of his Solace London pair, but again, why not wear a skirt?
But she looks pretty, fresh, and is laughing probably at the reflection in the mirror.

Red nose rating: *** Warm Coco
IMAN: RINGMASTER

I can see what she is trying to do here: a trompe loeil to make her legs leaner and longer.
The stripe in this Balmain design defeats the purpose of palazzos. If you want narrow legs, just wear toothpick jeggings.Fact-box text
Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown

LADY GAGA: WHAT A BOZO!
The ultimate clown.
And whod have thought the woman who wore a meat dress would wear something that looks as though it is linen and from Per Una at M&amp;S?
Just ghastly, and these Marni trousers are too bunchy round the waist.

Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown
PS: THE JOKE'S ON MEN TOO
Men are not exempt from this ridiculous trend... as this model on the Walter Von Beirendonck catwalk at Paris Men's Fashion Week proved.
If a man turned up on a date in this childish pink pyjamas-style suit, he'd be arrested.
I can't see men, used to a lean and narrow 'Hedi Slimane for Dior' shape, will take to these.
Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown
Thumbs up: Liz Jones said she looked and felt like Coco the Clown wearing the Palazzo pants
LIZ'S RED NOSE FASHION VERDICT
Posing in palazzo pants I not only looked and felt like Coco (the Clown, not Chanel), I was rendered so wide I could not only be used as a pair of curtains, I could cause a total eclipse of the sun.
The cropped pairs were even worse, turning me into a moving square.
Palazzo pants (in the 1970s, we called them Oxford bags) only look passable on the very young, very tall, and very thin  the stylist on the shoot, who is all of these things, kept saying shed wear these horrors on holiday.
Her friends can wave goodbye to any chance of getting a tan given the huge shadow theyll cast.
These trousers (Zara, 17.99) feel very cheap and nasty.
The fabric is so thin they give me a VPL, and the high waist means my fat tummy is accentuated.
Just awful. If I wore them on the beach, Id be worried a gust of wind would have me paragliding.

	I believe George Osborne should use next week's Budget to bring the top rate of tax back down from 45 to 40 per cent, writes JOHN REDWOOD, Tory MP for Wokingham.

Even Arsenals manager Arsene Wenger complained that the best footballers were being lured to Spain by their preferential top rate.
Once they were safely in opposition, Labour hurled insults at any Conservative who argued that we should return to a 40 per cent rate. They claimed that we just wanted tax breaks for our rich friends.
Despite this onslaught, the Coalition lowered the top rate to 45 per cent. I argued at the time that it would lead to greater tax revenues from the rich. And now I can prove that was right.
Gordon Brown was wrong about almost everything throughout his political career, but not about tax
An analysis of the latest Treasury figures shows that in 2009-10  the last year in which the 40 per cent rate applied  the top 1 per cent of all earners in the country paid 26.5 per cent of the total income tax revenue.
But during the three years in which the 50 per cent rate applied, the amount dropped to 25 per cent of all income tax. Then, in the first year of the 45 per cent rate, the amount shot up to 28 per cent.
What part of that extra money does Labour not comprehend?
At a time when the deficit inherited from Labours extravagant spending, and the great crash caused by Mr Browns boom and bust, is much too high, we need every extra penny of tax revenue we can get.
That means we need to get more from the rich by lowering the top rate. We will not tackle the deficit and provide vital public services if the UK blun-ders on with an uncompetitive tax rate which sends banking business to Hong Kong, high-tech entrepreneurs to California and media stars to Hollywood.
Many of the very rich work for themselves, or have big shareholdings in companies which pay them an income. This means they have enormous flexibility to raise or lower their incomes in response to the fiscal regime.
When the rate hit 50 per cent, many of them decided to pay themselves a lower income and simply reinvest the money in their businesses.
Either that, or they diverted their savings into assets that produced less income and more potential capital gain.
George Osborne should use next weeks Budget to bring the top rate of tax back down from 45 to 40 per cent
Now that the rate has gone down to 45 per cent, more rich people live here, more of them pay themselves higher incomes and more are prepared to pay the tax. If, for example, you look at the figures for self-assessment income tax  which includes a lot of the top payers  you see a stunning drop in revenues.
When the top rate rose to 50p, the Treasury forecast that the amount it would bring in would jump from 21.7 billion to 29.2 billion by 2013. Instead, it fell to 20.6 billion that year, a massive write-down of 8.6 billion.
The Treasury was wrong in forecasting the adverse impact of a higher rate, and also completely wrong about the level of economic growth.
So what would cutting the rate to 40 per cent do? It would boost revenues.
When former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson cut the top rate from 60 per cent to 40 in the 1980s, the rich paid more in tax, and they paid a higher share of the tax collected as a result.
Cutting the top rate in the next Budget will doubtless bring the same misinformed howls of anguish from the Left, who will claim that the Conservatives are always too soft on the rich.
Our response should be that we want to get more tax revenue from the rich  and are adopting Gordon Browns method of doing so. This Government should also cut the overall tax burden by removing the lower paid from income tax altogether, and by raising the 20p and the 40p thresholds for all.
Labour are now saying they wish to be a party of aspiration as well as a party of higher benefits. If you believe in this idea, then you need to allow those who succeed to keep more than half of what they earn.
The General Election result in May showed that voters are not, as Labour had hoped, jealous of those who work hard. The electorate understands that some people will do better than others, and accepts high wages for successful people who run their own companies or who have otherwise made their mark.
The Chancellor should be bold. Whatever he does, the Opposition will cry that the Conservatives are the party of the rich.
What we as a party have to show is that we are not trying to be exclusively on the side of the rich. Taxing them sensibly will mean they provide more money for the rest of us to spend, and more jobs to fuel the recovery.
The Government should ignore these baleful, misguided criticisms. It is time for Mr Osborne to heed the growing calls from his partys backbenches and unleash the animal spirits of the most enterprising elements of our society.
John Redwood is the Conservative MP for Wokingham and a former Cabinet Minister

	Ali Bin Muhammad Rezgui, the uncle of ISIS killer Seifeddine Rezgui, said his nephew had been a 'sweet' child, but began attending mosques run by radical Imams in recent years.

By the time he launched his killing spree in Sousse, Rezgui was said to be working with IS, which yesterday posted a picture of him with two assault rifles either side of him, on its website.
Using Rezguis jihadi name, Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani, it described him as Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate.
ISIS extremists have claimed the massacre which left 38 dead was an 'attack upon the nests of fornication, vice and disbelief in God' - as they warned 'worse is to follow'.
The threat accompanied a picture of the man ISIS claim was behind the assault on innocent holidaymakers, who they name asAbu Yahya Qayrawani.
It is thought this is jihadi name of the killer fatally shot by authorities after Friday's attack, a 23-year-old aviation student called Seifeddine Rezgui, who was armed with an assault rifle and grenades.
Bodies lie on a beach in Sousse after gunmen opened fire on tourists at two hotels, killing at least 38
Killed: A 16-year-old British boy saw his grandmother and parents gunned down by the men who killed 38 (one pictured)
It has been reported that the attack happened on the private beach of the Royal Kenz Hotel, which is situated 400 metres away
The statement accompanying the picture added: 'Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate, Abu Yahya al Qayrawani, reached his target the Imperial hotel despite the security measures.'
Sky report the statement goes on to say he had attacked a 'bordel' and killed 40 'infidels'.
It is yet to be confirmed whether this definitely is the same man who murdered 38 tourists staying at a hotel in Sousse, Tunisia.
Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said Rezgui was not previously known by authorities, and came from the town of Gaafour in the governorate of Siliana and had been a student at Kairouan university.
A second gunman is reported to have escaped, but details remain unclear.
Eyewitness accounts say Rezgui was was seen laughing and joking among the midday bathers and sunseekers, looking like any other tourist.
But it was claimed he was carefully selecting the victims he would murder with a Kalashnikov hidden in his parasol.
Footage shows inside Seifeddine Rezgui's abandoned apartment
Images purporting to show the inside of killerSeifeddine Rezgui's apartment have emerged. The property appears to be filthy, while this image shows all he kept in the fridge was a few chili peppers
Rubbish litters the apartment, while on the dinner table appears to be a knife and fork, left there before he left to commit his atrocities
The British were his prime targets on the crowded Tunisian beachfront at El Kantaoui near Sousse.
But Germans, Belgians and Tunisians were also among his 38 victims  with 36 seriously wounded.
'He was laughing and joking around, like a normal guy,' said one witness. 'He was choosing who to shoot. Some people, he was saying to them 'you go away'. He was choosing tourists, British, French.'
Tonight images have also emerged purporting to show the inside of Rezgui's apartment.
The dirty flat is covered with rubbish, with a knife and fork still on the dinner table which were left there as he went out to commit his atrocities.
As the camera looks inside his fridge, there appears to be nothing inside except for two small potatoes and several chili peppers, while the inside is also covered with grime.

	Mykal Porter, 22, collapsed and died while football training, six days after medics at Rotherham Hospital, Yorkshire, failed to tell him he needed emergency treatment for a blood clot in his chest.

Dr Bardsley told the inquest he believed Mr Porter would probably still be alive if he had looked at the scan on the day it was performed and called him back into hospital.
He admitted he would have acted immediately if he had looked at the scan, but said he was under pressure to perform ward rounds.
During the hearing Dr Bardsley accepted that looking at the scan was a 'two minute job' and could have been performed on virtually any computer.
'I've reflected on this so many times over the last few months,' Dr Bardsley told the hearing.
'There were opportunities, and I wasn't helped by circumstances, but certainly several opportunities fell at my door and I didn't take them. I feel I should have.'

Mr Porter was the player manager of Barnsley Sunday League teamCarlton Athletic. Pictured: Mr Porter is in the back row wearing the black jumper.

After Dr Bardsley looked at the scan he asked a secretary to contact Mr Porter and get him to hospital.
The medic assumed his patient had got this message, but after learning, the following day, Mr Porter had not been in touch, he had a a letter faxed to his GP.
But it was not marked 'urgent' and was treated as 'routine mail' by the surgery.
Mr Porter's GP did not read it until after his death.
Dr Bardsley said he had referred himself to the General Medical Council and was awaiting their verdict, saying it had completely devastated him.
'Will I return to work after this? I doubt it. It has affected me very deeply,' he said.
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater said 'there were a number of missed opportunities to recognise the urgency of the situation and the importance of contact with Mr Porter.'
She continued: 'On the balance of probabilities had Mr Porter been contacted and appropriate treatment commenced in a timely manner it is likely his death would have been avoided.'
After the verdict, Mr Porter's father, Norman, 57, said: 'I'm glad it's been officially recorded, what we already knew, that Mykal should still be here. I can't say it any plainer than that.'
Tracey McErlain-Burns, chief nurse at Rotherham Hospital said afterwards: 'On behalf of the Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust I apologise for the failures in care and express sincere condolences to Mr Porter's family.'

	The hard-liners will tip the balance of the 23-strong ruling council in favour of activists which has led MPs to fear their focus will move away from welfare and towards aggressive animal rights campaign.

He added: A lot of people give money to the charity for genuine animal welfare work. But it is the management and lack of governance that is letting the charity down.
The make-up of the committee is to be finalised this week and if MPs support his wish to investigate the charity, Mr Parish said he would summon RSPCA chiefs to be quizzed in public to find out how it is run and what improvements can be made.
MPs are especially anxious over the failure of the charity to appoint a new chief executive.
The former incumbent, Gavin Grant, left 18 months ago, due to ill-health. During his tenure he presided over high-profile campaigns against hunting, the badger cull and the Grand National. But what were seen as aggressive campaigning and bullying tactics in bringing prosecutions for animal cruelty provoked a public backlash.
RSPCA donations dropped by 7 million, the charity was forced to make redundancies and, for the first time in its history, had to arrange an overdraft facility.
Morale among RSPCA staff is said to be low, with many being forced to accept short-term rolling contracts.
Richard Ryder believes animals should never be killed for food, clothing or sport. An ex-chairman of the Political Animal Lobby, which donated 1.1m to Labour to ban hunting
A number of experienced people interested in the chief executive post have been put off by in-fighting between moderates and radicals on the council, plus its resistance to any change to the way members are elected.
For example, Dr Richard Ryder, regarded as the father of the modern animal rights movement, has served on the council since 1972, while the norm for charity council or board members these days is to serve a maximum three-year terms.
An indication of the influence of the hardliners running the RSPCA will be evident on Wednesday when the new council meets for the first time to elect a chairman.
Mike Tomlinson, the current chairman, a moderate, who has also been acting chief executive, has decided to step down from the role.
David Canavan, a barrister and considered moderate, is a favourite for the post.
But a number of animal welfare experts fear the post could go to a hardliner who would then influence the appointment of the new chief executive.
The make-up of the council roughly comprises ten moderates, ten hardliners and three who could vote for either side.
One charity chief said: If there are absentees, the vote is wide open. A lot of us are very worried that the charity could be at risk.
A Government animal welfare adviser added: The problem is, people are on the council for their ideology and not for their competence.
An RSPCA insider said: Weve had more than 100 applicants for the post of chief executive and interviews are still being held.
A Charity Commission spokeswoman said it was monitoring the RSPCA and in dialogue with its trustees but legally could not interfere with governance arrangements of charities.

	Critics said it meant the British people will have to accept a 'post-dated cheque' because any reforms Mr Cameron achieves could be reversed later before being written into a treaty.

Voters in Britain's referendum on leaving the European Union will not know for certain that David Cameron has got a better deal, it has emerged.
The Prime Minister claimed he was 'delighted' after raising his reforms at a dinner last night but he has been told he will not be able to change the EU's complex treaties before his planned in-out vote by the end of 2017.
Critics said it meant the British people will have to accept a 'post-dated cheque' because any reforms Mr Cameron achieves could be unpicked by other countries before being written into a new treaty.
David Cameron, pictured arriving at the summit in Brussels today, has declared himself 'delighted' to have kicked off the formal renegotiation process which will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union
Mr Cameron was seen deep in conversation withLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on the second day of the EU summit today
WHAT ARE CAMERON'S KEY DEMANDS FOR EU REFORM?
FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:
No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years
No social housing for four years
No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK
FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:
No support from the UK taxpayer
Deportation if they do not get a job for six months
OTHER IMMIGRATION MEASURES:
Restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU
Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK
Tougher rules on deporting foreign criminals
Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels
PROTECTIONS FROM EU INTERFERENCE:
A special 'opt-out' from the principle of 'ever closer union' between EU states
Measures to strengthen national parliaments to club together to block Brussels diktats
Rules to protect the influence of countries outside the Eurozone
The Conservative government has pledged to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum on whether to accept the new deal or go it alone.
Mr Cameron had demanded 'proper, full-on treaty change' to ensure his promised reforms could not be reversed.
But with some EU leaders it could take 10 years to negotiate a new treaty which some countries would have to put to a referendum, Downing Street now accepts it will not happen before 2017.
The Prime Minister is now saying he would accept an 'irreversible lock' or a 'legally binding' guarantee that EU law will be changed at some future point to accommodate Britain's renegotiation.
Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland are all expected to hold their own referendums to approve any change to the EU's treaties.
Labour accused the Prime Minister of retreating in the face of opposition from other EU states.
Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said: 'All year the Prime Minister has been saying that change to the treaty was a definite requirement and yet now, faced with entirely predictable opposition from other member states, he is signalling retreat while pretending that all he ever wanted was a post-dated cheque.'
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'It sounds like a post-dated cheque. There are so many big things happening that a promissory note of some kind to Britain may well finish up not being honoured.
'Post-dated cheques can bounce and one suspects that any post-dated cheque that was given to the Brits would be given by presidents and prime ministers in office now.
'By the time it came to be honoured there would be different prime ministers and presidents elected on a ticket saying we won't honour this note. It doesn't work any way you look at it.'
Key demands include curbing access to benefits for migrants, ending the concept of 'ever closer union', giving national governments the power to veto Brussels diktats and securing protection for the interests of EU members, like the UK, which do not use the euro.
After defying the polls to secure an overall Conservative majority in May's election, Mr Cameron believes he has a mandate to deliver serious reform.
In a boost for his plans, the issue was on the EU agenda for the first time last night.
But Mr Cameron spoke for around 10 minutes during a working dinner dominated by bitter rows over which EU countries would take thousands of migrants from north Africa.

	Wolfprint 3D offers face sculptures modelled from ultrasound scans

	Wolfprint 3D, an Estonian company, is offering expectant-mothers 3D sculptures of their unborn children for up to £300. It is the first time the technology has been seen in the UK.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
The images are sent to a 3D printer which creates the final likeness, layer-by-layer, from plastic resin.
Hannah Bramley, 27, is 35 weeks pregnant with her third child, a daughter, and chose to have a sculpture made by Wolfprint after having a detailed scan at a local clinic, Miracle in Progress, in Loughborough, Leicestershire. She paid 80 for the private 3D scan when she was 28 weeks pregnant, and a further 150 for the sculpture to be made  but says it was money well spent.
Emotional: Midwife Jo Proud poses with Hannah Bramley and her sculpture which she says has brought her closer to her unborn daughter
The ultrasound scan that 3D prints unborn baby sculptures
She said: I cried when I saw it for the first time. I had 3D scans done with both of my older boys but this was totally different. Its impossible to explain. You can touch it. My sister thought it was freaky, but I think its amazing. It feels like shes already here. Its strange, but I do probably feel closer to her than I did to my other babies when I was pregnant.
Joanna Proud of Miracle in Progress, added: Every mother likes to feel an extra bond with their unborn child.
Dr Bryan Beattie offers the service at Innermost Healthcare in Cardiff. He said: What you see is a little person who you can relate to, rather than a black and white image which you know is a foetus but could be anyones. The cost is still high because the technology is so new but were hoping it will come down as more people sign up. It could prove helpful for people expecting babies with facial deformities such as cleft lip, and even surgeons planning corrective operations after birth.
Technology: The sculpture is created from images of a 3D scan (seen above on an ultrasound monitor)
Standard NHS scans are generally only 2D and the image quality is poor because they are designed to see through the babys skin to view the internal organs.
But private clinics spend longer using standard ultrasound to take lots of two-dimensional slices which are put together to create a 3D effect. They also appear clearer because the organs are not shown.
The Health Protection Agency has warned women against so-called souvenir scans because of potential risks to the unborn baby, as they require longer and more intense exposure to ultrasound, the effects of which are untested
Kaspar Tiri of Wolfprint 3D, said: We were a company producing 3D models for architects and the construction industry and then a friends wife got pregnant, so we thought, why cant we create 3D models of the babies?
The reaction so far has been amazing. For a parent to not only see but touch their childs face before it is born is very special.

	The United Nations called on Britain to accept its share of thousands of people from North Africa, after a Brussels dinner was dominated by arguments over where the migrants should settle.

Peter Sutherland, special representative of the UN secretary-general for international migration and development, said it was wrong for some countries to turn their back on the plan.
Hetold BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'All member states should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark.
'This is a question basically of European solidarity. Why should Greece and particularly Italy take this unfair burden of responsibility for people who are refugees escaping from persecution?'
All member states should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark
Peter Sutherland, United Nations
He said providing ships to rescue migrants found at sea was 'not enough'.
Leaders have agreed to relocate 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other EU countries over the next two years, in an effort to share the burden of a growing crisis.
They also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq.
Italy wanted a quota system to be created to fix numbers of migrants to be sent to each country, but after facing criticism from other countries plan will now be voluntary.
A working dinner in Brussels continued into the small hours of this morning as leaders failed to agree on how to tackle the crisis.
Mr Renzi turned onHungary, Poland and Lithuania, whose leaders say they won't be forced to take any.
He told them: 'If you don't agree on 40,000, you aren't worthy of calling yourselves Europe'.
In what was described by diplomatic sources as an 'emotional' outburst, he then said pointedly: 'If that's your idea of Europe, you can keep it'.
David Cameron, pictured arriving at the Brussels summit today, has vowed to use a British veto to opt out of any EU-wide plan to spread 40,000 migrants across the continent
Mr Renzi has urged other EU countries to sign up to a plan to relocate migrants, but Mr Cameron has refused to accept any in the UK
Mr Cameron was seen deep in conversation withLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on the second day of the EU summit today
Now member states will have to agree on how many asylum seekers they are willing to take by mid-July, but it will be voluntary not mandatory, much to the anger of Italy, who receive the bulk of the migrants.
Mr Renzi said afterwards the outcome of the meeting fell short of what Italy needed. 'Relocation is a first step but for us this is not the solution to our problems.'
Britain has already said it will use its veto to avoid taking any of the migrants, and around 12 other states, many from eastern Europe, are also opposed to taking a set number.
Last weekTheresa May  called for the migrants crossing the Mediterranean to be forcibly sent back to Africa as a deterrent and to show there was 'no merit' in coming to Europe.
Figures released last week revealed that 100,000 migrants have made the crossing from North Africa to southern Europe since January alone, with 57,000 landing in Italy.
European council President Donald Tusk (left) and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker denied being at odds over how to tackle the migrant crisis
An estimated 170,000 migrants reached Italy by sea last year. But only a third of them claimed asylum there, with the rest likely to have headed for northern Europe, including Britain.
EU officials last night tried to diffuse the row and claimed that the talks were a success because a total of 60,000 migrants in Italy and Greece - 40,000 who came by boat and 20,000 from Syria - would be resettled.
A European source said the EU's two top figures, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, had clashed at the meeting but the two rejected the suggestion.
'Don't believe those who are tweeting, leaking info. Whenever we have difficulties, we discuss these things between ourselves,' Mr Juncker said at a press conference.
Britain has used its veto avoid taking migrants directly andTheresa May has demanded that they be forcibly sent back to Africa
Around 60,000 people have arrived in Europe from north Africa so far this year, while 2,000 are estimated to have died while making the dangerous journey
Royal Navy rescue 369 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea
Mr Juncker insisted that what really mattered was that EU leaders had approved the numbers of asylum seekers to be resettled as proposed by the Commission.
'I don't care if it is to be done voluntarily or not because the most important thing was that we agreed on the 60,000,' he said.
MrTusk, a former Polish premier whose country opposes the quota system, said 'migrants with no legal right to enter the EU will be returned' and negotiations with countries of origin would be speeded up to take them.
He has insisted that with 'no consensus' on quotas, EU member states should instead make realistic voluntary offers of refuge to deal with the upsurge in migrants.
'The voluntary scheme cannot be an excuse to do nothing. I can understand those who want this voluntary mechanism but they will only be credible if they give precise and significant pledges by the end of July at the latest,' he said.
'Solidarity without sacrifice is pure hypocrisy. Now we don't need empty declarations on solidarity, only deeds and numbers,' Mr Tusk added.
Stand-off: David Cameron speaks to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last night, one of the men that Matteo Menzi, front right, became irate with last night
Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz and Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite were also said to have been rebuked by the Italians
Last night David Cameron declared himself 'delighted' after he used the dinner to kick off the formal renegotiation process which will pave the way for an in/out referendum.
Mr Cameron secured agreement for 'technical' talks between UK and EU officials over the next six months on British concerns including restricting welfare for EU migrants, an opt-out from the goal of 'ever-closer union' in Europe, greater powers for national parliaments and protections for countries - like the UK - which are not members of the single currency.
Speaking as he left the talks at around 2.45am, Mr Cameron said: 'I am delighted that the process of British reform and renegotiation and the referendum we are going to hold - that process is now properly under way.
'People always say to me these things aren't possible, we will never get them done. Once again, we have proved we will get them done. We have started that process and it's under way.'

	Tory rebellion as new Ministers join Brian May's war on hunting

	The Queen guitarist, pictured, has recruited Sports Minister Tracey Crouch and up-and-coming MPs Dominic Raab and Caroline Dineage on his campaign to oppose the 'bloodsport'.

May said: I dont hate the man (Cameron) but I hate the fact that he wants to make hunting legal again. I find that abhorrent. He added that hunting was uniquely cruel because the people who are doing it are doing it for pleasure.
The Conservatives Election victory has led to some Tory MPs pressing Cameron to use the partys majority  and its traditional support for hunting  to lift the ban imposed by Tony Blairs Government.
They say it was outlawed for petty party political reasons and demonstrated ignorance of the countryside and rural traditions.
However, Mr May claims many young Tory MPs are on his side.
Brian May leads anti-badger cull protesters
Caroline Dineage, left, and Sports Minister Tracey Crouch are said to be supporting Brian May as part of his Team Fox which will oppose the re-introduction of fox hunting, rumoured to be on the cards thanks to a number of Conservatives who remain bitter about the ban introduced by the Blair Government
Newly appointed Ministers Dominic Raab and Caroline Dinenage are among those tipped to support May at his Commons meeting. It will be co-hosted by May and Andrea Jenkins, the Conservative MP and professional singer who defeated Ed Balls in the Election.
May said: A lot of independent-minded younger Tory MPs agree with us that fox hunting is cruel. They will vote according to their conscience.
The Government has no plans to end the Labour ban, but pro-hunting Tory backbenchers hope to launch their own bid. Tuesdays meeting is likely to witness lively exchanges after May invited pro-hunting Tory MPs to attend as well. May claims pro-animal rights Conservative ministers secretly supported his campaign to stop the Governments cull of badgers to combat TB in cattle.
He says that they contacted him to suggest how to undermine the cull.
Its not skulduggery. They were brave enough to say, My party thinks this but I disagree. I have a lot of friends in the Conservative Party, he said.
He refused to name the Ministers. Mays critics say he is irresponsible to oppose the badger cull, introduced to make cattle more healthy.
They also say that his claims about the cruelty of fox hunting are wildly exaggerated.

'I never remember her having a bad day. She was a beautiful-looking girl and so full of joy.
'It didn't matter what time of day I'd see her, first thing in the morning or last thing at night, she was so glam  and I'd turn up in T-shirts and scruffy jeans and old trainers.'
Media personality Clarke - who remains good friends with Michelle's husband Paul added: 'I'm devastated. I'm actually still shaking. My heart goes out to the family and her friends.
Michelle photographed with her boxing legend father, Jim Watt. It's the second family tragedy to befall Jim and wife Margaret, after their son Jim junior died in a car accident in 1995
'It's a really sad day and not having her smile around is a loss.
Make-up expert Craig Alexander Wilson said: 'To hear this is devastating.
'Michelle was easy to work with and a real professional who had a zest for life.
'She loved her industry, was very committed to her family and husband, and I know she was the apple of her father's eye.'
Michelle carved a successful media career after presenting a number of TV programmes, including ITV's interior design hit, 60 Minute Makeover
She was also a regular newspaper columnist, with her bubbly nature and sense of humour said to be purely contagious to those around her
It was in 2008 that Michelle finally got her big break after a decade of smaller television appearances, landing her dream job co-hosting ITV1 show 60 Minute Makeover with Terri Dwyer.
Speaking at the time, she admitted that the role brought together her two passions - TV and interior design, having become qualified following a successful stint studying at the National Design Academy.
It is believed that in recent years, while caring for her young daughter, Michelle helped out with her parents' bridal-car business, often chauffeuring. She also accepted offers to host corporate events around Scotland, and was a guest host on STV magazine series The Hour between 2009 and 2010.
Michelle's father Jim Watt became world lightweight boxing champion in April 1979 after beating Colombian Alfredo Pitalua.
Tributes have poured in for the popular TV presenter, with her showbiz friends left 'devastated' by the news
Lorraine Kelly was previously described by Michelle as her 'inspiration'. The TV favourite this morning Tweeted her shock, describing the 38-year-old as a 'lovely woman and a fantastic mum'
Songstress Michelle McManus - who won Pop Idol in 2003 and is now big in Scottish showbiz - took to Twitter to share her grief
Comedian Des Clarke co-presented dating show Club Cupid with Michelle. In a moving Tweet, he described his former colleague as 'a lovely person', before sending his wishes to her grieving family
After hanging up his gloves in 1981, he became a sports commentator for ITV.
He moved to join Sky Sports in 1996, where he continues to broadcast as both a pundit and co-commentator, commenting recently on the $200million fight between Flloyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2.

April 1979 - At nearly two years old, her father becomes World Lightweight Champion after knocking-out Colombian fighter Alfredo Pitalua in front of a packed Glasgow crowd

His daughter's death comes just months before the 20th anniversary of son Jim junior's passing.
The 17-year-old died after being involved in a sickening smash in which one other man was killed on October 30, 1995.
Opening up about Jim junior's death on Radio Scotland show 'Stuff of Legends' five years ago, the Southpaw fighter described the horror his demise had brought to his and wife Margaret's lives.
He said: 'It was the lowest point of my life. You shouldn't bury your children - your children should bury you.
'That was horrendous. My wife has been left in a terrible state. She'll never get her head around it. The way I get my head around it was the way I've pretty much dealt with my whole life.
'When I was boxing there were things I had to do and things I couldn't do in order to get fit.
'I could channel my mind in a certain way. And I think the way I dealt with the death of young Jim was I tried to keep it out of my head, I didn't let it in.
'It was a horrendous time, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It was just terrible and tragic.
'He was 17 and it was a car accident. I'd just got him the car a couple of months before.'
Tragically, Jim also suffered the loss of his father when he was just a child.
In a 2006 interview with the Sun, Michelle admitted that she was still then living haunted by her younger brother's death, confessing that even after a decade her heart-wrenching loss was still 'very raw and painful.'
Aged 28 at the time, she said: 'Sometimes I think I spot him in a crowd of people and I find myself doing a double take.
'You think you are alright and then suddenly 'wham!' - it just gets you right in the heart.
'Losing him was very hard on my family. But I think that's one of the reasons my parents' marriage is so strong today.
Michelle's father Jim Watt is a much-respected boxing pundit with Sky Sports (left). He had a hugely successful in-ring career, including becoming lightweight champion of the world (right)
'If they can survive that they can survive anything.'
Michelle and car sales manager husband Paul had been together since she was 14.
She was just really fun to be around and such a lovely, genuine person and so hard-working
Comedian Des Clarke
They only recently moved into their dream home following Jaymi's birth, who Michelle conceded would be her only child.
She made the decision after her morning sickness during pregnancy became so unbearable that she had to routinely attend hospital - affecting her ability to present live television.
Police Scotland confirmed Michelle's death.
A spokesman said: 'Police in Forth Valley were called to an address around 6.15pm on Wednesday June 24 where the body of a 38-year-old woman was found.
'There are no suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.'

	The Navy spent £10 million on redundancy payments for 500 engineers in 2011, but is now urgently attempting to lure some of them back to fill a shortfall of 250 positions.

Naval engineers who have recently retired are also being rehired on one-year rolling contracts. A new advert on the Navys website says: The Royal Navy is actively seeking to re-recruit marine engineers and weapons engineers... If you miss the camaraderie, variety and challenge of engineering in the Navy then we can offer a tailored re-entry that could allow you to continue your rating career where you left off.
The Navy cut 5,000 sailors from the fleet in 2010 in a bid to fill a 38 billion black hole created by years of MoD mismanagement. But the fleet has now been left with a desperate skills gap.
Hiring again: The Royal Navy is being forced to rehire staff it made redundant to cover a shortfall
Last year, the frigate HMS Richmond had to withdraw from a major Nato training exercise in the Mediterranean after just three of its engineers fell ill.
Admirals have announced that ships deployed to the Gulf and South Atlantic will stay away from home for nine months rather than six because of the cuts and crew shortages.
Commanders also plan to borrow 36 engineers from the US Coastguard and have launched a recruitment drive in Commonwealth countries to find new engineers. Admiral Lord West, a former head of the Navy, described the situation as ludicrous last night, adding: Time and again we have been too fast to discard the services of highly trained people only to be caught short later on. We should be very wary in the future of discarding highly skilled people because inevitably circumstances change and you need them back.
Sources fear the Navy is in the cusp of a crisis after 630 personnel quit in the past year, including 12 per cent of engineering ratings and eight per cent of engineering officers. One senior source described the exodus as unprecedented, saying: So many are leaving because there are so few engineers in the UK and the top companies are willing to pay huge salaries.
A Navy spokesman said the service used innovative measures to address nationally acknowledged challenges, adding: These measures are already producing results allowing the Navy to continue to deliver maritime capability where it is needed.

'Their propensity to commit crimes where the risk appears to me to outweigh the gain has most surprised me. I mean, would you climb on to the front of a moving vehicle for as little as 150?'.
Romanians have the highest per capita population in British jails of any foreign nationality, with 674 of the 128,000-strong population in jail or on remand.

More than 850 passengers had to be evacuated after their Mediterranean cruise ship collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Turkey, leaving a huge dent in its hull.
Authorities said a huge disaster was averted after emergency service quickly responded to reports that the Celestyal Crystal and the tanker STI Pimlico had crashed at 1.30am on Saturday morning in the Dardanelles Strait.
Cruise operators said two crew members and a passenger suffered minor injuries in the accident as the vessel, registered to Malta, made its way from Greece to Istanbul.

All of its 853 passengers and 382 staff were taken to safety by a sea bus to Gallipoil, and the rest of their journey was cancelled while structural damage to the front of the ship is being fixed.
Emergency services moved quickly to douse the tanker in water to prevent a fire or explosion after fuel spilled out of the 182-metre long tanker, which had been travelling from Russia to Malta carrying flammable naptha fuel.
It has not yet been established how the collision took place.

'We are unable to have any sort of justice - even though police know one of them killed my son. I want justice for Sam and for anyone that comes into contact with them in the future.'
Buffham and Bate were arrested on suspicion of murder the day after Sam's death in April 2013 but were released last November without charge.
Tests revealed he had suffered the injuries in the 11 hours before an ambulance was called and he was taken for emergency surgery to relieve the swelling on his brain.
But his condition deteriorated and Sam died four days later on April 24, with his father at his side.
The little boy had been in the care of his mother Deanna Buffham and her boyfriend Ryan Bate at the time
Sam's mother and partner were arrested on suspicion of his murder but released without charge after police failed to prove which of them was responsible
In the days leading up to his death, while he was in intensive care at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, Mr Harry was only told the incident had been a 'trauma'.
'I thought it was standard that police would be in hospital for a case like this. At no point did I know it was because it was being treated as a murder investigation,' he said.
'When they told me they were treating it as murder and said who their main suspects were I just couldn't believe it. It turned my whole world upside down - it still has to this day.'
He added: 'I think it was best I didn't know what had happened at that point because I was just there entirely for Sam at his bedside.'
Mr Harry demanded a review of the CPS decision and was told that it would not be possible to charge both of them 'simply because we know one of them must be guilty of the offence'.
A letter from the CPS read: 'Neither suspect accepts that they caused Sams injuries... each now asserts that the other must have been responsible given the medical findings.
'Although each blames the other, they are unable to give any material evidence to substantiate their belief.'
Sam at Addenbrooke's Hospital, where he had emergency surgery to relieve swelling on his brain
Mr Harry kept a bedside vigil and was shocked when police told him his son's death was being treated as a murder investigation and that the main suspects were his ex-girlfriend and her new partner
Chief prosecutors say because both parties left the house on the day of the incident, they cannot prosecute under a 'joint enterprise' basis
Mr Harry with his son before his death in April 2013. Initially he was not told the details of what had happened
Buffham and Bate were arrested on suspicion of murder the day after Sam's death in April 2013 but were released last November without charge
He has now launched an online petition named Justice for Sam in a bid to overturn the Crown's decision, which needs 100,000 signatures before it can be handed over to Parliament.
'At the moment these two are walking around scot-free. It's inconceivable that they could get a job working with children in the future as they have no criminal record.
'I want the Government to investigate this loophole that allowed both suspects to lie to protect each other and evade prosecution.'
A CPS spokesperson said: 'This case was reviewed as part of the Victims Right to Review Scheme. A specialist prosecutor undertook an independent and comprehensive examination of the evidence.
'This review determined that the original decision to take no further action still stands because there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against either suspect.
'The charges of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child were considered, however, there is insufficient evidence to prove that either one of the suspects caused the little boys injuries, or to prosecute them both on a joint enterprise basis.'
Bedfordshire Police said it is 'not looking at anyone else' in connection with Sam's death, but added that ever murder investigation is subject to reviews including this one.
His father is campaigning to have the decision overturned and is fighting for justice for his little boy
In a letter from the CPS to Mr Harry, they said that they could not prosecute because each party is blaming the other

	Alison and Bob Armitage from Essex thought their daughter Leia, pictured, would live in a forever silent world but thanks to pioneering brain implants, she can now experience sound.

However, the same day medics at Great Ormond Street Hospital suggested they talk to Professor Shakeel Saeed, a neurosurgeon at University College London Hospitals. He wanted to expand the use of auditory brain implants in children in Britain.
But brain surgery had serious risks, the doctors stressed, especially to a toddler, and only a few such operations had ever been carried out on children worldwide. Furthermore, Prof Saeed had not performed the operation on a child before.
Mr Armitage, 42, who works for Royal Mail, recalled: We knew success rates varied. But the first time we met Professor Saeed, he put us at such ease.
The neurologist assembled a team with other experts and in May 2013 Leia had an operation in which they implanted 12 signal-carrying electrodes directly on to the brainstem. They mimic the auditory nerve, carrying electrical signals from a hearing aid type device directly to the brain. One of those involved in the operation, Dan Jiang  head of the Hearing Implant Centre at St Thomas Hospital in London  described the procedure as revolutionary for children with no auditory nerve. It is their only chance of ever accessing sound, he said.
Hope: Medics at Great Ormond Street Hospital suggested that the family talk to Professor Shakeel Saeed, a neurosurgeon at University College London Hospitals, whowanted to expand the use of auditory brain implants in children in Britain
By a quirk of fate, medics decided to switch the new machine on on Leias second birthday. However, they warned Leias parents there was no guarantee of success because initial scans suggested the device hadnt worked.
Mr Armitage said: That was a bad moment for us. We sat there thinking: What have we done? Weve put her through all this trauma, and quite possibly its not going to work.
Mrs Armitage added: When she was switched on, Bob and I didnt see any difference in Leia. But the experts saw movement in her eyes. They saw she was blinking to loud noises, and they were thrilled.
Then, on the Tube home, we noticed she was turning her head when the doors were closing, and shed never done that before. And we thought: Shes hearing something!
Prof Saeed said it was impossible to know how Leia experienced sound, but it was likely to be a very different sensation to those with normal hearing. Her parents said Leia can now understand a wide range of words. Mrs Armitage said: Her hearing has become really finely tuned, and shes hearing some quite low levels of sound now. Nobody in their wildest dreams thought shed get to that level with brainstem surgery.
On her third birthday, they sang Happy Birthday but Leia had not really understood it, they said.
But over the past year her hearing has improved so much that she had started to enjoy watching TV and listening to music.
Prof Saeed said the team hopes to carry out more such operations on children lacking auditory nerves: The alternative is a world of silence.
Better future: Mrs Armitage said nobody in their wildest dreams thought shed get to that level with brainstem surgery. Professor Saeed now wants to carry out more of the operations to help other children in Britain

He adds: 'We're not moving as fast as we need to and part of what I know from watching your programmes, and all the great work you've done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected.
'If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not then we're not going to solve the problem, we're going to have to have a global solution to this.'
Sir David, who was sent an air ticket out of the blue to visit the White House, explained that he believes people must be educated that caring for the planet is our responsibility.
He said: 'I think what's required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance.
Barack Obama interviews Sir David Attenborough at the White House
Sir David Attenborough said: 'On my 89th birthday it was to my considerable surprise to find myself in a place that I've never been to before ... to visit the White House with the President of the United States'
'This is the only planet we've got and we've got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively - it is, after all, where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.'
The interview might also be a pointer towards what Obama is considering for his next career.
Earlier this month, Sir David claimed following the pair's meeting that the US President could follow in the footsteps of former Vice President turned environmentalist Al Gore when he leaves office.
Obama is currently in his second and final term, which will come to an end in January 2017.
This is the only planet we've got and we've got to protect it
Sir David Attenborough
Sir David said he had come away from the interview feeling that Obama was 'very much in favour of dealing with climate change' but got the sense he was 'wondering what he's going to do next'.
It is the latest in a series of unusual media appearances for Obama, who has tried to tap any avenue that reaches as many eyeballs as possible to get his message out.
To reach young people he wanted to sign up for Obamacare, his signature health care insurance program, he talked to comedian Zach Galifianakis for the web series 'Between Two Ferns.'
Obama, a Democrat, has also joked with other comedians on late night television and exploited every possible social media tool, even doing his own jousting in the political arena of Twitter.
Sir David has been making television documentaries for 60 years and has been called 'the godfather of natural history TV' by the BBC.
Big fan: During the interview, Obama tells The Living Planet presenter: 'I have been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time ... you've been a great educator as well as a great naturalist'
Sir David: 'What animal would I be? Probably the leopard slug!'
Obama's interview with Sir David comes as the US President's administration finalises rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants. He has pushed world leaders to agree to new targets at a summit later this year in Paris.
Obama told Sir David that children are 'much more environmentally aware' than adults, citing his daughters Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, as examples.
'They do not dispute, for example, the science around climate change,' Obama said in the clip.
Sir David agreed that adults lose the fascination with nature that is common among children.
He said: 'A five-year-old, turning over a stone and seeing a slug, says, "What a treasure!" Kids understand the natural world.'

	Christine Callaghan, 60, described the incredible moment when a bullet destined for her stomach ricocheted off her sunglasses case and hit her leg as she ran from a Tunisian terrorist.

According to some accounts, the terrorist also lobbed grenades at holidaymakers who became trapped in the corridor at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse.
Former RAF serviceman Mr Callaghan, 63, dived into a room with six other people and rammed desks and chairs against the door  before realising to his horror his wife of 40 years was not with him.
He told The Mail on Sunday: 'I looked around and Christine wasn't there. Then I could hear her screaming: 'Help me, I've been shot.''
With tears welling in his eyes, he added: 'At that moment I didn't know if she was going to die or not. I did think the very worst  that I was going to lose her.'
Mr Callaghan, who was himself suffering from a bullet wound to his right leg, nearly tore the barricade down to reach his wife but realised that doing so would endanger the others taking refuge in the room.
He said: 'You could hear the gunfire  we dared not open the door.'

Aftermath: Today staff at theImperial Marhaba Hotel were mopping up the blood which flowed from the victims of an ISIS gunman who opened fired on crowds of holidaymakers
Face of a killer: This is the man ISIS has claimed carried out the attack in Sousse - named by them asAbu Yahya Al Qayrawani
Predator: Assault rifle in hand, Regzui was pictured stalking the streets of the popular holiday resort town Sousse where he and possible accomplices killed at least 38 people
His wife, who works as a healthcare assistant at Cromer Hospital in Norfolk, said: 'I felt the bullet hit me and I went straight down. My right leg was bent across my body and the pain was incredible.
'The bullet went into my beach bag, smashing everything and ricocheted off my sunglasses case and out into my femur.
'I'm lucky to be alive  without the beach bag there, the bullet would have gone straight into my abdomen and my vital organs.'
Despite her horrific injuries  the 60-year-old grandmother's thigh bone was shattered by a bullet  she managed to comfort another British woman who was writhing in pain next to her with four bullet holes in her back.
She said: 'I just started calling for Tony, then I saw a woman next to me with four bullet wounds. I was in a lot of pain but the woman next to me was much worse. She was very calm and quiet  she was bleeding badly.
'I kept talking to her and holding her hand. She told me her name was Shirley. Her husband, who said he was called Joe, was there but he was beside himself and just panicking.' She said she had later heard Shirley was recovering.

The terrorist attack happened in the popular holiday destination of Sousse in the north of Tunisia
After Rezgui had moved on, and it was safe to venture out of the office, Mr Callaghan not only had to care for his injured wife, but also had to break the news to a young British man named Liam that the fiancee he had planned to marry in two weeks was dead from bullet wounds to her chest.
He said: 'There was blood everywhere. I bent down and kissed my wife and said: 'Everything will be OK.' She was crying. I looked over Shirley's injuries for a second and knew I needed to help her.
'I heard the sound of someone talking five yards down the corridor so I walked down and there was a young guy holding a woman. She was on her back and had been shot in the chest and stomach.'
Mr Callaghan said: 'He looked up at me and said: 'What can I do? It's my fiancee and we are getting married in two weeks' time'.
DESPERATE TWITTER SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS
Many families turned to Twitter last night pleading for news about their loved ones.
Sara Boyle tweeted: 'Ray and Angela Fisher missing in Sousse. Please retweet this  please help. Angela often called Angie.'
And Samuel Stocker wrote: 'Find John and Janet Stocker#Tunisia #SousseAttacks.'
The family of John Welch, 74, from Wiltshire and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70, said they had not spoken to them since Thursday.
Mr Welch's grandson Daniel Welch, 29, from Swindon, said: 'We can only expect the worst.'
Missing: Samuel Stocker wrote: 'Find John (right) and Janet (left) Stocker#Tunisia #SousseAttacks' - his mother and father
Heartbroken: Sara Boyle tweeted: 'Ray (top) and Angela Fisher (bottom) missing in Sousse. Please retweet this'
Disappeared: The family of John Welch (right), 74, from Wiltshire and his partner Eileen Swannack left), 70, said they had not spoken to them since Thursday
'He said she was getting cold and I bent down and checked her pulse. She was dead, I could tell. He said his name was Liam.
'I just said to him: 'Sorry, Liam, I can't find her pulse.' I didn't know what else to say. She was just a young girl. I had seen them arrive, they looked a lovely couple and very happy. It's just heart-breaking.'
Last night the Liam Mr Callaghan described was believed to be Liam Moore, who lost his fiancee Carly Lovett, 24, a photographer, beautician and fashion blogger from Lincolnshire, in the attack.
Mr and Mrs Callaghan's ordeal began when they were sitting around the pool at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel and heard gunshots from the beach 100 yards away.
Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Callaghan, who works for Norfolk police and lives with his wife in North Walsham, said many of the holidaymakers thought the noise was fireworks but because of his military training he recognised the ominous bangs and urged everyone to run for safety.
Silent: The beach would have been filled with tourists yesterday, but now it is taped off - with thousands of tourists now waiting to board emergency flights home after the horrendous attack
Contemplative: Tourists sit at the terrace of the Imperiale Marhaba hotel after a gunman opened fire at the beachside hotel in Sousse
Embrace: Scared tourists comfort one another at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel having survived the terrifying gun attack outside the beachside hotel
Once in the hotel, they were directed up a staircase to the left of the lobby by staff but they heard the gunman behind them and realised they were trapped.
Another couple, Ross Thompson, 21, and Rebecca Smith, 22, from Coventry, were treated for shrapnel wounds apparently caused by a grenade.
Miss Smith had injuries to her face, head, arms and legs, while Mr Thompson, a fire safety engineer, was lucky not to lose a toe. He said: 'The gunman was behind us, shooting. There was a puff of smoke and I felt shrapnel hit my foot.
'The adrenaline kept me going and we managed to get into an office off the corridor and barricade ourselves in. Becky hid under a desk.'
Miss Smith said: 'I've never been so scared in my whole life. You are on holiday relaxing  you just don't expect something like this to happen. It's terrible. I don't feel safe in this hospital. I just want to get out of here as soon as possible.'
Survivors:Rebecca Smith (top), 22, and her boyfriend Ross Thompson (bottom) came face to face with a Tunisian terroristwhen bungling hotel staff sent them fleeing down a dead-end corridor
Emergency: Dozens of British tourists are being treated at the Sahloul University Hospital in Tunisia
In a miraculous escape, Tom Richards, a university graduate who was on holiday with his mother and younger brother, found himself face-to-face with the terrorist in the hotel. Rezgui shot two people in the head, before turning his attention to Mr Richards.
The 22-year-old said: 'He looked right at me, I thought I was dead.'
But instead of shooting Mr Richards, he shot the floor  allowing Mr Richards and his mother, who were injured by shards of marble, to escape to a nearby toilet. 'I don't know why he stopped. He could have killed everybody,' he said.
Other injured Britons include Kirsty Murray, 25, from Braintree, Essex, who was being treated for four gunshot wounds to her wrists and legs after Rezgui opened fire as she relaxed by the pool.
Her fianc, Radley Ruszkiewicz, who turned 29 yesterday, suffered shrapnel wounds to his lower legs which he thinks were caused by a grenade thrown by the terrorist.
They were being treated at different hospitals in Sousse.
MISSING BRITONS CONFIRMED DEAD AS SONS PAY TRIBUTE ON TWITTER
Two Britons missing in Tunisia following the attacks yesterday have been confirmed dead.
Suzanne Davey, 44, and partner Scott Chalkley, 42, had been on holiday together in Sousse to celebrate buying their first house together when the shootings broke out.
Their sons Conor Fulford and Ross Naylor had spent all of yesterday frantically appealing on social media for information on the pair, but late last night confirmed they had both died.
Briton Suzanne Davey, 44 (left), and her partner Scott Chalkley, 42 (right), who were reported missing in Tunisia have been confirmed as dead, their sons have said
Paying tribute to mother Ms Davey on Twitter, Mr Fulford wrote: 'Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight.'
Mr Fulford began his frantic search for information after seeing what he believed to be his mother's body on a stretcher on Sky News.
His frantic appeals received thousands of retweets and shares online, as Tunisia's foreign minister said at least 15 Britons were among the dead.
Meanwhile, Mr Chalkley's son Ross was making similar appeals, before sending out a final tweet confirming that his father had been killed.
He wrote: 'Tonight, me and Brad lost our Dad, unfortunately he was caught up in the sickening attacks in Tunisia and is no longer with us.
'I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped, you have all been amazing. One love to all and rest in peace Dad.'

	BBC drama Poldark premieres in US and sparks Aidan Turner tweets

	Poldark made its US TV debut earlier this week - and the response to leading man Aidan Turner, 32, was just as lustful. Many viewers took to Twitter to share their love for the Irish star, 32.

'Damn, this Poldark guy is HAWT,' read one exuberant missive, while another, sent by Twitter user Jenn Nimthiriel read: '#Poldark was... amazing. #AidanTurner was beautiful, I don't get how he gets to be so perfect.'
One particularly enthusiastic fan even created a montage of the ways in which they found Poldark attractive, tweeting the result alongside a caption that read: 'Let us count the ways we found Ross Poldark hot on #PoldarkPBS... In a Tricorn, in a cloak, on a cliff, in a church!'
Another, Karla Nichelle, wrote: 'Omg finally sitting down and watching #Poldark... This man is SO fine. I'm sweating.'
Others found it difficult to choose between the Cornish countryside and Mr Turner for beauty, with one writing:
Counting the ways: One fan created a montage of moments in which they found Mr Turner attractive
Favourite show: Viewers also appeared to enjoy the romantic storyline
Who's more lovely? Some viewers couldn't decide whether they liked Cornwall or Mr Turner more
Sold! Others were clearly fans of the concept before they'd even seen the show
Hit! Mr Turner  clearly made an impression on Twitter user Erin Ruberry
'The #PoldarkPBS credits elegantly, economically establish the show's primary conflict: Which is prettier - Aidan Turner or Cornwall?'
Another came down firmly on the side of the landscape, tweeting: 'The scenery is beyond beautiful in this show. And yes, I did mean the landscape ;) #PoldarkPBS.'
Most, however, opted for Mr Turner. Social media user Erin Ruberry, clearly already a fan of a British drama, said:
'You had me at "British soldier", "Cornwall" and "true love" #PoldarkPBS. I am so in.'
Later, perhaps in response to the famous shirtless scything scene, she added: 'I'll just be here googling Aidan Turner GIFS if you need me. #PoldarkPBS'
Poldark has now proved a hit on both sides of the Atlantic and became the BBC's most popular drama of 2015 so far thanks to viewing figures that regularly topped seven million.
Smouldering: The famous scything scene worked its magic for the second time in the US
Popular: Irishman Mr Turner was once again the viewers' favourite
Local boy: Kyle Soller (Francis Poldark) hails fromConnecticut but wasn't as popular as Mr Turner
The finale, which aired on the 26th April, achieved 5.9 million viewers and an audience share of 25.4 per cent.
As a result, the show was swiftly recommissioned with filming for the second series due to commence at the end of August.
The series, based on Winston Grahams novels, follows Ross Poldark after he returns from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fiance, Elizabeth, has married another man.
There are 12 Poldark books in total, seven of which are set in the 18th century. The other five then follow Poldarks children through the 19th century.
The first series of Poldark, written by Debbie Horsfield, covers the first of Mr Grahams two novels, named after Ross Poldark and Demelza.
The second series will move on to the third and fourth books, named after their child, Jeremy, and scheming banker George Warleggan.

	London Mayor hopeful Ivan Massow and his VERY modern family

	Multi-millionaire Ivan Massow is living with the gay mother of his child and has a 20-year-old boyfriend. He hopes to be the Tory candidate for the Mayor of London elections.

He would have two mothers, but I saw myself helping out with nappy changing, playing football in the park, babysitting, going on holidays and being very much involved, Ivan says.
But just three months into the pregnancy, the women suddenly parted. Ivan wont reveal why the seemingly solid partnership floundered, saying only that its very sad.
The babys mother has declined all requests to comment and does not want to be interviewed. Which must be awkward for a man who has never been shy about discussing what he calls his chequered background  everything from male escorts, recreational drugs, alcoholism, depression and two suicide attempts. I believe in transparency, he says by way of explanation.
It is a refreshing, if potentially dangerous, trait for a budding politician. He has been teetotal since 2008, surrounding himself with other non-drinkers, and today lives quite frugally, flying easyJet, wearing M&amp;S shirts and giving thousands of pounds every month to charities and people he mentors.
During his colourful life, he has made a fortune, lost it and made it again. He was also sensationally fired as chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Art in 2002, after branding most conceptual art as pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat.
Living together: Ivan Massow shares his home with his gay life partner Mila who is expecting his child
Together: Ivan, pictured here with his 20-year-old boyfriend Harry Winter, could run for London Mayor
Ivan Massow is running to be the next Mayor of London (related)
It is his disarming honesty that makes him want to open up about everything. Nothing is sacred: from the time he stopped his father killing himself, to the homophobia some gay people direct at him, his abusive childhood and now his burning desire to become a father.
For although it is usually women who feel the tick of their biological clock, Ivan has long yearned to have a family. Its really important to me. I love kids and I have strong nurturing instincts, he says.
Having a child explains life. Without them, there is that thing missing. That need to provide and care. It will complete me in many ways.
Perhaps this desperate need stems from his own difficult childhood. When he was 12, his mother had to put him up for adoption after his father turned abusive. She had friends on the game; it was a different world, Ivan says uncritically.
When Ivan decided that he wanted to become a father, he researched adoption but felt his fame and chequered past counted against him.
He looked into finding a surrogate mother who would carry his child, and discovered a website that helps match up surrogates and sperm donors.
The procedure is a bit like online dating  only with higher stakes.
After two years of searching on the site, he found the perfect couple and they sent him their details.
Having a child explains life. Without them, there is that thing missing. That need to provide and care. It will complete me in many ways.
Several months later, after phone calls and emails, they met over coffee at the British Film Institute on Londons South Bank last year, but at that stage he was again holding out hope of adopting a child.
We seemed to fit very well, Ivan says. I told them I wanted to see how it turned out.
We remained in contact, then one day, when I realised I wasnt going to be able to go down the adoption route, I phoned them and said, Its time. Lets do it.
I was 46 and in my view time was running out because I didnt want to be too old for my child when hes in his late teens. The adoption process was taking so long. I didnt want to push it any further.
HE WAS particularly impressed that the couple were in a solid and secure 13-year relationship. They were so excited about having a child and they wanted the child to have a male role model in its life. They could have gone to a sperm donor clinic, but it was important for them to create something that was as close to being a traditional family unit, in their eyes, as possible.
The insemination  via a kit  worked immediately. It was amazing that we got lucky with the first attempt. I was absolutely delighted, gushed Ivan with masculine pride.
He is surprisingly happy with the domestic arrangement. When I first heard that they had parted, it was no question that I would do anything but say she had to come and live with me. Its going really well. Its nice.
Anyone might think that coping with a new baby is hard enough, without the added stress of two virtual strangers moving in together in a new relationship. But the five-bedroom mansion is more than large enough for mother and child to have their own floor  there is also a separate flat in the basement.
Still, it is an unusual set-up even in a world of increasingly flexible families. It seems very strange to be re-inventing the notion of an arranged marriage, muses Ivan. What we have is full of respect and kindness. We sit down and work out what would make life easier.
From what kind of school, to what food and how strict. Because when you have a proper relationship, these are the kinds of things you use to select your partner, based on your values. We are thrashing out what each other expects and being very polite, because we want to remain living together until the child is an adult. At least thats the plan.
Theyve even talked about how to conduct their personal relationship. Making sure that there is enough private space so that each can have independence, while at the same time ensuring that the child  and any others that might follow  feels it is a safe environment.
IVAN MASSOW SAYS JOAN COLLINS SAVED HIS LIFE IN ST TROPEZ
Multi-millionaire Ivan Massow has revealed the night that Joan Collins saved his life while he was staying at her villa in St Tropez.
The Dynasty stars intervention came seven years ago when Massow drank a staggering six bottles of wine.
She told him: I had just one glass last night. Nearly all the rest must have been you. I think you have a problem.
Massow, who has been teetotal for seven years, says: I wasnt a park bench drunk. Its about the light going out of your eyes and she was able to help me switch it back on. It was just before my 40th birthday.
He added: I get a lot of stick for my celebrity contact, but she has been a deep, deep personal mentor for 25 years and its just a coincidence that she is well-known.
Life-saver: Ivan Massow said Joan Collins saved his life after he drank six bottles of wine
Unlike Ivan, his son will want for nothing. He grew up with either foster carers or adopted family, leaving school with just one O-level, and ended up living in London at the age of 19. He started his financial consultancy business from a squat in Kentish Town, North London, at just 23. It arranged insurance for gay people during the worst days of Aids hysteria, when many faced inflated premiums.
It was wildly successful and by his 30s Ivan had four Bentleys, several houses and boats  along with a retinue of staff. Along the way, he also garnered a list of celebrity friends, from Geri Halliwell and George Michael to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. None is closer than Dame Joan Collins, who he calls his second mum. She has already been lined up as Nicos godmother.
Ivan also became a key Conservative Party supporter, accompanied Margaret Thatcher to the partys conference in 1999 and was an adviser to William Hague. Justice Secretary Michael Gove used to be a flatmate and he partied with a young George Osborne.
Which is why, until recently, he was considered the frontrunner to bag the Tory nomination to succeed Boris Johnson as Mayor of London next year. Until, that is, the partys favoured son Zac Goldsmith threw his hat into the ring three weeks ago. Ivans irritation at this last-minute competitor is palpable, but he refuses to indulge in political trash talking. Instead, he cheerily says: Weve known each other for 25 years. We go to dinner occasionally and we share lots of friends.
I dont want to judge him or his ability to resonate with Londoners. But I will say that I am troubled by the fact that more jobs, from acting through to the City, are moving away from Thatchers meritocratic revolution. Today, people from the right families are given the jobs because they have the right accents and went to the right schools. Thats not the world I want to live in.
Fatherhood, he says, feels all the sweeter because it has been a long time coming. I tried having a child with single women I knew, but it seemed as soon as I found someone they would find a partner and want to have a family with that person.
He has twice tried to adopt but found that his colourful history and high profile were obstacles. The agency was not just concerned about a potential relapse into drink and drugs, but also worried about his Google-count, as he calls it.
When Boris Johnson announced that he would not stand for re-election, I knew that I had to go for it and that it would blow my chances to adopt. Fortunately, the baby offer came up and it was a sure thing.
He might be in the grip of baby fever and so excited that its almost embarrassing, but he is determined that having a child wont get in the way of his bid to become London Mayor. Nothing will. Ive been preparing for the Conservative hustings for almost a year now. But I still turn up to all the scans and classes like an obedient spaniel. Im providing the home and I think its really important that my co-parent is able to control that end of things.
Ill be there for the birth, but standing from a certain angle, he laughs. Joan Collins thinks this new trend of fathers being so involved in the birth of a baby is vulgar  but she is very funny when she says it.
He has shut down all his businesses to focus on becoming Mayor. Money, he insists, has never really been his driver.
Im not your typical politician. I take the Tube, hate conventional politics and I love London. I came into this as a total outsider, but I would have been very disappointed with myself if I had not had the courage to stand. I think Im the partys best chance of a win. I know first hand what its like to have nothing and survive in this city.
If he fails in his bid, no doubt baby Nico will help to ease the pain.

	Rwandan spy chief Karenzi Karake freed from jail with help from Cherie Blair

	General Karenzi Karake, director-general of Rwanda's national intelligence agency, is accused of ordering massacres in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

Asked by Judge Purdy whether he would comply with the extradition proceedings, the general replied: 'I will co-operate.'
Prosecutor Aaron Watkins said the arrest warrant related to five alleged offences which carry a maximum prison sentence of 30 years.
'This is a defendant who has no ties in the UK,' Mr Watkins said.
'He is a Rwandan national whose presence in the UK was intended to be short term.'
Mrs Blair was seen arriving with the rest of Karake's legal team at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday
Mr Watkins said it was clear the Rwandan government 'did not accept the legitimacy of these proceedings'.
'It's perfectly plain their feelings towards these proceedings are outrage,' he added.
Mark Summers QC, defending Karake, said his client was 'a man of impeccable character' with a title in Rwanda comparable to the director of the CIA in America.
'He's not a rogue army officer,' he said. 'He's a senior member of a respected and democratic government.
'The context of these allegations is the government's battle to end the 1994 genocide.
Karake (pictured) was detained at Heathrow on Saturday on behalf of the Spanish authorities
'This is a private prosecution in Spain by private interest groups with links to those responsible for the underlying genocide.'
Mr Summers said Rwanda was not alone in its outrage about the indictment as the US had labelled it a 'bloated political tract'.
Karake's supporters began singing in the public gallery as he left the dock, while Rwanda's High Commissioner, Attorney General and the country's ambassador to Spain also sat in the well of the court.
Mrs Blair confirmed yesterday that Karake would not be immediately released from custody.
Speaking outside the courtroom, Johnston Busingye, Rwanda's minister for justice and attorney general, said: 'We did not expect General Karake would be arrested in the UK. When it happened we trusted we would make our case when the day comes in the court of law.'
Asked whether the arrest would affect Rwanda's relationship with the UK, he replied: 'Our relationship with the UK is bigger and longer and I would not want to narrow it.'
Karake's arrest on Saturday was condemned by Rwanda's High Commissioner in London, Williams Nkurunziza, as 'an insult', and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell claimed it was 'politically motivated'.
Mr Mitchell, who worked closely with the Rwandan government while a Cabinet minister, said the European arrest warrant system was being 'abused', with the allegations pursued by supporters of the old regime in Rwanda.
More than a dozen protesters waving placards in support of General Karake - who is nicknamed KK - gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing.
The placards included the messages 'Stop humiliating Africa,' 'freekarake' and 'UK, USA stand up against the Spanish indictment'.
Another placard read: 'Rwandan Community in the UK stand by our hero Lt Gen Karenzi Karake'.
One protester, who gave his name only as Peter, said: 'The embassy has its own official duties but we as Rwandans and compatriots of General KK are here to support him.'
A case management hearing will take place at the court on September 26 before a full extradition hearing on October 29 and 30.

	Prospective tenants looking at a luxury apartment in London soon to go on the market will find that it will be a matter of keeping up with the Windsors rather than the Joneses.

This might seem a lot but not when you consider Prince Charles official residence Clarence House is next door, while the Princess Royal, Princess Alexandra, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie have homes inside the palace.
In theory, anyone can apply but all prospective tenants will be subject to security and background checks, a palace source told The Mail on Sunday.
Neighbours inside the palace will include Princesses Eugenie (pictured left) and Beatrice (right)
Prince George was christened at icnoc St James' Palace
The apartment is the second one in recent months to go up for rent. Apartment 29B at St Jamess Palace went on the market last year.
The rent for this property is even more expensive as it is larger  it has five bedrooms and it is spread over four floors. Apartment 29A used to be occupied by the Ministry of Defence and prior to that it housed staff members of the Royal Household.
The unfurnished property is deceptively luxurious  it is set over two storeys with open fireplaces and a grand staircase.
With mounting bills to restore crumbling palaces, the Royal Household is keen to find income from renting out properties.
Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday suggest courtiers are also considering plans to rent out a third apartment at St Jamess, Apartment 30B.
The rental income from these dwellings is expected to help recoup the cost of essential renovations to St Jamess Palace. It will also boost the Monarchys rental income  which last year rose to 2.8 million.

St Jamess Palace, which is not open to the public, was built by Henry VIII in the 16th century.
The plans are all revealed in the Queens Annual Report, published last week. The document states: Every opportunity is taken to supplement the Sovereign Grant through growth in the number of properties available for commercial letting and reducing the number of vacant properties within the security cordon.
The Royal Household has a forward-looking plan that explores the scope to free up properties for commercial letting and identifies properties on the Estate which do not contribute to the Households operations. Three years ago  during the Queens Diamond Jubilee and London Olympics  the Palace allowed businesses to rent its Throne Room, Tapestry Room and Queen Anne Room.
The Queen allowed Perks Field at Kensington Palace to be hired by the Russian Olympic team during the 2012 London Games.
The Public Accounts Committee, which monitors expenditure in public life, has called on the Royal Household to save money.
Last year, there were questions over the spiralling cost of renovations to William and Kates apartment at Kensington Palace, which reached 4 million.

	Half of parents struggle with most Welsh and Northern Irish families facing money problems

	Campaigners called on the government to do more to stop families 'from falling into crisis', as a quarter of parents fear their children with have a worse life than them.

Parents aged 35-44 have the biggest money problems, with 51 per cent struggling financially.
Some 58 per cent of parents in both Wales and Northern Ireland report struggling to make ends meet, the highest in the UK, compared to 38 per cent in London and the East Midlands.
While more than a third of families are 'struggling' or just about 'surviving', only one in ten (12 per cent) would describe themselves as 'thriving' or 'doing really well'.
Parents of older children also seem to fare worse than those with younger families, and are more likely to be struggling.
Among parents with younger children, a quarter said childcare was one of the 'major challenges' in their daily lives.
Two in five parents say they have nothing left over at the end of the month after paying for essentials including food and bills.
It leaves many having to resort to credit cards, overdrafts and borrowing from friends and family to make ends meet.
Parents aged 35-44 have the biggest money problems, with 51 per cent struggling financially, the poll showed
The survey found that 24 per cent of parents think their children's standard of living will be worse than their own, rising to 40 per cent among the over-75s
It found that 24 per cent of parents think their children's standard of living will be worse than their own, rising to 40 per cent among the over-75s.
The poll comes as 4Children launches a new inquiry into family life in modern Britain today 'Britain's Families: Thriving or Surviving'- uncovering the challenges and opportunities facing families across the country.
Families across the country are on the edge, struggling financially and are finding it difficult to be optimistic about their children's futures
Imelda Redmond,4Children
Chief executive Imelda Redmond said: 'These results issue a triple warning  families across the country are on the edge, struggling financially and are finding it difficult to be optimistic about their children's futures.
'Government should listen to this warning and take action, because preventing families from falling into crisis is not only better for them, but far cheaper in the long run for the taxpayer too.'
It comes ahead of the Budget on July 8 when George Osborne is expected to impose deep cuts on tax credits, paid to people whose income from work is judged not enough to live on.
Ministers have demanded that firms pay their staff properly instead of relying on the benefit system to top up their workers' wages through tax credits.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the government wanted companies to 'take a fuller share of paying people a reasonable and decent salary' instead of relying on tax credits to top up their workers' wages. He said: 'We want companies to pay better salaries, which means less tax credits from us.'
One option being considered is said to be the idea of cutting child tax credit back to levels last seen in 2003, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates would save 5billion but would cost 3.7million low-income families an average of 1,400-a-year.

	Pete Doherty, three tragic deaths and one chilling connection

	They were young, talented and had their whole lives ahead of them, but Robyn Whitehead, Mark Blanco and Alan Wass all died before their time. Their connection? Infamous rock star Pete Doherty.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Now, however, he feels it is time to speak out.
Whitehead, who is writing a book which threatens to expose the seedy world of Doherty, accuses the rock star of breaking her down during the row that took place just hours before her death.
Pete Doherty and Alan Wass argued that she was not trying to tell the right story about Pete Doherty in the film she was making, he says.
They believed she would not tell the truth but Robyn stood her ground. She was an intelligent girl.
Robyn Whitehead, a glamorous heiress to the wealthy Goldsmith dynasty, died after taking heroin
She knew exactly what she was doing and then Wass came along, together with Doherty, that Saturday afternoon and attacked her mentally and broke her down.
A day after the confrontation with Doherty over the documentary, Robyn was found dead in a dingy flat belonging to one of his friends. Her father says: Robyn rang her mother after the row. She was terribly upset.
Whitehead says he had originally started the film project, but passed it on to his daughter.
He says: I had decided I was wasting my time and had better things to do. It was at that point that Robyn, who had been working with me, said Dad, let me finish it.
So unfortunately it was me who introduced Robyn to Pete Doherty on the basis that she would go on to finish my film. It is for me to remember that I introduced them.
While Whitehead starts work on a book about his daughter, another inquest is due to take place. Despite being one of his closest friends, Doherty is unlikely to appear at Westminster Coroners Court in two weeks time when the inquest into the death of Alan Wass begins.
Wass died two months ago of an apparent heart attack after severing an artery in his arm when he fell through a window.
For his mother, Angela, the grief of coming to terms with her only sons death is compounded by the fact that Alans reputation will forever be framed by Doherty.
Sitting on her sofa in her semi-detached home in North London, Angela looks at the ceramic urn in the front room containing her sons ashes. She says: They were friends before Doherty was famous and they carried on their friendship. Doherty was best man at Alans wedding. Alan was a true friend to him.
Alan had just signed a massive record deal. It was the break of his life. His career was taking off.
My son lived for music and he died for music.
Who would think that at 33 he would be dead? When I saw him in that coffin all I wanted him to do was to wake up.
I had made my will just a month before he died and the solicitors came back to me. They said you have not ticked the box in the event that your children pre-decease you and asked me what to do. I told them I did not need to do that because my children would not pre-decease me. Whoever thinks your child is going to die before you?
When I saw him in that coffin all I wanted to do was to wake up
Dohertys rise to fame, if not immediate fortune, began in 1997 with his band The Libertines. Wass played alongside him in the charismatic band whose eponymous album topped the charts in 2004.
Their cult reputation was sealed by Dohertys very public descent into drug addiction and dysfunction that eventually led to him serving time in prison.
At the height of their fame, Doherty was asked to leave the band and eventually the group disbanded, leaving Doherty free to focus on his next band Babyshambles.
His career and drug addiction tracked that of his close friend Amy Winehouse and Dohertys reputation was further enhanced by his tumultuous relationship with supermodel Kate Moss.
Moss and Doherty met in 2005 and their on-off affair only reached the end of the road in 2007, but by then Doherty had already become ensnared in a highly controversial death.
In May 2011, he was jailed for six months for possession of crack cocaine. The singers downfall was sealed by footage that had emerged showing him smoking crack with Robyn Whitehead and Alan Wass.
Two months after his conviction, Winehouse  the multi award-winning singer  died after losing her battle with alcohol.
A fan who modelled himself on Doherty also lost his life after a heroin overdose that year. One of those present at the flat on the night of Mark Blancos death was Johnny Headlock Jeannevol, once a close friend and security manager for Doherty.
After suffering from ill health for several years, Mr Jeannevol believes that he has turned the corner but only after cutting all ties with the controversial singer.
Pete Doherty presents his 'Hope Rehab Thailand Tour'
Alan Wass, pictured on his wedding day to Liza. Doherty was best man at the ceremony, and his mother said he was a 'true friend' to the singer, adding:My son lived for music and he died for music'
He said: I had to stay away from Pete for the sake of my health. It is stressful being with Pete and I had to calm down. I dont have his number any more. But I heard through friends that he was a bit gutted Alan had passed away and was a bit shaken up by it.
When asked why people around Doherty pay such a price, Mr Jeannevol cannot resist a well-worn phrase. He said: Its rock n roll, isnt it?
Mark Blancos mother is still battling with police to discover what really happened the night her son fell from a balcony to his death.
The CCTV footage recovered from the scene would subsequently become the focus of a long-running legal battle between his family and the Metropolitan Police.
An FBI-accredited expert believes that footage of the balcony seconds before Blanco fell proves incontrovertibly that there was another person with him  begging the question of whether he was pushed.
At the subsequent inquest it emerged that Blanco, who once worked for Goldman Sachs, had visited the flat of Paul Roundhill, a close friend of Doherty, in a bid to publicise a play Blanco was putting on.
Doherty had told an acquaintance to 'have a word' with Mark Blanco, and an inquest rejected suicide. But in an interview in 2012, Doherty claimed the police knew he was innocent, although admitted it 'does look dodgy'
Bizarrely the play, Accidental Death Of An Anarchist, features a character who dies after falling out of a window. Roundhill admitted that he had punched Blanco in the face several times.
It also emerged that Doherty had told an acquaintance to have a word with Blanco.
The inquest recorded an open verdict and rejected suicide. The corner called for a fresh investigation.
In an interview with the NME in 2012, Doherty claimed the police understood he was innocent.
The murder squad down at Limehouse, yeah, they opened and closed that case three or four times. The pressure they put on me was completely minimal.
And they kind of said off-tape Pete, were sorry about this, right, but the family are convinced that their son was murdered. I can understand it and it does look dodgy.
In two weeks time, Westminster Coroners Court will hear the inquest of Alan Wass.
A spokesman for Doherty said: The inquest into Alan Wass is pending and therefore it would clearly be inappropriate to comment. Peter Doherty fully co-operated with the police at all times in relation to Mark Blanco and there were no criminal implications for Peter Doherty at all.
On Friday night, Doherty was back on the stage when he performed a surprise gig at the Glastonbury festival.
Swigging from a bottle of beer, he dedicated the song Time For Heroes to his late bandmate, saying: Alan Wass, if youre up there looking down. Or down there looking up.
But Blancos mother Sheila, who is still waiting for a review of the evidence of her sons death, warns Alans parents that they shouldnt expect to hear any words of comfort from the star.
Sheila Blanco says: Doherty has never come forward to say anything about this case. Nor has he ever apologised to me.
He has never even spoken to me.

Critically-acclaimed American civil war movie Gone with the Wind is facing a backlash as the pressure mounts against symbols of the Confederacy.
The New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick has called for the movie to be banned from cinemas, while an artist who is tweeting the entire book has been uninvited to a number of literary events.
Gone with the Wind, first published by author Margaret Mitchell in 1936 before it was made into a film that won 10 Academy Awards, tells the story of the daughter of a plantation owner Scarlett O'Hara and her romantic entanglements.

Across the US politicians and activists have urged for the Confederate flag - which appears in the film - to be removed from public life, while memorials of historical figures from that period have been defaced following the Charleton shootings that left nine black people dead.
Now respected critic Mr Lumenick said Gone with the Wind, still the most successful film at the box office in US cinema, should be consigned to the history books as a racist depiction of the civil war.
'The more subtle racism of 'Gone with the Wind' is in some ways more insidious, going to great lengths to enshrine the myth that the Civil War wasn't fought over slavery - an institution the film unabashedly romanticizes', he wrote .
'But what does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the things as the Confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the Atlanta train station just before the 'GWTW' intermission?'

Former Minister Peter Lilley said the problem was so acute he would introduce a Bill into Parliament to force EU countries whose citizens default on their payments to make up the shortfall.
The Tory MP for Hitchin and Harpenden said: It is many millions of pounds and is one of the hidden costs of the European Union we need to rectify.
Under European law, students from the EU can apply for the same Government-backed loans as English students to complete courses in the UK  and more than 90,000 have now taken out loans. While English students automatically repay loans through the tax system, similar systems are not in place for those living in mainland Europe.
EU students are supposed to keep in touch with the Student Loans Company but many move addresses and bank accounts and cannot be traced. Although defaulters can be pursued through the courts, the cost of legal action is often more than the original debt.
Untraceable: Many EU students change addresses and bank accounts, meaning the Student Loans Company cannot find them

	Alison Pinnock, 47, believes it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed after 60 horrific accidents outside her home in Wickford, Essex, in the last five years.

'We've had cars in our garden, we've had trees falling down and it's almost like there's no point in having a fence.
'I can't go to sleep at night because I'm worried sick about what might happen. There are accidents on the road so often it's become normal.'
Alison, who has taken pictures of the most serious accidents, lives with husband Brian, 62, and her children Ryan, 21, Tyler, 18, Carley, 15 and Ellie, 12.
Mr Pinnock, who works as a maintenance driver for a hygiene company, bought the property 32 years ago but it's only in the past five years that the Pinnocks have had to deal with such a horrific string of car crashes.
A Ford KA and a motorbike were involved in a head-on collision outside the family home at 8.45am on May 25, this year
This Dairy lorry slewed off the road right outside the Pinnock's family home at 6am on February 13, 2013
At 5.15am on January 7 this year, a car slammed into the Pinnock's garden fence
The silver car spun off the road into the Pinnock's driveway at 7.30am on December 28, 2014
Mrs Pinnock told how she struggles to sleep at night due to the high number of accidents
'The authorities have told me that the speed on this stretch of road is appropriate but after logging so many accidents I have to disagree,' said Mrs Pinnock.
'Only a couple of weeks ago, Brian had just finished cleaning the windows to our living room when a car smashed through the fence right by him.
'He could have been seriously hurt or my children could have been out there playing - it's terrifying to think how close this accident was to hurting my loved ones.
'Something must be done about the speed now - we need protection.'
Tyler's room is on the ground floor of Mrs Pinnock's home and she lives in constant fear of a car veering off into the property while he is sleeping.
'I can't sleep at night - It's terrifying.
'I remember the head-on collision last year that happened in the middle of the night. We were woken up at midnight with a car and a taxi smashed up on our drive.
'There were police everywhere, two ambulances and a fire engine - they kept us up all night.
'It was absolutely horrible but it could have been so much worse, someone could have died.
'We have written to the council a number of times about the problems here because we want to see the speed limit reduced from 60mph to 40mph or even 30mph. There's absolutely no way that stretch of road should be a national speed limit.
'People are just driving along here too quickly - we are frightened it's a matter of time before someone is killed.'
At 3.20am on February 3, 2013 a car careered through the Pinnock's wooden fence,left. On May 25 this year, a motorcyclist was taken to hospital by air ambulance, right
Adam Pipe, casualty reduction manager for Essex Police, said: 'I spoke with Mrs Pinnock last week and we have offered to carry out a speed data survey over four days.
'The information can then be presented to Essex County Council, which is the highways authority, to determine the next course of action.
'Mrs Pinnock's home is beside a road within a 60mph national speed limit and at the bottom of a dip.
'A number of the historic collisions in which people have been seriously injured, took place during extremely cold winter weather, when water ran onto the road from nearby fields and froze.'

The Director of Public Prosecutions was facing calls to quit last night as her decision not to prosecute alleged paedophile Lord Janner was dramatically overturned.
The legal U-turn came just days after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the Labour peer had made secret visits to Parliament despite medics claiming he was too ill to be questioned by police.
Critics insisted Alison Saunders could not continue as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service when she had made such a catastrophic mistake over the high-profile case of the 86-year-old, who is accused of molesting boys in care.
Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was facing calls to quit last night as her decision not to prosecute alleged paedophile Lord Janner was dramatically overturned
She provoked fury among police chiefs when she ruled in April that Lord Janner could not be prosecuted because of his dementia, despite detectives collecting enough evidence to charge him with 22 offences against nine victims in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
Mrs Saunders, who earns 205,000 a year, strongly defended her decision  but an external QC was drafted in to reconsider the case after a challenge from alleged victims.
Last night it emerged the CPS has accepted the reviews decision to let the case be heard in court.

Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk  who declared in the Commons last week that Lord Janner had violated, raped and tortured children on school trips to Westminster  led the calls for the DPP to quit.
Mrs Saunders already faced pressure after the 20million failed prosecution of journalists over paying public officials, and the show trial of a doctor accused of female genital mutilation that ended with his acquittal in less than half an hour.
Mr Danczuk said last night: I think she should go. There was a lack of transparency over the decision, she had the case for more than a year, she made the decision when Parliament wasnt sitting and there were doubts about conflicts of interest over the advice.

Loader appalled at initial decision to not prosecute Janner
But more than that we need somebody at the head of the CPS who can not only make legal decisions but someone who also has emotional and political intelligence.
Shes been totally out of touch with public opinion on this and The Mail on Sunday was right to make this such a big issue, as weve had to drag our justice system kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.
Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk (pictured) led the calls for the DPP to quit
Liz Dux of law firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing many of the peers alleged victims, said: This would be total vindication of what my clients have been asking for all along ... they have wanted to give evidence for many years and now look forward to doing so.
Lord Janner will face a trial of the facts  a legal process used when suspects are deemed unfit to enter pleas, instruct lawyers or follow proceedings. A jury will hear the evidence against him and will decide if he did the facts, but there will be no verdict and no sanction.
In some trials of facts, judges can impose hospital orders if the public needs to be protected from a dangerous suspect, but Lord Janner is not considered to pose such a risk.
Daniel Janner, the peers son who is himself a QC, said the matter was now sub judice and he could not comment.
The unprecedented U-turn on a DPPs personal decision comes days after The Mail on Sunday revealed that Lord Janner used his Parliamentary car park pass, signed cheques and told clerks he was there on official business in June 2014  months after police had been told he was too ill to be interviewed.
It can also be revealed today that Lord Janner still has two laptop computers provided by the House of Lords, and reported his Blackberry lost last July, although he no longer has an office in Millbank.
A CPS spokesman said last night: We cannot confirm the outcome of the review until all of the parties have been informed.

	Carly Paoli, 26, has shared a Hollywood stage with actress Kate Hudson and boasts American Idol coach Paula Abdul among her fans. Not bad for a lorry driver’s daughter from Mansfield.

Her older brother Dean is a builder and her father Paul is a lorry driver who transports coal and ash in the Midlands.
Hes often covered in dust when he comes home, says Carly.

You may not yet have heard of Carly but in music circles she is being hailed as the next Katherine Jenkins
Mum makes him strip down to his underpants in the porch even if weve got visitors.
And though Carlys mum Tina is Italian and Carly is bilingual there were no opera buffs in the family. None of us have any idea where my passion has come from, she says.
But from as long ago as they can remember they just couldnt stop me singing.
At school, her teachers spotted her potential and suggested she have singing lessons, which she started when she was eight.
With her sights on the West End stage, she applied to the Arts Educational School in Hertfordshire, alma mater of Downton actresses Jessica Brown Findlay and Lily James, who was in her class.
After the school principal invited a guest from The Royal Northern College of Music to the end-of-year show, Carly was offered a place on the spot.
She graduated in vocal studies four years later, aged 23, and got a job teaching at her old dance school, supplementing her income with private performances at weddings and corporate events.
The latter brought her lucky break. Carlys voice  and no doubt her easy-on-the-eye looks  caught the attention of luxury Swiss watch company Bedat &amp; Co, who signed her up as a brand ambassador.

That association, in turn, brought her to the attention of the 16-time Grammy Award wining record producer David Foster who helped launched the careers of Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.
Last September, he asked Carly to perform at his glitzy charity gala in Calgary, Canada, where she shared the bill with Aerosmiths Steven Tyler.
Two months later, she was invited to perform at the International Womens Media Foundation awards, hosted by Hudson.
To crown her memorable year, she will take to the stage at the Teatro dellOpera Di Roma, where she will sing solo and with Cynthia Lawrence, the American soprano who was Pavarottis favourite female artist.
The comparisons to Katherine Jenkins are inevitable, but Carly says: Were actually quite different. I like to think I am creating a new sound and I hope when the public gets to know me theyll see that.
Either way, there is little doubt that if they dont know it already, music lovers will soon know her name very well indeed.

After 35 years of mangling the English language in his films, Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger has claimed that he can speak perfect English after all.
And he says he only sticks with his barely penetrable Austrian intonations because its what his fans expect.
Its now become such a big part of me, the accent, that people really enjoy it, explained the 67-year-old, whose latest movie Terminator Genisys opens in Britain on Thursday.

He said that he could speak unaccented English if I need to but added: The very things that they said would make it impossible for me to be successful in acting were the things that became my assets, referring to his name, his voice and his physique.

	Samuel Price and Elizabeth Sandlin weren't exactly a couple. They were a pair of attractive twentysomethings who, over the course of a year, met up now and again for sex with each other.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
In this modern age, a purely physical and non-emotional relationship like this is supposed to be a sophisticated answer to servicing basic needs.
Yet after a night together went wrong on Valentines Day last year, the failings in the practice defeated the advantages of the theory.
Price, 24, has been landed with a criminal conviction for assault after Sandlin, 20, complained to police about the roughness of the sex they had together.
On the night in question, they met up late in the evening after both had been drinking at separate functions: he at a wedding, she at a nightclub.
During sex in his bedroom at his familys luxury farmhouse outside Chester, Price had pulled Sandlins hair and bit her on the thigh and bottom, leaving bruises.
In his court defence, he said that rough and playful sex had always been part of their relationship.
He has apologised and was horrified when he saw photographs of her two bruises  but Sandlin was not to be placated.
I trusted someone I should not have trusted. He was very drunk, blind drunk. He completely overstepped the mark. I was shocked, she said.
Today, however, the one who is truly shocked is Samuel Price, who cannot believe he now has a conviction.
And, to be honest, neither can I.
Yet this case is part of a growing trend, just another unhappy statistic in a week when it was revealed that convictions for violence against women have reached a record high.
Domestic abuse cases account for 14 per cent of all prosecutions going through the courts.
Nearly 100,000 criminal cases were launched against abusive partners last year, with a record 68,601 successful convictions.
Of course, much of this is to be hugely welcomed. A broadening of the definition of domestic abuse to include offences such as revenge porn and coercive control is a step in the right direction.
Record numbers of men being prosecuted for violent crimes against women, including rape and so-called honour-based violence, can only be viewed as a positive step.
Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has urged police and prosecutors to take crimes against women more seriously, while changes in the law have made it easier to prosecute men for domestic abuse.
New guidelines encourage the system to be more open-minded and consider that victims of domestic abuse are not just the stereotypical battered wife.
They are women, perhaps, like Elizabeth Sandlin. Aggrieved after a night out went wrong and not ashamed to push for her partner to be punished.
Domestic abuse was once a dirty secret, a shame that had to be borne in private by a battered wife or a violated girlfriend.
Im glad those days have gone, but I worry that the mania for feminising the law  for whittling and shaping it to suit the concerns of noisy pressure groups  is resulting in skewing justice too far in the other direction.
In the Price/Sandlin case, if rough sex was an integral part of their relationship, then it must have been consensual.
Clearly on this particular night, matters went beyond what she expected or felt comfortable with, but he was in her words, blind drunk.
Perhaps she might have asked herself why she went to bed with someone who was so clearly out of control?
Prices judgment was blurred  but so was hers. However, while she can use drink as an excuse, he cannot, because drunkenness can never be a defence for violence, even if it was unintended.
Jan Moir says in the Price/Sandlin case, if rough sex was an integral part of their relationship, then it must have been consensual (pictured: Miss Sandlin's bruises)
Yet from the unpromising beginnings of an alcohol-fuelled tryst that went awry, Elizabeth Sandlin wasted no time in going on to try to criminalise her sex-pal and claim victim status for herself. My worry is that the DPP, while encouraging justice officials to look for victims in the unlikeliest places, is going to make it too easy for an aggrieved partner to take to the courts on a whim.
Meanwhile, pornography is readily available and books such as the Fifty Shades Of Grey quartet normalise sadistic sex to the extent that housewives hold S&amp;M-themed tea parties, complete with whip-shaped eclairs.
All this is confusing for young men and women  but especially for men.
Elizabeth Sandlin may have received justice for her bruises, but should this case ever have been brought?
Sensible women dont jump into bed with men for a sex assignation, then complain if they dont behave like Prince Charming.
Sensible women would develop a trusting relationship with a man before taking it to a more intimate level. But sense and perspective never seem to have a place in the sex wars.
Where are we going from here? Perhaps women will start to bring criminal charges if they dont get full sexual satisfaction on demand.

DECENCY IS DYING JUST A LITTLE MORE EVERY DAY
Sometimes the world seems to take two steps forward and then six steps back. It is the casual lack of humanity and common decency that is so killing. Like the heroin addict travellers who were invited for tea by a couple in their 90s, then proceeded to rob them as the wife was baking them scones.
In West London, a woman and her 16-year-old daughter committed suicide by holding hands and jumping in front of a train.
Horror in the rush-hour? Not quite. Some on the platform viewed the tragedy as not much more than an interesting distraction on their commute. Train staff had to broadcast repeated requests for passengers to stop photographing the bodies. Selfies, too? I dont doubt it.
Meanwhile, a former Sunday school teacher stole an antique toast rack from an Alzheimers sufferer and a coat from a partially blind lady while working as a carer.
Then two British schoolboys, supposedly on an educational trip to understand the horrors of World War II, were accused of stealing artefacts from Auschwitz. Perhaps they thought they could flog em on the internet?
What has happened to our morals? Pity we cant buy them on eBay, too.

Poor The Queen! On her tour of Germany, HM was presented with a painting that looked as if it had been produced by a ham-fisted mass murderer in a high-security art class.

The Queen left bewildered by stylised German painting
Is that supposed to be my father? she asked, peering at the picture titled Horse In Royal Blue.
No wonder she was confused, considering he had no ankles and appeared to be wearing a pair of plus-fours that had been blown up by bellows. No, I dont think its going to be hanging in the drawing room at Windsor any time soon.

BRADBY IS TV'S MR SMUG
In a U.S.-style shake-up of its flagship nightly news programme, ITV is turning the News At Ten into a star vehicle for smoothie-chops Tom Bradby.
The TV station bosses are labouring under the delusion that Bradby is incredibly popular with viewers, when perhaps the truth is that he is only incredibly popular with himself.
To be honest, I suspect most viewers find TB too glossy and self-satisfied in the brisk news environment.

In addition, he always looks as if he secretly dresses like Prince George when no one is looking. On the professional front, he is not as good a political editor as the BBCs Nick Robinson and hes not as good an anchorman as Mark Austin, whom he is replacing.
Meanwhile, ITV can expect stiff resistance to throwing showbiz razzmatazz at their news bulletins.
As far as British audiences are concerned, its all about the swirling currents, the stricken ship and what is looming on the horizon. It is never, ever about the anchor.

If you think eating bowls of cereal while driving in the middle lane is fine, dont move to Spain. A driver in Salamanca has been fined 60 for biting his nails. The man was caught by the Guardia Civil mid-morning and his fine notice states he was driving without maintaining proper freedom of movement because he was biting his nails while at the wheel.It is not known whether the driver intends to appeal  but who will be attracted to him, with his chewed fingernails, air of distraction and police record?

PUT HER IN QUARANTINE, JOHNNY
What is it with Amber Heard, the poor mans Scarlett Johansson? She is one of those annoying wives who take on the mantle of their husbands professional status, even when richly undeserved.
Indeed, marriage to Hollywood royalty Johnny Depp has made Amber behave like a preening queen of the screen, with a sense of entitlement way beyond her standing as the star of Drop Dead Sexy, Machete Kills and the new male stripper movie, Magic Mike XXL.
Le Grande Empress Amber has proclaimed that she and her husband will boycott Australia after a government minister threatened to have their dogs Pistol and Boo put down for flouting quarantine regulations.
I have a feeling were going to avoid the land Down Under from now on, just as much as we can, thanks to certain politicians there, simmered Amber.
What is it with Amber Heard, the poor mans Scarlett Johansson? She is one of those annoying wives who take on the mantle of their husbands professional status, even when richly undeserved
Poor Australia! An entire nation reels.
The couple were accused of unlawfully smuggling the dogs into Oz on a private plane last month, while Depp was filming the latest Pirates Of The Caribbean movie there.
Barnaby Joyce, an outspoken government minister, threatened to have the dogs killed, and declared there could not be another law for movie stars and their pets.
Australia has some of the strictest quarantine rules in the world  for a very good reason obvious to everyone except pampered movie stars. But Amber can only see the world in terms of the effect she is having on others.
Never mind the danger to the Australian ecosystem from her potentially germ-bomb teacup dogs, she blamed Mr Joyce for being a brute and trying to claim his 15 minutes of fame at her expense.
Johnny is saying nothing. Maybe he never even wanted to go back to Australia. But knowing the Aussies as we do, I doubt that either of them will be very welcome.

	Alexander Harrild faces possible five-year sentence in Chile for drug trafficking

	Alexander Harrild, 29, who attended the prestigious Dulwich College in London, has told police in Santiago that he will co-operate with them in order to secure a lesser jail sentence on drug trafficking charges.
      </Description>

In a court appearance the day after his arrest, he told the judge: I always liked to consume them [drugs] and basically when my business started going badly I didnt know what to do. I had to pay taxes and things, unexpected things, and somebody suggested I distribute drugs.
His new circumstances are a far cry from his upper-middle-class background in Britain as the son of the London Symphony Orchestras principle tuba player, Patrick Harrild, a former chairman of the orchestra and a long-serving member of its governing body.
He was also a professor at both the Royal Academy of Music  of which he was an honorary member  and Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
Patrick, 63, had been due to play with the LSO  regarded as one of the worlds best ensembles  at an open-air concert in Trafalgar Square last month but instead flew to Chile to be with his son after learning of his arrest.

Harrild, too, was a gifted musician. As a teenager, he played with the prestigious European Youth Orchestra and received extra tuition at the Purcell School in Hertfordshire, where many of Britains finest musicians are trained. He graduated from Dulwich College in London  whose old boys include Jeeves and Wooster creator PG Wodehouse, explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and Ukip leader Nigel Farage  in 2004, and five years later emigrated to start his new life in Chile.
Initially he boasted in online interviews that his food delivery business, called Comamos Algo  Lets Eat Something  was expanding. But when The Mail on Sunday visited the address listed on the companys website, it turned out to be a shuttered, seemingly derelict, building.
Chilean police laid out evidence, pictured, seized after they arrested Alexander Harrild for drug trafficking
In his first court appearance, on May 6, he blamed his drug-dealing on the failure of the business, which worked with 300 restaurants in the Santiago area. This newspaper has obtained a recording of his first court appearance in which he told the judge, in Spanish: I always liked to consume drugs and then basically when my business started going badly I had to pay bills.
I have a real job with a contract... I had a good job with a decent salary. My business didnt go well and I needed extra money.
He added, in English, that he then turned to dealing drugs over problems with his tax bill.
Harrild, pictured, emigrated to Chile to join the Santiago Philharmonic Orchestra
Deputy police commissioner Christian Vasque showed The Mail on Sunday pictures of the 16 grams of cocaine, 28 grams of marijuana and 50 ecstasy tablets they said they found in Harrilds possession, and read from the official 45-page police report into his case. At that initial court case, Harrild said that his wife, who comes from a distinguished military family, was not involved in his activities.
A police officer who interviewed Harrilds wife on the night of his arrest said she was distraught by the incident.
She was beside herself, he revealed. She said, How could I not have known this? I cant believe he did this s***?
He is my ex-husband after this episode. She was distraught and very upset.
Speaking to The Mail on Sunday last night, Maria shook her head and said of Alex: Hes a very stupid boy and added that he came from a very nice family.
The couple have been together for at least three years and several members of the Harrild family flew to Chile for their wedding in December.
Last night, a senior Santiago police officer, Hugo Haeger, underlined the seriousness of the charges  and how Harrild might get a reduced sentence if he were to name names.
He told The Mail on Sunday: He admitted to trafficking drugs immediately on his arrest. In cases like this it is common for someone to co-operate with prosecutors in order to identify those who are higher up the drug chain. They do this in order to receive a lesser sentence.
It is likely that he is co-operating with prosecutors and coming to some sort of deal. If he were to give information that led to the arrest of those who sold the drugs to him he could get a lighter sentence.
A source close to Harrild confirmed that he was hoping to strike a deal that would allow him to avoid a lengthy jail sentence, but instead have to report to a parole officer once a week  a deal that would forbid him from leaving Santiago.
He is currently being held in a section of Santiagos notorious 100-year-old Uno prison specially reserved for foreigners.
He is in there with murderers and rapists, Mr Haeger said. He will be sharing a cell for sure.
Harrild attended the prestigious 35,000-a-year Dulwich College pictured where he excelled at music
The jail is dangerously overcrowded  holding 1,500 more prisoners than the 2,500 it was built for a century ago  and last year was the scene of a vicious fight in which two inmates died. Days ago Harrild posted a photograph on Facebook, apparently taken inside his cell in which he bares his tattooed body, narrows his eyes and adopts a boxers stance. It is accompanied by the words: Feeling Optimistic, and in Spanish: Taste of freedom  it is coming soon.
On Facebook, Harrild calls himself Rocky Bal Bo, thought to be a reference to Rocky Balboa, the character Sylvester Stallone plays in the Rocky films.
At the prison last night scores of people waited outside the stark 50ft high barbed-wired topped walls to visit inmates.
Harrild used to live in a 750-a-month apartment in Santiago, pictured, along with his wife Maria
Street vendors selling hotdogs set up stalls to feed women and children waiting in line under the winter sun to visit prisoners. Harrilds new home is a far cry from the 750-a-month apartment he and Maria shared in an immaculate white, doorman-guarded block in the upmarket, leafy residential suburb of La Reina, popular with expats.
Harrild is not thought to have had any visitors inside prison apart from his father and lawyers. But he did receive a consular visit from a British diplomat at the police station the day after his arrest.
He is due to appear in court again next week.
This week he had been scheduled to play with the Santiago Philharmonic in a production of Puccinis opera Madame Butterfly at the landmark Municipal Theatre of Santiago  Chiles oldest theatre  and his name appears in the programme among the other horn players. A colleague from the orchestra who declined to give his name said: Weve all been told not to comment.
A woman who answered the door at the Harrilds six-bedroom gated home in Dulwich said the family did not wish to comment.

Another wrote on Facebook: 'All of the staff were surrounding them. Poor people must have been so desperate to do something like that.
'It was so scary they were sitting by a tree and the other one legged it out the school gates. It's really bad not feeling safe in your on school. He could have been anywhere. Glad to hear he's been caught'.
Police said today they had arrested the men on suspicion of illegal entry to the UK and they are currently in custody before being handed over to the Home Office.
Response: News of the incident, and the arrests, spread across social media locally, which led to eyewitness accounts from students and parents
Presdales is a girls secondary school and sixth form college, which was once attended by pop star Kim Wilde, Paul Gascoigne's daughter Bianca and former Eastenders' actress Kacey Ainsworth, who played Little Mo.
A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to Presdales School to reports three men were seen to emerge from a bus which had returned from France.
One of the men ran off whilst two others were detained by members of the public.
'Officers attended and searched the area and located the third man, all were arrested on suspicion of illegal entry to the UK.
'The men, who are 19, 23 and 28 years old, are believed to be from Sudan. The men remain in custody and the matter has been passed to immigration enforcement officials'.
It came just two days after two illegal migrants snuck into another  luggage compartment of a coach full of young children coming home from a school trip.
The pair were spotted crawling out from among suitcases as shocked parents came to collect their kids.

	How the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe got away with 23 'unsolved' murders

	In 1992 Peter Sutcliffe confessed to attacking two other victims during police interviews. Here, in an extract from Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders, its authors ask why more was not done.

The note also cites the catch-all health and safety, which under the Act means that the files contain information that could damage the physical or mental health of at least one person.
But there is another reason the Sutcliffe files remain locked in the vaults: the shameful cover-up that began in the months after his conviction.
A photofit produced by Tracy's description after she was attacked in 1975 (left) and an image produced after the attempted murder of one of the 'official' Ripper victims in 1977 (right)
Peter Sutcliffe was convicted in 1981 for murdering 13 women
The farcical proceedings at the Old Bailey  a fiasco that began with the Attorney General Sir Michael Havers first accepting Sutcliffes claims of insanity and then being forced to prove the precise opposite  ended on May 22, 1981. The same day, Colin Sampson, then assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police, began an internal inquiry into the failures of the Ripper inquiry. Simultaneously, Lawrence Byford, the local head of Her Majestys Inspectorate of Constabulary, began a separate investigation on the direct orders of Home Secretary William Whitelaw.
The parallel examinations were detailed and rigorous: Byfords team spent five months grilling senior detectives and junior officers alike. They were paid for by the public purse but both reports were kept secret, and some of their most important sections remain under lock and key today.
Sampson delivered his 200-page report to Chief Constable Ronald Gregory in October 1981. He concluded that if the force had not missed every clue that pointed to Sutcliffe, the deaths of his last six victims could have been prevented.
He blamed the forces chaotic filing system and the fact that Sutcliffe did not fit the profile drawn up after detectives wrongly became convinced that the Im Jack hoaxer (a man with a Sunderland accent who made a tape-recorded message and wrote taunting letters) was the real Yorkshire Ripper.
Faced with such a devastating condemnation, Gregory ordered the suppression of the report. But that wasnt the only reason. The key lay in two brief sections towards the end. We can reveal that one chapter, headed Other Similar Attacks, identified a number of similar unsolved attacks on local women dating back to 1966.
It said: Sutcliffe has now been interviewed about these and other cases which occurred elsewhere in the country, but has denied responsibility.
Killer's real face: The police mugshot of Peter Sutcliffe after he was finally arrested in 1981
This was an explosive revelation. After years of failing to link the Yorkshire Ripper to a succession of similar cases, West Yorkshire Police had now, apparently, rushed to ask Sutcliffe whether he would like to confess to them. Since detectives knew the Ripper confessed only to cases with which he had publicly been linked, the effort was  at best  naive.
Nor was the claim wholly truthful. In the months following Sutcliffes arrest, Detective Sergeant Desmond OBoyle had been pursuing a hunch on two unsolved local cases. The first was a brutal assault on taxi driver John Tomey, who had been attacked from behind with a ball-peen hammer in 1967. OBoyle spotted the similarity in modus operandi between the Tomey case and the proven Ripper attacks. He also noted that the detailed description Tomey had given closely matched Sutcliffe.
After interviewing Mr Tomey in the winter of 1981, the detective was convinced that he had uncovered another Ripper victim.
The other case was the unsolved murder of bookmaker Fred Craven in April 1966 in Bingley. He too had been bludgeoned from behind with a hammer. Again there was a good description of a man answering Sutcliffes description, and wearing a distinctive denim Donovan cap, as worn by the then famous Scottish pop singer. Sutcliffes 16-year-old brother Michael wore such a cap and was questioned for two days by police before being released.
Detectives failed to realise that another man at the same address was a better match: Peter Sutcliffe also owned a Donovan cap.
Immediately after Sutcliffes arrest in January 1981, Fred Cravens son, Ronald, rang the head of the Ripper Squad, George Oldfield, to ask whether his father could have been a victim. Oldfield had brusquely said he was too busy handling Sutcliffes confession to speak; he promised to call back  but never did.
OBoyle made a formal recommendation to his superiors that Sutcliffe should be interviewed about the Craven and Tomey cases.
His suggestion was rejected by Acting Assistant Chief Constable Jim Hobson, who insisted the Ripper only attacked women.
The second, potentially devastating, revelation in the Sampson Report was headed Description and Photofits of Suspects.
During the inquiry at least 77 photofit pictures and four artists impressions were compiled from descriptions given by witnesses and victims from a range of cases.
Here was evidence that the Ripper Squad had been given a large number of photofits from a succession of cases other than those for which Sutcliffe would be convicted. It begged the question of what had been done with them. We cannot know because they have never been released.
Outrage: Police hold back an incensed mob outside Dewsbury County Court during the trial of Peter Sutcliffe
HE CONFESSED TO ATTACKING THIS GIRL... SO WHY DID DETECTIVES NOT ACT?
Tracy Browne was just 14 when she was bludgeoned from behind while walking to her parents Yorkshire farmhouse in 1975.
She survived to give police a remarkably accurate description of Peter Sutcliffe.
Had detectives linked that attack to the first two official Ripper attacks that had happened just weeks before, Sutcliffes reign of terror could have been brought to an end then  six years before he was eventually arrested in 1981.
Peter Sutcliffe admitted the attack  and confessed to another  from inside Broadmoor High Security Hospital in 1992, but was never prosecuted for them.
Tracy Brownewas just 14 when she was bludgeoned from behind while walking to her parents Yorkshire farmhouse
The remit for the Byford investigation was wider. His team was tasked with drawing up a series of recommendations for future major murder inquiries.
Initially Byford believed that his findings should be made public. But something (or someone) appears to have changed his mind. The report, he later wrote, would now only be shown to those with a need to know. He added: I am aware of the inherent dangers the release of material from the report would involve for the morale of the West Yorkshire force as well as for the Home Secretary. Byford sent his report to the Home Office, which promptly locked it away.
Even when a Freedom of Information request winkled the document out of Whitehall in 2006, the report would be heavily redacted.
What was it that Byford had found that demanded such protection? Tucked away in his conclusions, Byford warned the Home Secretary: There is a curious and unexplained lull of Sutcliffes criminal activities and there is the possibility that he carried out other attacks on prostitutes and unaccompanied women during that period we feel it is highly improbable that the crimes in respect of which Sutcliffe has been charged and convicted are the only ones attributed to him.
This feeling is reinforced by examining the details of a number of assaults on women since 1969 which, in some ways, clearly fall into the established pattern of Sutcliffes overall modus operandi.
Savage: Sutcliffe was only ever convicted for 13 murders
It is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on women, which he has not admitted, not only in West Yorkshire and Manchester but also in other parts of the country.
Many attacks? Other parts of the country? Who were the victims?
In the wake of Sutcliffes failed appeal against his murder convictions in May 1982, police forces from across Britain queued up to interview the Ripper about unsolved attacks and killings in their areas.
Among them was Derbyshire Police which believed that Sutcliffe was the prime suspect for the murder of Barbara Mayo in October 1970.
She was a 24-year-old trainee teacher from London who disappeared while hitch-hiking up the M1 in 1970.
On October 18, six days after she was last seen, her body was discovered in woodland near Ault Hucknall, Derbyshire. She had been bludgeoned over the back of the head and garotted. DNA evidence, presumably semen, had been left at the scene.
All fit the MO of the Ripper, who regularly travelled to London at that time. True to form, West Yorkshire Police denied the Derbyshire force access to Sutcliffe.
While researching our book, we made a succession of FoI requests to police forces across the country, asked for access to Keith Hellawells list of 22 likely Ripper cases, and to the suppressed photofits identified by Colin Sampson and Lawrence Byford. We also asked the Home Office for access to the suppressed sections of the Byford Report.
In every case our requests were refused, usually on the grounds of confidentiality.
Whose privacy is being protected? The victims? Unlikely: in the murder cases, there remains no confidentiality to guard, and those who survived surely need justice and closure.
We came to a different conclusion. The evidence has been suppressed to spare the embarrassment so rightly predicted by Lawrence Byford of the various police forces and the Home Office.
But most of all, it has protected Peter Sutcliffe from answering for the full list of his grisly crimes.

The MoD said it backed the soldier and that members of the public should show respect towards guardsmen.
Clad in their distinctive red tunics and bearskins hats, the soldiers of the Queens Guard are charged with protecting official royal residences.
'Get back'! The guard yells at the man as he touches him, immediately wiping the grin off his face
Armed: The soldier - charged with protecting royal residencies - points his rifle at the man, who has already scarpered
Back to work: Ever the professional, the guardsman places his gun back on his shoulder and continues his march
The units, manned by fully-trained, serving soldiers, have more than 350 years of history and have defended monarchs since Charles II took the throne after the English Restoration in 1660.
There are thought to be guidelines in place for guardsmen to deal with nuisances, which begins with stamping their feet and shouting.
Raising a rifle is considered a 'final warning', after which the guardsmen is allowed to detain the person in question.
Earlier this month, another tourist was left embarrassed after a confrontation with the Queen's Guard.
Gerry Weatherhead, 58, a retired RAF engineer from Haverhill in Suffolk, was barged out of the path of a troop of marching guardsmen outside Buckingham Palace.

Hilarious moment Queen's Guards push 'stupid' tourist out the way
Oblivious to the soldiers, Mr Weatherhead was caught on video chatting to his wife as the men approached him at speed, shoving him out of the way as they marched through.
Following the collision the video shows the unconcerned soldier continuing to march while a loud military voice bellowed at Mr Weatherhead: 'Make way!'
A woman's voice can then be heard jeering: 'Stupid man!'
The video was shot during Trooping the Colour in central London to mark the Queen's official birthday.

	Zoe Appleyard-Ley on being violated by the live-in nanny who looted my life
      </title>

	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3141769/Violated-live-nanny-looted-life-chilling-warning-trusting-families-mother-cruelly-betrayed-duplicitous-thief-welcomed-home.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490
      </Link>
        <Description>
	Zoe Appleyard-Ley's former nanny, 45-year-old Emma Currie, was jailed for stealing £900 from her after vanishing in her car with a loot of her most prized possessions.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>1 silver spoon
1 suitcase
I started to make a hurried inventory of what was missing. A friend drew my attention to the emptied coat cupboard and it turned out that not just obvious things had gone missing. Can you remember everything in your house and where you left it?
It was only when I saw what was in the car when I collected it from Crawley police station, with no ID to prove I was me, that I understood the full extent of what had been taken. Places we had not even thought to look for missing items had clearly been targeted too.
That sense of cruel violation is something I hope few people will ever experience. However, as with any bad event, you get over it for your own sake and also for the sake of your children. You retain your belief in justice and want them to understand that justice does exist so you do everything you can to help the police in their investigation and of course you accept youll have to be a witness for the CPS.
Currie then jumped bail and went on the run, failing to turn up for her first court hearing. When she was finally caught and brought before a jury, I soon realised that a criminal trial can be even more traumatic than the crime itself.
Possessions can be replaced, but when someone sets out to destroy you publicly you are blind-sided. I was shocked that she could be capable of such cruelty. Suddenly everything was at stake.
I did not discover until the trial that, when Currie was arrested in my car near Gatwick Airport with my passport beside her, she had immediately started lying to cover her tracks. I was astounded to find out that the reason she gave for having been in Victoria Station was to deliver my dry cleaning to Jeeves of Belgravia. There is no Jeeves there and CCTV footage showed her without any dry cleaning.
Worse still, she exaggerated heinous lies she had told to social services in August 2013 and began to make up wild and unfounded allegations about me and my family. Until that moment, I had not realised that the British criminal justice system allowed criminals open season to ruin the lives of their victims by tarnishing their reputation and smearing their character without any effective right of reply.
If criminals are so inclined, they can stop at nothing, they can say anything they want. In court there are no holds barred. The oath to them means nothing. It does not matter that innocent and already violated children will be traumatised still further.
The things I was accused of were, to say the least, colourful.
As soon as I was called to the witness box, I realised that I was defenceless. I had no legal representation or say in what had been presented to the jury.
I was to answer only the questions I was asked and was unable even to whisper to friends the full facts. I had no forum in the witness box to state what really happened for fear of being held in contempt of court.
It did not seem to matter that Westminster Social Services had investigated Curries evil allegations and judged them to be false and malicious, or that their report was at the disposal of the prosecutor and had been submitted to the defence counsel from the outset  which, begrudgingly, she had to admit to the judge at the end of the trial.
Betrayed: Mrs Appleyard-Ley wants to share her experience in the hope of informing other parents
No one elects to be a victim of crime. You have no choice if you are summoned to appear as a witness for the CPS. But as a witness, your interests are not necessarily aligned with those of the CPS. It is not their job to defend you.
Indeed, collateral damage to the victim is of no interest to the CPS, even if they are hurt far more viciously in the pursuit of justice than in the original crime. Indeed, you do not actually realise that the prosecutor may have only been given the case that morning, and can even dismiss key witnesses not knowing what else they could independently verify.
THE 12 LESSONS I LEARNED...THE HARD WAY
1. Do rigorous background checks and insist on speaking to all previous employers.
2. Install video cameras in your house
3. Keep a credit card hidden, so you can get cash if your purse is stolen.
4. Be prepared for further violations upon your reputation in court, even if they are lies.
5. Make copious notes and put everything you can possibly think of in police statements. Keep copies.
6. Ask anyone who can corroborate your version of events to write detailed notes that include your reactions and make sure the police take statements.
7. Re-live the days before, during and immediately after the crime; think of everything, speak to people who were around you  they might remember something you dont.
8. Be prepared to be in shock at being in the same room as the criminal  I left the Old Bailey crying.
9. You will realise who your absolute best friends are
10. Try to keep your trauma away from your children
11. If you can, read out your Victim Impact Statement yourself. It will help in getting any restraining orders you might rightfully deserve.
12. It really is now time to move on and never mention this womans name again
Meanwhile the defence counsel will have been working in close collaboration with the criminal for weeks or even months.
I understand Currie went through three legal teams in two years. Unlike the criminal, the victim has been given no briefing or training for how to deal with the witness box experience (its awful), or expectation of what they may face in cross examination  however irrelevant to the charges under consideration.
Your inquisitors come across as cool and collected, you can look like a car-wreck.
Even worse, anything you may have said or done in your life may be twisted and used against you while the track record and previous bad character of the criminal must apparently be withheld from the jury  even if that includes, as it did in Curries case, jumping bail, going on the run from the police and apparently even performing a remarkably similar theft on a vulnerable elderly lady taking her car, heirlooms, silver and her beloved pet dog.
Until I appeared as a witness, I had never realised that victims of crime and witnesses are often treated worse in our courts than the criminals themselves.
The rules must be changed to stop criminals like Currie further abusing their victims while the court stands silent, as they do so. I have also come to believe that victims and witnesses should be given anonymity in cases where their private home and children are involved. At the very least, reporting restrictions should apply.
I hope my story will not discourage anyone from employing people to help them at home. Its often a matter of necessity, rather than choice. There must be thousands of people with small children or aged relatives who thank God daily for the help they receive from carers, house-helps, baby-sitters and nannies. For them, a world where you never let another person inside your home is not realistic.
However, my ordeal is a wake-up call that you need to be very careful about whom you place your trust in. Leave no stone unturned in your background checks. You need to know everything to make a proper evaluation of the risk.
And in my opinion the DBS check is not worth the paper it is written on (unless, of course, it actually shows a criminal conviction). Most thefts end up as a crime reference number, not a prosecution.
At one stage Curries barrister tried to get her a suspended sentence by blaming me for placing an inappropriate level of trust in her.
Until Emma-Jane Currie was finally convicted, I was in many ways the accused.

	Barrowford Primary bans teachers from raising their voices

	New-Age-style Barrowford Primary School in Lancashire, pictured,  has no rules at all and instead of play time, the teachers and pupils negotiate an appropriate period to take a break and eat lunch.

But it can be revealed today that Barrowford has an even more unusual approach to discipline. Unlike most schools, there is no behaviour policy, no lists of rules on the walls and, for the past four years, no sanctions at all.
Instead is unconditional positive regard  a term coined by American psychologist Carl Rogers which means accepting people as they are without judging them. Children have emotional literacy lessons where they are taught that there are no negative or positive emotions, just feelings to be acknowledged and understood.
School policy states: A child is not to be defined as naughty. It should be explained to the child that they have made a wrong choice.
Mrs Tomlinson admits that conflicts do arise but her staff are not allowed to shout at those involved. Teachers do not raise their voices as it is not respectful, but instead might point out that talking during a lesson has an impact on my emotional well-being.
No punishment: Headteacher Rachel Tomlinson says it is important that children see themselves as intrinsically good and build up a positive sense of self
See what life is like at 'inspirational school' Barrowford
They can ask children to go to another class, but to avoid causing any humiliation they are told to use the phrase: You know I think you are wonderful but your mistaken behaviour shows me that at this moment in time it would be best for you to have some time here, where these children can help you to stop making that mistake.
Even if a child is harmed, there is no punishment, but a restorative conferences designed to heal the damaged relationship.
Discipline is not the only unusual policy at the school. In 2012 it broke with the tradition of having playtime and lunch at fixed times. Instead the pupils and staff decide among themselves when to take a break. And in some weeks pupils are given hot chocolate and bacon butties for breakfast as part of Mrs Tomlinsons drive to create a comfortable environment.
The schools logo is a B designed to look like a heart and its slogan is learn to love, love to learn. They have a nurture room for pupils who cant sit in normal classes where instead they are helped to manage their feelings and cope better with school in whats described as a lovely environment.
No pupils have been suspended or expelled from Barrowford in the seven years that Mrs Tomlinson has been in charge, and it now takes on children who have been excluded from other schools.
She admits some parents struggled with the concepts at first, but says they are now supportive. In 2012, Ofsted rated the school good but noted that bullying is not dealt with effectively and some children get distracted when teachers do not provide the correct level of challenge for all pupils, issues Mrs Tomlinson insists have been tackled.
Last night Chris McGovern, a long-serving teacher and Ofsted inspector who runs the Campaign for Real Education, said: They are well intentioned but misguided  its a recipe for chaos.
Children need boundaries, they prefer clarity and they want to see punishment for the bullies.

'Jade's a lovely girl and she seems really happy with the house,' one neighbour, who did not want to be named, told The Sun .
Evans has described 'not being around enough' for Jade when she was a baby, claiming he was too focused on his career at the time to devote enough attention to his child and her mother.
Happy families: The BBC Radio host walked Jade down the aisle in 2013 after reuniting with his firstborn
Chequered past: Evans labelled himself 'selfish' in his treatment of Alison Ward, Jade's mother and his former fiancee (left). He moved on from the pair to marry Carole McGiffin in 1991 (right)
Alison Ward, Jade's mother and the DJ's former fiance, left him when she was still an infant.
Describing their parting in his autobiography, Evans said: 'Alison was totally selfless when it came to my ambition but I simply wasn't around enough to be supportive of her in the far more important task of bringing up a young child - in short, I was a selfish p****'.
'I came back to the house one day and Alison had had enough  she had gone back to her mums with the baby.
'What did I feel at the time? Im ashamed to say relief. I saw Alison going back home as leaving me free to carry on chasing my dreams, but thats where my head was at the time.'
The presenter and his former fiance became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute which was resolved in 1998, when Jade was 11, with Evans agreeing to a financial settlement.
Many loves: Evans went on to marry Billie Piper in a 200 Las Vegas ceremony. The pair divorced in 2007
He had, up until then, been paying maintenance to Ward, it was reported at the time.
Evans went on to marry former Loose Women star CaroleMcGiffin (they divorced in 1998, four years after separating and after seven years of marriage) before tying the knot with Billie Piper in a 200 Las Vegas ceremony in 2001.They divorced in 2007.
He married his third wife, Natasha Shishmanian, the same year. The pair have two sons together.
Third time lucky: Evans married Natasha Shishmanian in 2007. The couple (above in 2012) have two children together

Earlier this year Evans gushed over becoming a grandfather to Jade's son, Teddy.
Announcing the happy news to his millions of Twitter followers, he said in January: ''Teddy Rupert is here!!! Everyone doing brilliantly. Congrats to Ma &amp; Pa, Alison and Wardy, Sandra and Gavin ! (sic)'.

Documents obtained by the Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws show that 356 ex-politicians have obtained a Former Members Pass. It means they can entertain family guests in some of Westminsters bars and cafes which are closed to unescorted ordinary voters.
They include former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, still under investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog Kathryn Hudson over a cash-for-access sting which forced his suspension from the Labour Party in February.
Disgraced: Chris Huhne, pictured after winning his seat in 2010 before he was convicted of perverting the couse of justice in 2013, also owns a Former Members' Pass which allows him access to the Palace
An apprehensive Mr Huhne speaks ahead of prison sentence
Allowed: Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was also awarded a pass. He was suspended from Labour in February over the 'cash for access' scandal, and is still being investigated by a parliamentary watchdog
Another holder of the pass is former Tory minister Brooks Newmark. He quit the Commons this spring after sending an explicit photo of himself to an undercover reporter posing as a young female party activist.
Chris Huhne  who served a prison sentence in 2013 for perverting the course of justice  also holds a pass, as does former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith who was revealed in the 2009 expenses scandal to have billed taxpayers for the cost of two pay-per-view pornographic films watched by her husband.
The pass comes with strict instructions not to use it for lobbying on the premises and there is no suggestion any of the pass-holders have broken the rules.
But Edinburgh East MP Mr Sheppard said: As a new MP, I was genuinely surprised to see an awful lot of people that I thought had lost their seats wandering around and using the facilities.
It seems theres been a huge growth in the availability of these passes. There needs to be an inquiry into how this is managed and a procedure for former MPs to make a declaration of interests as current MPs have to do.

He also gave her four Oyster travel passes worth 10 each and a London 2012 badge. She later remarked: He definitely wasnt very romantic when it came to gifts.
She was left heartbroken when Sir Peter dumped her after his wife Sue, 60, found out about their fling.
Sir Peter declined to comment about the affair, except to deny spending any public money on Miss Grundy.
He recently famously branded Britains commuter trains awful and like the Wild West. Yesterday, as he was put in charge of Britains rail network, there were plenty of long-suffering commuters hoping he may hold the ticket to making their daily journeys more comfortable.
Sir Peter, pictured, refused to comment on the affair, only to confirm that no public money was used
Sir Peter wore a silk kimono while on the London underground in order to raise money for Comic Relief
Sir Peter, pictured, earns a taxpayer-funded salary of more than 650,000 and has a house in Bath
He has run Londons complex transport system since 2006. As Transport for Londons commissioner, he is credited with overseeing many improvements and his efforts resulted in a knighthood in 2013.
Sir Peter is familiar with the rail network outside the capital, too, having spent the past ten years travelling regularly between London and the 1.5million Georgian villa in Bath he shares with his wife, an HR consultant and the mother of his two children.
Unlike the squashed-in masses, however, the multi-millionaire enjoys free first class travel  a generous perk earned as a result of an earlier job as a London Transport manager. A colourful character, Sir Peter once took the Tube to work wearing slippers and an elaborate oriental silk dressing gown to help raise money for Comic Relief.
Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses at TfL total more than 650,000, is happy to emphasise his working-class credentials. He sometimes turned up to London Assembly meetings in a bus workers high-visibility jacket and loves to speak in a gravelly Cockney accent  to the amusement of his former classmates at a top public school, Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. And even though his father was a communist firebrand, his mother was the daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford.
The Honourable Mary Best ran away from her familys ancestral home in Dorset and married electrician Jack Hendy. A Communist Party activist and leading member of the Electrical Trades Union, he was caught up in a ballot-rigging scandal and, although cleared by the courts, was banned for life from the union. He studied for a law degree at night school and became a barrister.
Sir Peter has been keen to portray his career as a rags-to-riches rise from lowly London bus conductor to self-made millionaire and transport supremo.
But, having studied economics at Leeds University, he actually began in 1975 as a fast-track graduate trainee with London Transport, which involved a few weeks work experience as a conductor as well as learning how to drive a bus.
He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a 34million management buyout in 1995  and his stake was worth 4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for 54million.
Although appointed as commissioner by Red Ken Livingstone, a close ally, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson. At one point he concluded: Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken. He also noted: I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, Im not sure Im more Left-leaning than he is.
Did Tories cover up the rail crisis? Big projects halted weeks after party's election promises to spend billions on the network
By RAY MASSEY and DANIEL MARTIN
Ministers were accused of a pre-election cover-up last night after they announced bombshell plans to scale back rail improvements worth billions of pounds.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that rising costs and missed targets meant that the 38.5billion Network Rail modernisation plan  a centrepiece of the Tory manifesto only two months ago  was now untenable.
Two major electrification schemes in the North and the Midlands would be halted, he said, while wider spending plans would be amended after running out of control.
Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that the Network Rail modernisation plan was 'untenable'
Labour questioned why the chaotic climbdown had been unveiled now  just seven weeks after the election  when the pledge to spend billions improving the transport network had been a key part of the Conservative offer.
MPs also accused the Government of shelving bad news until after the election, even though they had known for months that the plans were at risk. One said Tory MPs across the North had been elected under false pretences. Conservative backbenchers were also angry that projects were being scaled back while the controversial 50billion HS2 high-speed rail scheme linking London and Birmingham  which they decry as a white elephant  survives unscathed.
The climbdown is a disaster for the Government and its pledge to deliver a northern powerhouse. The idea  championed by George Osborne  was for improved transport links to bind together the cities of the North, which would be granted devolved power to allow them to boost their economies.
The Conservatives election manifesto had pledged: We will transform our railway network. We will invest 38billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme.
The decision to pull the plug on rail schemes in the North and the Midlands, while keeping HS2 and London projects such as Crossrail untouched, puts the Tories rhetoric in doubt. Mr McLoughlin told the Commons that the five-year rail improvement plan needed to be reset because it was now costing more and taking longer. He said electrification work was being paused on the Midland main line between London and Sheffield  where hundreds of millions has already been spent on preparatory work  and on the trans-Pennine Leeds-Manchester route.
The aim is to keep Network Rails spending within its funding allowance, so that electrification of the Great Western line can be prioritised. Mr McLoughlin announced a shake-up of Network Rail management with the chairman  and former Ford boss  Richard Parry-Jones stepping down.
He will be replaced next month by Londons colourful transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy.
The 38.5bn plan is being shelved, while the proposed 50bn HS2, artists impression, will continue
It is understood that the London Crossrail project will also remain unscathed from the planned review
None of Network Rails executive directors will receive a bonus for the past year, Mr McLoughlin said. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne  who will keep his job  admitted they had been overly optimistic about meeting targets.
Labour said the Government knew the scale of the crisis before the election but sought to keep a lid on it to avoid damaging headlines.
In the Commons, Labour transport spokesman Michael Dugher told Mr McLoughlin: You spent the election campaign repeating promises you knew you would break. Ministers may try to shift all the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the Governments watch.
MP Clive Betts told Radio 4s PM programme: It has been becoming apparent over the past year that costs were going up and timescales were slipping, yet the Government kept this under wraps until after the election.
John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: This has been covered up for some time. There is a lot of anger that so many people have been misled by all this rubbish about the northern powerhouse. A lot of Tory MPs have been elected under false pretences.
Fly through the 42KM of Crossrail tunnels in this incredible...
Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: There have been clear signs since Christmas that Government is losing patience. And had it not been for a desire to avoid controversial headlines in the run-up to a General Election, the odds are that Network Rail would have been reformed by now in ways it may not have welcomed. There was suppressed Government fury at New Year, following the engineering embarrassments at Kings Cross and Paddington. But pre-election politics ensured a calm face.
Asked whether ministers knew before the election that the scheme was under threat, David Camerons official spokesman did not deny that this was the case. However, a Department of Transport spokesman said: Its not something the Secretary of State has kept hidden.
Tory backbenchers were angry that HS2 was not being cut. Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan said: I have always been worried that major projects such as HS2 would suck the life out of other areas.
If these projects are undeliverable now, what does that mean to the HS2 in a few years time. Will that become undeliverable too?
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: We have been promised time and time again that the money being pumped into HS2 would not affect the delivery of other infrastructure projects, but its clear that it is now cannibalising the rest of the railway budget and other upgrades with far more robust business plans are being shelved.
ALEX BRUMMER: After this shambles HS2 can now be no more than a dream
During the General Election campaign, we heard much from Chancellor George Osborne about building a Northern Powerhouse, and plans for exciting investment in Britains Victorian infrastructure  but little about how it would be delivered.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Greens were mocked for commitments to renationalise all or parts of Britains creaking rail network.
Now, the truth has been revealed. The running of Network Rail  which owns and operates our railways  has been a shambles, electrification of key routes is way behind schedule and is having to be postponed or even cancelled, and the Tory government is being forced to take direct control of the network.
Former Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, pictured, created Network Rail on a not-for-profit basis in 2001 and created an ungainly board including unions, passengers and green groups with weak governance
The Government has been forced to abandon the electrification of the TransPennine Express, pictured
Passengers were left stranded last Christmas when engineering works overran causing chaos
The largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times was at the heart of the Conservatives long-term plan to secure Britains economic future, to improve productivity and growth. That part of the plan now looks to be in serious trouble, and it is difficult to see how it can easily be rescued at a time when state spending is under pressure.
The real scandal is that the slide into chaos of the Governments promised 38.5billion investment programme must have been known to civil servants and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin before the country went to the polls on May 7, but not a word crossed anyones lips.
Instead, the nation was treated to a naively optimistic view of a nation determined to revitalise rail travel. Plans included electrification of the TransPennine Express running between Manchester, Leeds and York; improvements of the Midland mainline linking London and Sheffield, and most significantly of all, the vanity HS2 project  estimated to cost up to 42.5billion.
As a result of the new announcements by McLoughlin, several of the key projects are being paused and mothballed, and there must be real questions as to whether the highly contentious HS2 should be, or will be, undertaken.
The immediate trigger for the Governments shake-up of Network Rail is the mayhem that has been endured by passengers. This was symbolised by the engineering works at Kings Cross station that overran during the last Christmas break, forcing passengers of the East Coast, Thameslink &amp; Great Northern lines to use inadequate Finsbury Park station in North London, which became dangerously over-crowded.

There have to be real questions over whether the HS2, artists impression, will ever go ahead
The holiday season pandemonium is just a microcosm of what many rail travellers have to suffer every day, with standing room only, unexplained delays and replacement bus services, and fares that rise inexorably despite the big taxpayer subsidies.
At the root of these problems was the then Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers decision in 2001 to place Railtrack into administration and replace it with a not-for-profit new firm Network Rail, run by an ungainly board of members drawn from all sections of society, from the trades unions to passengers and green groups.
The bizarre structure made for weak governance, which saw rail chieftains rewarding themselves like captains of industry but failing miserably to deliver the services the public craved. Labour eventually had to pay compensation to the Railtrack shareholders.
The impossible governance structure allowed the top brass at Network Rail to enjoy riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Chief executive Mark Carne has a base salary of 675,000 and was forced to forgo a bonus of 135,000 for 2014 (a sum almost equal to the Prime Ministers pay of 142,500) after the Christmas chaos. He is just one of a bunch of Network Rail executives whose pay, bonuses and pensions hover around the 1million mark.
This is nothing compared to the pay of some of the operating companies, with David Brown of Go-Ahead group which runs London-Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, earning a shade under 2million.
One of the immediate results of the changes just unveiled is that finally, after years of dissatisfaction with the way in which Network Rail has been governed, the byzantine structure is being abolished forthwith.
Instead, there is to be rule from Whitehall, with the former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown being parachuted in as Special Director of Network Rail and reporting directly to the Transport Secretary. Brown will work alongside the colourful Sir Peter Hendy, the new Network Rail chairman, who is credited with running the London Underground on time during the Olympics.
What is absolutely clear from the changes and the review that has been unveiled is that under the chairmanship of Richard Parry-Jones, who is to step down, Network Rail lost control of the costs of one of the governments most high-profile infrastructure projects.
As chief executive, Mark Carne admits the projects which Network Rails been charged with delivering are going to take longer and cost more than we originally thought.
The Governments promise to spend 38.5 billion on railways over five years does not seem to be at risk. What will be affected is the ambition to create a 21st-century electrified rail system to empower the North of England and improve the links with the capital.
Whatever the outcome of the Governments review  it is promising decisions by the autumn  the imbroglio raises huge questions over the future of the HS2 project, connecting London to Manchester and running through some of Britains most unspoiled landscaped in the Chilterns; and HS3, designed to go East-West across the North of England connecting Manchester to Hull.
If the relatively simple task of modernising and electrifying some of the busiest rail links in the country cannot be achieved  despite a generous infrastructure budget  then the high-speed projects can be no more than a pipedream.
As for long-suffering commuters and business travellers, the pain of rail travel will continue.
Direct control from Whitehall may be an improvement on the old Network Rail, but it cannot be the right long-term solution. Until the private enterprise disciplines of cost controls, efficient engineering and delivery of projects on time are brought to the rail network, the taxpayer will not get value for money.

	Pre-wedding 'teatox' dieting craze using Bootea stops the Pill working

	Naomi Salt (pictured) unexpectedly fell pregnant after using the teatox. Herbal infusion Bootea can stop the Pill from working but angry users complained there was no warning on packaging.

Ms Salt said the online warning, which states that Bootea can affect the accuracy of the Pill if you take your pill in the morning within four hours of the laxative effect, is not prominent enough. She said: It is irresponsible, theyve got a duty of care to young women like myself. Bootea assumes people check the website but not everyone will.
Other women have taken to online forums to warn fellow dieters of the risk of becoming pregnant while taking Bootea, which is sold by Holland &amp; Barrett or direct online.
One woman wrote: At first it was great. I lost half a stone in two weeks! That great feeling didnt last long. Im now eight weeks pregnant with our third child, and after four weeks of shock it has finally sunk in and I have accepted this.
Another said: After having my little girl in 2014 I wanted to lose weight for the summer. I started Bootea and really liked it, I could see results and it tasted nice. Then I missed my period and thought it was strange as I was on the Pill. Now me and my hubby have a 13-month-old and Im two months pregnant.
No warning: People have complained the Bootea packaging carries no warning that the Pill will stop working
A third woman wrote: I had the same result! Dont get me wrong we are over the moon... But people should be made aware. Ive been on the Pill for almost 14 years! 28 days of Bootea... PREGNANT!
The programme involves drinking a herbal tea every morning with a separate infusion every other evening for 14 or 28 days. It is claimed that the teas will performed an intensive cleanse of the digestive system to help customers feel energised and motivated.
But the tea company, based in Cheshire, warns the bedtime cleanse may produce a laxative effect the following day.
Dr Sarah Hardman, deputy director of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare in London, said: The suggestion from the manufacturer is that the Pill is just being washed through your system too fast. You may not be absorbing your pill correctly and it may be the effectiveness of it is reduced.
The guidelines that come with the combined oral contraceptive pill say that if you have diarrhoea within four hours of taking it the effectiveness cannot be guaranteed, so you should be using additional precautions as well.
Ideally Bootea would mention this on the packaging, but if women are taking something that is not a prescribed medication then they have to take responsibility for looking at the potential risks.
Mail on Sunday health columnist Dr Ellie Cannon, agreed, saying: This is a failure of the counselling those women have had when they have been given the Pill rather than the failure of this tea.
Booteas online advice says that the tea can affect the accuracy of the Pill through its normal laxative properties  but that effects should NOT include diarrhoea.
The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Just four days after Russell Brand was told to F*** off back to Miliband as he prepared to address Left-wing protesters on an anti-austerity march, the self-styled revolutionary has upset Bob Geldofs daughter Fifi.
Fifi, whose sister Peaches died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 25, was a guest at a fundraising event this week for a charity that specialises in treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.
But Fifi was horrified when former addict Brand gave a speech in which he made jokes about drug abuse.

From what Ive experienced, a lot of people here tonight are on drugs right now, Brand told guests, who included recently knighted singer Sir Van Morrison, actress Sadie Frost and Madness frontman Suggs.
It was like an avalanche on the back of my toilet.
Peaches Geldof (pictured) died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 25
Referring to the charity Focus 12s founder Chip Somers, he told guests at the event at Londons Porchester Hall: Chip said, If you dont stop taking drugs in the next six months youll be dead, in a lunatic asylum or in prison. So I thought: Well, Ive got five months, three weeks and six days before I have to do anything, f*** that.
Fifi  whose mother, TV presenter Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose aged 41  was disgusted by the comments from the so-called comedian, saying: Less of a Russell Brand fan than ever after his offensive and highly inappropriate speech at the addiction charity event.
The 32-year-old PR executive, who was sporting a new upper-arm tattoo of a peach in honour of her sister, also pointed to a magazine article comparing Brand to the pompous would-be anarchist character Rick, played by the late Rik Mayall, in the Eighties sitcom The Young Ones.
Fifi added of Brand: Silly try- hard ****.
She also called him an 'unfunny b*****d' and an 'uber-douche extraordinaire'.
Last weekend Brand had to be held back in the VIP area of a rally against Government cuts as a group in Parliament Square screamed abuse at him because of his backing for Red Ed Milibands Labour Party at the General Election.
The hecklers called him a turncoat for telling fans to vote Labour while demanding an anti-capitalist revolution in Britain.
End of the affair for Google pair
It was the love affair that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley.
But two years after Google founder Sergey Brin sensationally left his wife for his young British lover, Amanda Rosenberg, the pair have now split.
Amanda Rosenberg (left) was accused of 'sleeping her way to the top' after it was revealed she was involved with Sergey Brin (right)
After moving to the U.S. after graduating from Leeds University, the Marlborough College-educated Rosenberg, 28  she was two years below Pippa Middleton  rose quickly through the ranks at Google: she was later accused online of sleeping her way to the top. She became close to Brin, 41, after working on the Google Glass project.
Their affair came to light when Brins wife of six years, Anne, discovered incriminating emails.
Rosenberg appears to have left Google and, according to her LinkedIn profile, now works for a software design company.
Meanwhile, it emerges Brin and Anne have quietly divorced. Their prenuptial agreement rules out any possibility of a fight over his 20 billion fortune.

The Queens starring role at London 2012s opening ceremony, in which a stunt double parachuted into the Olympic Stadium, has left a lasting impression. At a recent garden party at Buckingham Palace, the military band near the tea pavilion played a tune by Adele. The Rev John Wall, a guest, reports: I was tickled to note the theme from the Bond film, Skyfall.

Culture Secretary gets groovy thanks to his music buff son
John Whittingdales love of heavy metal is well known, but he also has an inside track on contemporary music trends.
John Whittingdale claims his son Henry keeps him in touch with all the latest music trends
The new Culture Secretarys son Henry is rising up the music industry ladder and holds a marketing position at Island Records, home to Glastonbury headliners Florence + The Machine as well as Mumford &amp; Sons and U.S. rapper Nicki Minaj.
Henry keeps me in touch with the latest music, admits Whittingdale, who hopes to attend Glastonbury next year after a diary clash prevented him attending this weekend.
Henry stays out of the political arena, but he did tweet after the May poll: Incredible result and one Im more than happy with, surely FPTP [first past the post] has to go now though . . .
Whittingdale senior, who will headbang to AC/DC at Wembley next weekend, might argue theres a little life left in the current voting system once the Tories secure boundary changes that would make their electoral position even more secure.
Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes has created a showbusiness dynasty. The Oscar-winners success has inspired his son Peregrine, 23, to follow him into the industry. He is now pursuing a career in film production, says Lord Fellowes, 65, who will give a talk at the Chalke Valley History Festival on Sunday about the world of Downton. I am proud of him, yes, and quite surprised  he hasnt had a day out of work since he left university. Thats quite extraordinary in our business.

	A number of sexual encounters and nude scenes in Swedish Akta Manniskor, pictured, don't appear in the British version Humans as the makers don't want it to be sexually exploitative.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Watch the dark trailer for new Channel 4 drama Humans
Big hit: It's the channel's highest rating show since 1992 but, uncharacteristically, it tones down the sexual content compared to it's Swedish counterpart
Just a kiss: This is another raunchy scene from the Swedish version of the show in which a man and a female robot kiss passionately
The Swedish version features several sexual encounters between humans and machines which will not feature in the remake, while scenes featuring nudity have been toned down.
There is no nudity in the British version, co-writer Sam Vincent told The Mail on Sunday. We do not want to be perceived as being exploitative.
6 million Channel 4 viewers saw lustful human teenager Toby try to touch the breasts of robot synth Anita, played by Gemma Chan
Last week, 6 million Channel 4 viewers saw lustful human teenager Toby try to touch the breasts of robot synth Anita, played by Gemma Chan. But she stopped him, declaring it inappropriate. However, in the Swedish version, Anita allows him to rub her intimately. In another scene from the original, a male cyborg touches his female owners breasts over the breakfast table before the couple are shown making love. This too is absent from the British version. And in another moment cut from the UK remake, the Swedish Anita removes her top and examines her breasts in a mirror.
Vincent added: Because we go deeper into the examination of sexual exploitation in our show we had to be very careful we were not going to be exploitative ourselves. That is why we didnt want to have a lot of nudity.
The new sensitivity marks a change of tone for Channel 4, which once revelled in shocking audiences with risque content, leading its former chief executive Michael Grade to be dubbed Britains pornographer in chief.
But Humans is not entirely chaste. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that an upcoming episode will feature a sexual encounter between a human and a synth.
Producer Chris Fry said: Its beautifully handled and at no point is it gratuitous. We wanted to explore the question of whether doing something like that with a synthetic is the same as doing it with a human being.
Humans, which is Channel 4s biggest ratings drama success since The Camomile Lawn in 1992, continues tonight at 9pm.

Novak's keen fan showed off her immaculately curled hair and designer dress as she stood to receive the T-shirt as he flung it in to the crowd.
And despite her pristine appearance she didn't hesitate to pull it on before grabbing Djokovic's face between two perfectly manicured hands and giving him a smacker.

Thrilled with her accomplishment, the brunette threw her hands up in delight as Djokovic moved away to carry on with the match

Of course, the player is happily married to model Jelena and the duo are enjoying their first year of marriage. 
But no doubt thoughts of being a domestic god are far from his mind in the run-up to the Grand Slam which kicks off on Monday.
The world No 1 has opted not to play in any of the official grass-court tournaments in the lead up to Wimbledon.
And as the favourite to triumph at the All-England club following the conclusion of The Boodles event, as he looks to retain his Wimbledon title and win for the third time in his career.
The 28-year-old has already won the Australian Open this year, but missed out on French Open glory, losing to Stan Wawrinka in four sets in the final.
Meanwhile, Richard Gasquet also gave fans a thrill by handing his sweaty shirt over to a well-dressed blonde sitting courtside.
He was also pulled into an intimate embrace by her.

	Zack Davies was found guilty of trying to kill Dr Sarandev Bhambra in front of shoppers at the Tesco supermarket in Mold, North Wales while shouting 'White Power' and 'I did it for Lee Rigby'.

'Dr Bhamdra sustained the most dreadful life-changing injuries during a sustained racist attack on an innocent man, a member of a caring profession here in Mold carrying out work for the benefit of the community, who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'
He also said many in the store and the emergency services had acted with courage that day but he singled out the actions of Mr Fuller for his 'quite astounding courage' and said he was considering how it should be best recognised.
Davies, pictured, was said to have been obsessed with Nazi ideology, with various associated literature found in a later police search of his home
He added: 'If it had not been for Peter Fuller there is every chance that Dr Bhandra would not be with us today, he would have been killed by this man. Mr Fullers courage is truly exceptional.
A knife, which was found by police belonging to Davies.Witnesses reported seeing a white man chasing an Asian man through the store with a knife and hammer
'It was a desperately sad and sorry case and the way Dr Bhandra coped and Mr Fuller behaved are just two rays of hope and light in an otherwise dreadful case.'
The jury heard how Davies would sit in his flat playing violent video games such as Call Of Duty on his XBox, sometimes for six or seven hours a day and watch online videos of ISIS beheadings.
Expelled from Mold Alun High School at 11 for taking a knife to school to attack a classmate, Davies became a loner and admitted carrying a knife with him every day since he was 15 because of his growing paranoia.
He harboured a hatred for his mothers boyfriend who he blamed for having to leave his mothers home and on January 14 he packed a machete, hammer and knife into his rucksack and went to attack Sion Williams, who worked at the towns post office in Earl Road.
When he failed to find him he sat for while before making his way through town where he caught site of Dr Bhambra near the bus station.
Prosecutor Sion ap Mihangel said Davies then followed Dr Bhambra to Tesco where he put down his rucksack, took out the hammer and machete and attacked him from behind with a hammer blow to the head shouting 'white power' and 'remember Lee Rigby'.
Terrified shoppers told how Davies then pursued the bleeding Dr Bhambra who fell several times as he slashed his skull to the bone and gashed his back with the machete and cut the nerves and tendons to his left hand as he tried to defend himself.
The court heard Dr Bhambra, of Leeds, told police: He would have hacked me to bits. I have no doubt in my mind that he was trying to kill me. I was singled out, I was attacked on the basis of my colour  I thought I was going to die.
Davies was described as a racist with a fascination for Far Right ideologies after police found Nazi-linked literature at his home. He also described Jihadi John as an inspiration
During a search of his home, police found various right wing literature and Davies was also said to be fascinated by ISIS
His ordeal ended when ex-soldier Mr Fuller bravely stepped into the path of Davies and told him he was ex-forces and to stop, because he was not solving anything.
He said 'we are under attack' but Mr Fuller said what he was doing was madness and Dr Bhandra was not guilty of anything.
As he was handcuffed and taken away by police, Davies told the gathered crowd that he had done it for murdered guardsman Lee Rigby.
Mr ap Mihangel described Davies as a racist with a fascination for Far Right ideologies and read everything from Koran passages, stickers for neo-Nazi group Combat 18to Hitlers Mein Kampf. In interview he had told police that may be the 'wrong' side had won the Second World War.
The attack happened at a Tesco store in North Wales, where Dr Bhambra had been shopping on his lunch break
He even said he had considered at one point converting to Islam because he was tired of his new flatmates and their drug-taking.
Davies, who Mr ap Mihangel said was intelligent and 'well read in his field', added he was interested in both extreme left and right wing ideologies and had been fascinated by ISIS and its 'no compromise' philosophy.
BRAVERY OF EX-SOLDIER WHO STOPPED ATTACK
The astounding courage of ex-soldier Peter Fuller almost certainly saved Dr Bhambras life, a judge said.
Mr Fuller told the court that he initially watched in shock as Davies rained multiple blows on the victim.
But as the dentist fled, Mr Fuller stood in Daviess way and shouted: Stop, this is madness. I am ex-forces.
He said Davies told him we are under attack. But the fact I said I was an ex-soldier, that I stood in his way, took the wind out of his sails, Mr Fuller added.
He persuaded the attacker to place his weapons on the floor and kept him talking until police arrived.
Judge Rowlands said: If it had not been for Peter Fuller there is every chance that Dr Bhambra would not be with us  Mr Fullers courage is truly exceptional.
The family of the victim said that they would be forever grateful to the ex-soldier.
He had taken a mask to wear during an attack on his mothers boyfriend and was planning to shout 'God Is Great' is Arabic while he did it.
He admitted he had selected Dr Bhambra solely because of the colour of his skin and Asian appearance.
In court Davies apologised to the family of Lee Rigby for dragging his name into the case and also to Dr Bhambra who he agreed was simply an innocent victim.
Just before he had left his flat, Mr ap Mihangel said Davies had looked at a website on the Koran and beheadings. But a search of his computer history also found extreme violent websites such as Best Gore and All the Gore.
Dr Bhambras brother, Dr Tarlochan Singh Bhambra made a statement outside Mold Crown Court following the guilty verdict against Davies.
He said: 'Sarandev was singled out because of the colour of his skin. We are in no doubt that had the racial disposition of this case been reversed this would be reported as an act of terror with a wider media coverage.
'We as a family have listened intently to the evidence and are in no doubt given the racial and political motivation that this should be rightly defined as an act of terrorism.
'By his own admission Zack Davies had extreme neo nazi views and is a member of a white supremacist organisation.
'Ethnic minorities have and continue to contribute positively to the multicultural Britain of 2015. Sikhs have sacrificed their lives in both world wars to facilitate the freedom that Britain enjoys today.'
After the verdict today, Dr Bhambra's brother Dr Tarlochan Bhambra made a statement on behalf of the family outside Mold Crown Court
Gareth Preston, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, added: 'Zackery Davies is a dangerous young man whose distorted and racist views led him to commit a terrifying act of violence.
'This was an attack against a complete stranger, singled out for no other reason than his ethnicity.
'Such was the level of violence involved that were it not for the extremely courageous actions of ex-serviceman Peter Fuller, this offence could have become an act of murder.
'As it is, Davies's actions have left Dr Bhambra with life-changing injuries. We hope that today's conviction will be of some comfort to him as he seeks to move forward with his life.'
One of his flatmates, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mail Davies believed Muslims should go back where they came from.

EXCLUSIVE: Are these bits of metal proof that Amelia Earhart died after being captured by the Japanese on remote Pacific atoll  and the U.S. government KNEW but covered it up?
Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan have not been heard of since July 1937 when they took off from New Guinea on 30th leg of round the world flight
But two investigators hope the mystery could be at an end within weeks
They believe they have two vital bits of evidence proving they landed in the Marshall Islands that day
If correct, it could prove they died while in the hands of the Japanese military - and that the U.S. government decided hero pilot was 'expendable'

Germany's central bank yesterday criticised the way Greek lenders are being propped up by emergency funds from Europe, in a sign that patience with Athens is wearing thin.
Greek banks have become increasingly dependent on a lifeline from the European Central Bank for survival as savers withdraw billions of euros from accounts.
But Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and an influential figure at the ECB, said this emergency help may breach EU law.

He followed that up saying that if there was no water available, they should consume their own urine.
The comments sparked outrage among parents who filed complaints against the teacher at the primary school in Sungai Petani, Malaysia.
The school was also attacked with a Molotov Cocktail which damaged the security booth.
Malaysian Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan (pictured greeting supporters at a by-election in 2010) reprimanded the teacher, but insisted that the remark was a joke
Two men have been arrested over the attack.
Malaysian Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan reprimanded the teacher, but insisted that the remark was a joke.
Deputy education minister, Mary Yap, a non-Muslim, has previously urged non-Muslim students to avoid eating and drinking in front of Muslim schoolmates during Ramadan, it was reported by PRI .
The education authority faced a backlash during Ramadan last year when a parent posted pictures online of her daughter and other non-Muslims being forced to eat in a shower room because thecanteen wasclosed.
Many canteens in Malaysian public institutions, including some public schools and universities, are shut during Ramadan despite there being large numbers of non-Muslim pupils.

A group of civilians stood and watched as the latest sickening murders took place.
One terrorist guarded the area standing on the back of a Toyota pickup truck armed with a heavy machine gun. 
However, despite the display of force by the terror group in their Raqqa stronghold, ISIS is being pushed back in areas such as Kobani, a vital border town between Syria and Turkey.
After they were murdered, the men were strung up on make-shift crosses along the roadside
Both men were dressed identically in red plastic protective suits when they were shot by the terrorists
U.S. and coalition forces have pounded 14 ISIS targets in Syria and a further seven in Iraq.
The terror group has been digging trenches around Raqqa as Kurdish forces close in on the strategically important town.
U.S. and coalition forces launched 14 air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and seven in Iraq on Friday, the U.S. military said, amid reports the militant group killed 145 civilians in the town of Kobani.
Four air strikes near Kobani, on the border with Turkey, hit three Islamic State tactical units and destroyed two boats, a fighting position and a vehicle, the Combined Joint Task Force said on Saturday.
Five air strikes near the militant stronghold of Raqqa destroyed five excavators, a vehicle and a remotely piloted aircraft. The task force said other strikes in Syria hit near Aleppo, Tal Abyad and Hasaka, where the militant group pressed a separate assault on Friday to capture government-held parts of the city.
In Iraq, the air strikes targeted militants near five cities: Baghdadi, Al Huwayjah, Baiji, Habbaniyah and Tal Afar. They destroyed buildings, weapons and vehicles and hit Islamic State tactical units, the task force said in a statement.

Hundreds of lawyers, social workers and counsellors are waiting to help. It wont cost you a penny. So play today. It could change your life for ever.

COME ON DOWN!
Get along to the airport. Get along to the lorry park. Get along to the ferry terminal. Dont stop in Germany or France. Go straight to Britain.
You are guaranteed to be one of tens of thousands of lucky winners in the softest game on Earth. Roll up, roll up my friends, for the game that never ends. Everyones a winner, when they play:
ASYLUM!
We keep being told that the current refugee crisis is a direct result of our involvement in the American-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and Britains meddling in foreign civil wars, such as the bombing of Libya.
But I wrote Asylum! in February 2000, a full 18 months before 9/11. In the U.S., George W. Bush wasnt even the official Republican candidate, let alone President. The Afghan and Iraq wars werent so much as a twinkle on the Pentagons radar. Back then, Tony Blair was too busy bombing the Balkans.
The Sangatte departure lounge opened as long ago as 1999, to accommodate immigrants trying to enter Britain illegally. There were riots at the camp in 2001 and 2002, before it was closed.
So please dont try to kid us that the mayhem at Calais is a new phenomenon. This all dates back to what Peter Mandelson called Labours deliberate decision to scour the world for migrants, so they could rub the Rights noses in diversity.
Once the Blair government made it plain that everyone was welcome, however they entered this country  and thanks to the newly-adopted Yuman Rites Act would never be sent home  its hardly surprising the world beat a path to our door.
Who can forget the sight of the then Home Secretary, Jolly Jack Straw, scuttling down to Dover to welcome in person a lorry load of immigrants from Sangatte, like an obsequious package holiday rep? He should have worn a red coat and a pair of white strides.
This madness was compounded by our membership of the EU, which meant that anyone who managed to set foot in Europe could make straight for the French coast bound for England.
Our island location and our opt-out from the Schengen open-borders treaty was never going to protect us. When our politicians were so keen to expand the EU to embrace former Communist countries in Eastern Europe, did they envisage that, say, Hungary, would become the first port of call for London-bound immigrants from Africa and the Middle East?
Of course they didnt. No one ever thinks anything through. Plenty of British politicians, including Winston Churchill wannabe Boris Johnson, are lobbying for Turkey to be admitted to the EU.
That would be Turkey, gateway to Islamic State. And, as we all know, gates swing both ways.
Already, known Islamist terrorists, hell-bent on attacking infidel targets in Europe, are stowing away among the migrants being picked up in the Mediterranean and deposited in Italy.
If Turkey gets full EU membership, the terrorists wont need to resort to subterfuge. Once theyve slipped over the porous Turkish/Syrian border, theyll be free to head for London.
Even after some Isis-sponsored nut-job has blown himself to Kingdom Come on the Underground, taking goodness knows how many innocents with him, the usual conga-line of hand-wringing Guardianistas will still be insisting that we have a humanitarian duty to take in all-comers, regardless of the consequences.
Sorry, but weve got enough home-grown head-cases ready to commit mass murder in the name of the religion of peace, without importing them from hell-holes in North Africa and beyond. And we know next to nothing about the people heading our way.
I dont dispute that some of these migrants are fleeing poverty and pretty grim living conditions at home. But that doesnt necessarily make them refugees. Most are economic migrants.
Earlier, I almost wrote about the world and his wife beating a path to our door. But his wife is conspicuous by her absence. So is his mother, his sister, his daughter.
At least 90 per cent of these 'asylum seekers' are young, able-bodied men in their late teens or early 20s
Dramatic moment migrant climbs into lorry cabin
At least 90 per cent of these asylum seekers are young, able-bodied men in their late teens/early 20s, wearing the latest designer sportswear. If they were genuinely in fear of their lives and fleeing real persecution, wouldnt they have brought their female relatives with them?
But no, its women and children last when it comes to crossing the Med. Were not talking the dance band on the Titanic here.
Of course, its racist to point any of this out. Which is why broadcasters and Left-wing journalists seize on any unfortunate woman with a child they manage to find among the overwhelmingly male multitude.
European leaders met yesterday to agree a common response to the crisis. Fat hope of that. Frances idea of a solution is shovelling all the migrants massed at Calais across the Channel.
And forget about international law, which demands that refugees apply for asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Europes open borders have made a nonsense of that requirement.
Typically, Britains response has been pathetic. Fining lorry drivers and sending a few more sniffer dogs isnt going to work.
Britain's response of sending a few sniffer dogs and fining lorry drivers has been quite pathetic
But what else should we expect? The Tories promised to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands, knowing full well that wasnt possible while we remain in the EU. Inevitably, immigration has gone not so much through the roof as through the ozone layer over the past few years.
Call Me Daves vainglorious interference in the Arab Spring didnt help. Remember him bombing Libya, without worrying what might come next, and doing a ridiculous lap of honour round Tahrir Square in Egypt? I told you at the time it would end in tears. The fall-out has landed on our doorstep.
Thats why immigration may well prove to be the trump card in the forthcoming EU referendum.
The only proper course of action to halt the invasion of Southern Europe  and by extension Britain  would be to close the EUs borders, which have as many holes as a string vest, and stage a full-scale Nato blockade of the North African coast to prevent any more boats leaving.
But that aint gonna happen, either. All weve done is send HMS Bulwark to act as a free cross-Med ferry. If thats the plan, why not get Bulwark  and that useless new aircraft-free aircraft carrier commissioned by Gordon Brown (HMS Prudence?)  to pick up migrants in Tripoli, bring them straight to Southampton and charge them for the privilege?
David Cameron lays out border control plans at PMQs
Toddington is one of the most popular drop-off points for migrants recently arrived from the continent
Theyre desperate enough to hand over a small fortune to people smugglers. So why dont we cut out the middle man? Theyre going to end up here anyway and the money might help offset the savage cuts in the defence budget.
Looking back on my Asylum! spoof, I notice that I mentioned the world-famous Toddington Service Area, in Bedfordshire.
Toddington is still one of the most popular drop-off points today. A local farmer this week revealed that he spends as much time rounding up illegal immigrants as tending his turnips.
You couldnt make it up.
Fifteen years ago, Asylum! was the worlds fastest-growing game show. Fifteen years from now itll be the longest-running. And those Afghan hijackers are still here, just as I predicted.
Roll up, roll up my friends, for the game that never ends . . .
COME ON DOWN!

Recovering: Joe Pugh was badly injured on The Smiler ride, but remains remarkably upbeat
Home for the first time since he was horrifically injured in the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash, teenager Joe Pugh, whose girlfriend lost a leg in the disaster, has revealed how the accident has brought the couple closer together.
Joe was on the front row of The Smiler ride with Leah Washington, 17, when it hit an empty carriage.
Leah has since had her left leg amputated above the knee. And last week it was revealed that 20-year-old dancer Vicky Balch, who was in the same carriage, has also lost a leg.
Both Joes knees were smashed in the June 2 crash and he faces months of physiotherapy. Yet speaking shortly after he had returned home, the textiles design student was remarkably upbeat.
He told The Mail on Sunday: Its amazing, but the accident really has brought the two of us even closer together.
We had mutual friends before, but in hospital her friends were coming to see me and mine would go and see her. Its become an ever-wider and closer circle of friends.
The young couple, who began dating in April, have been texting each other every day.
And last night I spoke to her on Facetime, beamed Joe, who is studying textile design at Huddersfield University.
Smitten: Joe's girlfriend Leah Washington has had to have her left leg amputated above the knee following the horror crash - but he revealed the pair are still together and the experience has brought them closer together
The 18-year-old was given a few minutes alone with Leah shortly before he left Royal Stoke University hospital on Monday. He had managed to see his girlfriend, who is still recovering from surgery, every day in hospital.
Last night, stretched out on the sofa at his bungalow home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Joe recalled the precious moments he spent with her before boarding an ambulance for the journey back across the Pennines.
I just said to her: Take care, Ill see you soon. It was all over in a few moments, but it was emotional for both of us.
Was there a farewell kiss as father Simon, 51, and mother Julie, 50, hovered? Not in front of the parents! Joe replied.

While negotiations for the new charter have not yet formally begun, a source close to the Governments plans told the newspaper that the abolition of the Trust in favour of Ofcom was more than likely, saying: You can put your mortgage on it.
The job of regulating the Corporation includes overseeing its editorial standards, reviewing value for money and monitoring its market impact.
The plans are thought to have the support of Chancellor George Osborne who has previously praised Ofcom for its work regulating commercial broadcasters.
Long battle ahead: Rona Fairhead will have a hard job fighting the plans which are believed to be backed by Chancellor George Osborne who previously praised Ofcom for its work regulating commercial broadcasters
The Green Paper will provide the starting point for discussions rather than concrete plans but it has been reported than a licence fee freeze is the best financial deal the BBC can hope for in the new charter. The idea has also been floated of reducing the length of each charter from ten years to five to allow the BBCs governing system to be more flexible and better able to cope with the shifting nature of the modern media landscape.
OSBORNE 'TO MAKE BBC PAY FOR FREE TV LICENCE FOR OVER-75S'
Chancellor George Osborne is considering making the BBC pay the 600m-a-year cost of free television licences for the over-75s, The Independent reports.
The newspaper claims that making the licence-fee payer rather than the taxpayer foot the bilkl for free tv for the elderly may be part of the Chancellor's new Budget.
Osborne is under pressure to make further cuts when he delivers the budget on July 8th, in order to fulfill the Tory election promise to cut the welfare budget by 12bn per year.
There are also alleged plans to scrap the law around the TV licence fee, which would stop it being a criminal offence not to pay it.
The BBC currently makes 200million-a-year by taking non-payers to court.
The BBC Trust had endured a rocky history since is was established less than a decade ago. It has come under fire for its role in excessive pay-offs to departing executives and the investigation into the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Its trustees have also been criticised for holding other senior jobs at the same time.
Mrs Fairhead faced calls to resign because of her role at HSBC after allegations of tax evasion at the bank came to light. Equally, the Trusts vice chairman Roger Carr faced pressure to leave because he was also chairman of arms firm BAE Systems.
A spokesman for the BBC Trust said last night: We fully expect regulation to be one of the issues debated as part of Charter Review.
The Trust is on the record as saying that the frontrunner would be to transfer the Trusts responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external (bespoke) regulator.
It was revealed earlier this month that the BBC spends less than half of its money on programmes for licence fee payers.
Only 2.4billion of its 5.1billion annual budget went on public service content in the year to April 2014.
A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: All aspects of the BBC are up for debate as part of the Charter Review.

	Ebola detected within MINUTES with new test device

	The device, which requires just a pinprick of blood, can be used at the bedside of patients and is as accurate as traditional lab tests that can take days, The Lancet reports.

A field trial of the test, developed by the US company Corgenix, took place at two treatment centres run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone.
A total of 106 patients suspected of having Ebola were given the fingerprick test and also had their blood analysed the normal way.
Every case of Ebola confirmed in the laboratory using the standard procedure was detected by the bedside test, with very few non-infected people wrongly testing positive.
However both tests failed to pick up a small number of Ebola cases that were identified by an alternative ultra-sensitive lab test which is not widely available.
The device works similarly to a home pregnancy test, with the sample applied to a treated strip. If the sample is positive for Ebola, a coloured line appears on the strip at a specific location
Dr Nira Pollock, from Boston Children's Hospital in the US, who led a trial of the test reported in The Lancet medical journal, said: 'Simplifying the process and speeding up diagnosis could have a major impact.'
The device was the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test developed by Corgenix.
The Public Health England lab at Port Loko in Sierra Leone, where clinical samples were routinely sent for standard molecular diagnostic testing, confirmed diagnosis.
Ebola epidemic 'lead to surge in malaria deaths'
Malaria likely killed many more people than usual in the West African nation of Guinea during last year's Ebola outbreak, a new study suggests.
This is because tens of thousands of people with potential signs of the mosquito-spread disease probably shunned health clinics.
The early symptoms of malaria - a fever and body aches - are similar to Ebola.
Health workers said many people with malaria were afraid of catching Ebola at a medical facility or being mistakenly sent to an Ebola clinic.
Experts based their conclusions in part on data such as how many people with malaria symptoms were seen at health clinics in four regions hardest hit by Ebola - and how many malaria medicines were given out.
They compared that to regions without Ebola and concluded there were about 74,000 probable malaria cases that went untreated.
Malaria is the leading killer of children in Guinea.
Malaria likely killed many more people than usual in the West African nation of Guinea during last year's Ebola outbreak, a new study suggests. Health workers said many people with malaria were afraid of catching Ebola at a medical facility or being mistakenly sent to an Ebola clinic
Since the Ebola outbreak was first identified in the forests of Guinea in March 2014, officials estimate the virus has killed more than 2,400 people in the country.
In 2013, about 15,000 people in Guinea were killed by malaria, according to Nets for Life Africa, a U.S. charity.
Mateusz Plucinski of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study, said it was difficult to say how many people among the 74,000 suspected cases might have died of malaria.
But he added it was probably 'substantially higher' than the number of Ebola deaths.
The research was paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative. It was published online Tuesday in the journal, Lancet Infectious Diseases.
In an email, Franco Pagnoni, of the World Health Organisation, said it was possible Ebola could have also caused spikes in malaria cases in the other countries heavily affected by Ebola - and this, in turn could have undermined previous efforts to curb malaria.
Health officials also worry the stress of the Ebola outbreak on Guinea's weak health system also resulted in a drop in vaccination coverage, putting the country at risk of a resurgence of diseases such as measles and polio.

	The 70-year-old and his Welsh wife split briefly in 2013 after his shock diagnosis with cancer but are now stronger than ever, Mr Douglas revealed in an interview with Event Magazine today.

Basic Instinct had just come out and I dont remember who the clever editor was in London, but they came up with sex addiction.
It became a new disease. No one had heard of that up until then, but its stuck with me ever since. And it still pops up now and again.
But he can smile about it now?
Oh yeah, my father is actually rather proud of it.
What, Meet my son, the sex addict?
Yes, just that! Dads a very funny guy, Douglas says of the 98-year-old Hollywood giant.
Hes witty. He has a new book of poetry out, some that he wrote and some poems that he loves, and the title is Life Could Be Verse.
Hes wonderful and he tells me hes proud of me. He didnt get a pat on the back from his father, so its lovely that hes able to tell me that.
Hes going to make it to his century, Im sure of that. It will be fantastic.
We had a little bump in the road. The problem in this business is that everything is so public. I love Catherine (Zeta-Jones) as much, more than I ever have. And hopefully the feelings mutual,' said Michael
It is hard to conceive that Michael Douglas, the fresh-faced love interest in TVs The Streets Of San Francisco, the pioneering young movie-maker who produced  and won an Oscar for  the ground-breaking One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest in 1975 (he was just 29 when production began on the film) will be 71 this year.
Its been quite a ride, he concedes with gentle understatement.
He is playfully proud of his impressive portfolio  a slew of modern mainstream hits including Wall Street, Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct, Disclosure, Falling Down and The Game plus the highly respected Wonder Boys and Behind The Candelabra.
As an actor, Douglas has cornered the market in bad guys, effortlessly making on-screen evil both believable and unbelievably attractive.
In short, he is Satan in a suit. His latest devilish creation emerges in Beyond The Reach, an independent cat-and-mouse thriller.
Produced by and starring Douglas, he plays an unhinged corporate shark pursuing a shirtless British actor (Jeremy Irvine) across the Mojave desert in a tooled-up six-wheeled Mercedes.
Squinting unforgivingly throughout while deftly delivering drop-dead one-liners, Douglas is in his element. Its good to be bad, he says, palms innocently upturned.
Also due for release next month is the superhero live-action movie Ant-Man, based on the Marvel comic, in which Douglas portrays Dr Hank Pym, a scientist who has invented a substance that allows humans to change in size. It promises to be shape-shifting fun. Yet it is comforting to know that bad boys are still Douglass bread and butter.
You have a much broader range as an actor when you dont have to worry about being socially and morally responsible, he explains.
After Wall Street was released people who came up to me out of business school  usually half drunk  would say, Oh man, youre the reason I got into this. And Id say, But I went to jail in the movie  I committed a crime! But they didnt care, they loved the style. The devils charming, the devils beautifully dressed.
I think for all young actresses who are beautiful, age is not the most welcoming part. But shes (Catherine) very comfortable with it and I think shes comfortable with who she is. Shes still stunning looking,' said Michael
For todays meeting, Douglas is stylishly attired in a hand-made duck-egg-blue shirt, tailored charcoal trousers and sleek black Oxford shoes.
All my clothes come from movies, he shrugs modestly. Thats the good thing about making so many contemporary pictures. Nice new suits.
In person, Douglas is a softer proposition than the driven, sexually malevolent characters he brings to life with such ease on screen.
I dont consider myself a sex symbol, he grimaces. Ive done sexual films but I dont think of myself as a poster boy. Im not a Kate Upton.
This is true. Douglas bares scant resemblance to the blonde American swimwear model.
Sex, as opposed to murdering someone, he continues, is something everybody can relate to, so everybodys a judge with sex.
'Everyone does it, so its hard to pull it off in movies. Violence is a little easier as its not something all of us easily identify with.
Douglas says that he has experienced the horrors of gun-related violence, as has the world in the subsequent light of the Charleston church shootings, which occurred shortly after this interview was conducted.
Like Events own Piers Morgan, Douglas is a passionate campaigner for handgun control in the U.S.
His personal issue with guns began in 1980 when he inadvertently found himself at the scene of John Lennons murder in New York.
We walked by the apartment when it was happening, he says, chillingly.
I was with Jann Wenner, who owns Rolling Stone magazine; my own apartment was one block away. We didnt know what was going on but we saw the commotion, then heard what had happened later.
And despite the high-profile world that he inhabits, Douglas maintains that he has never kept a gun for his personal protection.
Would he ever own a handgun?
Tearful Michael Douglas thanks Catherine and kids at awards
Carys and her mum are very tight, very close and theyre both very good dancers. Dylan plays the guitar  hes really into Talking Heads. And he and I are both scuba divers,' said Michael (pictured earlier this month)
If I havent by now, then I probably wont, he says carefully. Ive had a couple of times when it was close... but theres too much chance of an accident happening. I think a lot of the time guns in the house can cause more trouble than its worth.
There are big, big differences between the UK and the United States  in a country of 320 million people, we basically have a gun for every man, woman and child out there.
I understand hunting, I understand target shooting  I dont understand a need for automatic weapons, I dont understand a need for armour-piercing bullets.
'We have a farm up in Canada and my son Dylans got a BB gun that he likes. And it was certainly a part of my growing up with cowboys and Indians and holsters and guns.
Douglas had his own confrontation with mortality when, after three mis-diagnoses, he was diagnosed with tongue cancer in 2010.
I was Stage 4 and Id seen a lot of other people that I know go, he says sadly. It was pretty bad... but it got better. Then it even got good.
Having completed seven weeks of chemo and radiation treatment like the seven circles of hell, Douglas set about getting Behind The Candelabra, his unflinching portrait of flamboyant pianist Liberace, off the ground.
But then both [co-star] Matt [Damon] and [director] Steven [Soderbergh] said, youve got to put this off for a year, Douglas remembers.
I was thinking, This isnt going to happen. Realistically, I was not ready. My weight was way down and they knew that from looking at me. They knew wed have to wait for me to get stronger. I was very touched.
From a point where you think you may never work again, or speak again, I got probably one of the best parts Ive ever had. It played a key part in this renaissance thats happened for me.
The film, a brilliant study of celebrity loneliness, won universal acclaim and a best actor Emmy, US TVs highest honour, for Douglas.
It also featured several physically intimate scenes with Matt Damon which, as straight men but consummate professionals, neither actor found especially taxing. Has Douglas, I enquire, ever had a gay experience in real life?
Is Simon Cowell a nice fellow? Im doing this talk show with him tonight and Cowells a good guy, right? Michael asks (pictured with Jame Corden and Cowell on The Late Late Show)
No, I mean Ive had... he begins, then pulls up, laughing. Thats a personal question.
But an interesting one for a heterosexual sex symbol to answer. He nods, peering inscrutably into the middle distance.
I cant say I have, he says slowly. Certainly when youre really young  14, 15  there are situations you become aware of in terms of people making moves or something but... no.
He returns to Behind The Candelabras complex main character. Was Douglas happy with his portrayal of Liberace?
I was just happy to be alive, he says, shaking his head now. I was ecstatic. It feels like a rebirth after you go through cancer and you come out of it. You feel like youre a child.
'You see priorities differently. You have a much deeper appreciation of marriage, of your children  you see everything a little bit clearer, and a little brighter.
In a newspaper interview Douglas gave in 2013, there appeared to be some confusion as to how the actor had contracted the disease and  more bizarrely  his apparent claim that tongue cancer could be cured by giving oral sex to women.
What I was trying to say was that there is a sexually transmitted virus called HPC, Douglas says, in an attempt to clarify the controversy that ensued.
But there is a vaccination that they recommend to all kids before they become sexually active so they dont catch HPC, which is a cause of certain types of cancer  cervical cancer, tongue and throat.
So he didnt imply that performing oral sex could cure certain types of cancer?
No, he groans, anguished by the notion. I was trying to make a public service comment.
And presumably it caused a certain discomfort over the Douglas breakfast table. A telling flash of pain flickers across his features.
It was one of those things... and I so regretted any embarrassment that it caused Catherine, he winces, before adding: And her family.
Unrelated to this specific incident, Douglas and Zeta-Jones split temporarily in 2013, the stress of Douglass illness having been a factor in their separation.
Ill be quite frank, said Zeta-Jones speaking a year ago about her husbands condition and its effect on her. I was a mess.
In Beyond The Reach, produced by and starring Michael, he plays an unhinged corporate shark pursuing a shirtless British actor (Jeremy Irvine) across the Mojave desert in a tooled-up six-wheeled Mercedes
'It's good to be bad': Michael Douglas on playing villains
I tell Douglas that the couples recent reunion has been all over the media in the past few days. He contemptuously repeats the phrase all over the media in a mildly murderous, thoroughly Michael Douglas fashion.
But he quietly confirms that the couple are together again and singing, as the Welsh like to do, from the same hymn sheet.
We had a little bump in the road, he discloses, diplomatically. The problem in this business is that everything is so public.
I love Catherine as much, more than I ever have. And hopefully the feelings mutual.
'We worked things out  if both people want to work something out and make it better, you can do it. You cant do it if its just one person.
Pushed as to what he means by this, Douglas attempts to explain, then stops himself, aware that he may be creating a whole new breakfast table issue.
Look, he intones firmly, were about to have our 15th wedding anniversary and it feels great.
I ask Douglas if Zeta-Jones also felt professional pressure? Had age discrimination started to affect her as she went up for roles?
I think for all young actresses who are beautiful, age is not the most welcoming part, Douglas replies thoughtfully.
But shes very comfortable with it and I think shes comfortable with who she is. Shes still stunning looking.
Contradicting rumours of an ongoing rift in the relationship, Douglas speaks with deep affection about his wife  they share a birthday on September 25, albeit a quarter of a century apart  and talks warmly about her homeland.
Ive been to The Mumbles a number of times, he says. The Gower Peninsula is one of the most beautiful places Ive seen.
'They have a fair amount of rain  they could probably import that to California around now. But its a great community and I love playing golf over there. I cant do the accent, he apologises.
My wife laughs me off the planet when I try.
On Behind The Candelabra: From a point where you think you may never work again, or speak again, I got probably one of the best parts Ive ever had. It played a key part in this renaissance thats happened for me'
A unifying factor in their partnership has been the fact that Douglas and Zeta-Jones dote on their two young children, Dylan, 14, and Carys, 12.
And Douglas is uncharacteristically gushing in his praise for their emerging talents.
Carys and her mum are very tight, very close and theyre both very good dancers, he reports proudly.
I take Carys to dance and I take her to Broadway shows  thats something we share together.
'Dylan plays the guitar  hes really into Talking Heads. And he and I are both scuba divers, we just came back from Costa Rica. He went down a hundred feet  hes so good at it  and its just magical down there.
Life for Douglass eldest son Cameron, 36, whose mother Diandra Luker divorced Douglas in 2000, has been less enchanting.
Jailed for five years in 2010 on methamphetamine and cocaine dealing charges, he has had a traumatic time inside.
In 2012 Camerons leg was broken by another inmate and he has since committed drug infractions which have led to spells in solitary and an extended sentence. He may not be released till 2018.
I visit him and... Douglas takes a deep breath, hes holding up, for a guy who really got screwed.
Reverse celebrity, making an example, its been a nightmare. Hes been in much longer than he should be, but hopefully it will come to an end soon.
Its very hard but it has been an education and I look forward to jumping into this issue once I can get him out.
Has the experience coloured his ideas about inherited wealth? Will Douglas leave his children the $300 million he is said to be worth, or instead let them fend for themselves financially?
Considering how successful Ive been and the lifestyle that my children have had, it would be irresponsible of me to leave them with nothing, he asserts.
But were not into that European thing of all the money gets passed down to the oldest male.
And what does Douglas like to spend money on when in more selfish mode?
Hes wonderful and he tells me hes proud of me. He didnt get a pat on the back from his father, so its lovely that hes able to tell me that,' said Michael of his father Kirk (pictured in 1953)
I have a hot rod or two, he says. I was in the hot rod club when I was a kid. Thats something Jeff Beck and I have in common. Hes got a beautiful American hot rod collection in the UK  hes a real enthusiast and, oh my God, what a guitar player he is.
Remaining on a musical note, Douglas then segues seamlessly into a delightful showbusiness story  and one previously unaired outside of his immediate circle.
I was in the Bel Air Hotel on my way to the Golden Globes, he begins promisingly.
And there was George Harrison in the lobby. I was a huge fan so I went over and talked to him a little then went off to the awards. And I won, for Wall Street.
I got back to the hotel and everyone had gone. There was no one to celebrate with so I was feeling a little sorry for myself but I thought, Screw this and I ordered a bottle of champagne and a lot  a lot  of caviar.
Then at around 12.30am the phone rings and its [unspeakably poor Liverpudlian accent] Michael, this is George. Me and me mate have just got back and we wondered if we could come over and say hello?
Then theres a knock on my door and in comes George Harrison and behind him is... Bob Dylan. And he has with him the biggest dog I have ever seen in my life, a huge beast.
Dylan sits down but he doesnt say anything, so George and I are talking and the dog starts walking back and forth and then he spots the caviar and goes over to it and  slurp, slurp  he starts licking at the tin, shovelling it in, probably 200 bucks a lick.
Im thinking, Its Bob Dylans dog  Im not going to say anything.
'Finally, Dylan leans forward and he says [affects dazed drawl], Far out, he loves caviar. Im like  panicking, calculating the cost  Yeah, yeah, he sure loves caviar, Bob.
Douglas, who is a contemporary and devoted fan of Dylans, freely confesses to having been a hippie.
Kirk weightlifts his sons Joel (left) and Michael in 1955.Hes going to make it to his century, Im sure of that. It will be fantastic,' he said of the 98-year-old Hollywood giant
He lived the tie-dye dream in a commune known as Banana Road in Santa Barbara, where he grew his hair, rode a motorcycle and let his love flow like a mountain stream.
Banana Road was wonderful, he recalls mistily. One of the best choices I made was going to college in California in the early Sixties. I was still going to school, barely, but I was keeping out of Vietnam.
We used to have wine stomps and Dionysian festivals where wed wear sheets and do Greek comedy. Wed take the tubes from paper towels and make phalluses.
There must have been a lot of marijuana around.
Pot was certainly there, he deadpans knowingly. I dont think its ever gone away.
Despite his previous stint in rehab, Douglas still allows himself alcohol occasionally.
Oh, I drink in moderation, he says, flapping a hand dismissively.I dont get drunk, I monitor myself pretty well.
Before he heads off to The Late Late Show studio for a sobering encounter with James Cordens white thighs, Michael Douglas considers his own most gratifying achievements.
Professionally, the batting average over my entire career isnt bad. There have been a few good movies in each decade. Not too many clunkers.
Personally, I like to think that Im a good father, trying to be a good husband... He exhales softly before drifting into a more cosmic zone: a star contemplating the stars.
When you look up to the sky at night youd think we would be a little kinder to each other, Douglas says, his famous face folding into a rueful smile.
Because I havent heard of any other planet we can live on.
Beyond The Reach is out on July 31

Six of the Hollywood legends best movies... in his own words
1. One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest (1975)
I was 29 when I produced that picture. That was just the dream of all dreams. We did a lot of crazy things: like shoot it in a real mental hospital

2. Wall Street (1987)
Am I underrated as an actor? Well, I got an Oscar for acting in Wall Street, so I guess I cant say Im underrated

3. Fatal Attraction (1987)
In Fatal Attraction I have this affair with Glenn Close and then I get back to my apartment and I rumple all the sheets up to make it look like I slept in my bed and the audiences laughed. The producer Sherry Lansing said, My God, I cant believe it, theyve forgiven you already'

4. Basic Instinct (1992)
Sharon Stone was fabulous in that movie. Shes great. Did that scene steal the picture? Thats not something that would bother me. It was a very successful film

5. Falling Down (1993)
I love those quirky pictures with a sort of nervous laughter in them. I liked the character I played in Falling Down very much

6. Wonder Boys (2000)
I dont think it got the credit it deserved for everyone involved  it was a great movie

	Wimbledon bans fans from filming matches on their phones

	The new guidance has been introduced due to fears that filming could infringe Wimbledon’s broadcasting rights and aims to prevent sideline behaviour that may distract players.

But the introduction of apps such as Periscope, which allow mobile phone users to effectively broadcast live over the internet, has huge ramifications for sporting events  especially those that rely on striking lucrative broadcasting deals for exclusive coverage.
The US PGA Tour stripped golf blogger Stephanie Wei of her media credentials in May after she streamed live video of Masters tournament winner Jordan Spieth during a practice round at the World Golf Championship Match Play event.
STRAWBERRY RIPE FOR HEN-MAN!
Strawberries are a quintessential ingredient of Wimbledon  but this particular one might just fall fowl of the usual standards
The berry is shaped like a chicken, appearing to have a head, tail and even a nest when turned upside down. But Reuben and April Welch, who found the fruit at their farm in Bonnyrigg, Edinburgh, added a beak to complete the effect.
Surely its a dessert fit for former British tennis ace Tim Henman?
Alex Willis, head of digital and content at the All England Club, said tournament organisers would be using live video streaming in a very targeted way, to capture unique moments and give a unique insight into Wimbledon.
The club, in south-west London, has also banned selfie sticks  the metal rods that allow camera phones to be extended up to 3ft for group shots and panoramic images. They are listed under the prohibited items list on the Wimbledon website.
William Hanson, author of The Bluffers Guide To Etiquette, told the Daily Telegraph : Selfie sticks are ridiculous and are probably more a health and safety issue rather than a good taste issue, although you could argue the latter as well.
With any event of the social season there are certain rules and it puts some peoples backs up but if you dont like the rules then dont go to the event.
Meanwhile, Twitter has made a bespoke strawberry emoji  a tiny picture used to illustrate social messaging  for Wimbledon in tribute to the traditional strawberries and cream on sale.
Former tennis star Greg Rusedski has attacked the BBC over its decision to sideline John Inverdale during this years Wimbledon coverage. The 41-year-old branded it a mistake for the corporation to axe Inverdale, 57, from his 14-year run fronting the nightly round-up of the tournaments action.

As one of the first planes landed at Gatwick, Peter Long, joint chief executive of Tui Group, which runs Thomson and First Choice, said that he was 'deeply, deeply shocked' by the atrocity.
He added: 'Our whole organisation is reeling with pain to see the suffering that has taken place in Tunisia.
'The tragedy of the situation continues as we see families who have lost loved ones. Our heartfelt feelings go out towards them.'

Bereavement counsellors and trauma teams have been sent to Sousse to assist relatives of the dead and injured, the company said.
Yesterday Thomson and First Choice predicted they still had around 5,400 customers in the country.
Flights were landing throughout the day at Manchester, Gatwick, East Midlands, Leeds-Bradford and Doncaster airports.
But some holidaymakers almost missed the evacuation, unaware of the airlift until they saw other guests with suitcases in the hotel lobby.
Mr Long said: 'We had situations where people locked themselves in their rooms because they were so scared, which is understandable.'
A number of tourists were so worried about the possibility of another attack that they asked Tunisian police to accompany them to the airport.
A team of holiday reps was on hand to greet passengers as they entered the arrivals hall at Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 yesterday on the first flights from Enfidha, about 35 miles from Sousse.
Some were clearly distressed as they were led away by staff, with one middle-aged woman in tears.

Two ambulances waited outside the airport and a chaplain was on hand to comfort the returning families. Thomson and First Choice said all trips to Tunisia for the next week would be cancelled.
Another large tour company, Thomas Cook, said it was offering customers due to travel to Tunisia before July 5 the opportunity to cancel or change their holiday free of charge.
It sent two extra flights to the country yesterday, adding: 'We are committed to doing everything we can to support our customers who want to depart.'
Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, which has cancelled all flights and holidays to the region until July 5, added: 'Our absolute priority is to ensure the safe passage home of those customers wishing to travel as soon as possible.
'Aircraft are arriving now in Tunisia and will depart this evening.Passengers can rest assured that, as required, we will provide onward transport from Leeds Bradford and Manchester Airports.'
ABTA said there were an estimated 20,000 British package holidaymakers currently in Tunisia, plus an unknown number of independent travellers.
A spokesman said: 'The first priority is the welfare of holidaymakers in the hotels affected by this terrible incident, and extra flights have been put on to help people return home.'

It said holidaymakers elsewhere in Tunisia should contact their tour operator and follow any instructions issued by local authorities.
Meanwhile easyJet said it would provide an additional flight from Monastir, Tunisia, for customers wishing to fly home early.
Nearly 430,000 Britons visited Tunisia last year, according to ABTA.
The country's tourism chief, Hamda Abdelaoui, said the massacre was a 'catastrophe' for the industry and would lead to at least 1,000 Tunisians losing their jobs.
Last night it emerged that four UK emergency flights had taken off from Tunisia without any passengers on board, indicating that some visitors had decided to stay on after the attack.

	The real reason why the Queen can't move out of crumbling Buckingham Palace, RICHARD KAY writes

	Aides have warned that the Queen may have to move out of her London home so builders can carry out £150 million worth of refurbishment.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
This week aides warned the Queen may have to move out of her London home so builders can carry out 150 million worth of refurbishment. It was said the Palace, which has not been redecorated for more than 60 years, has fallen into such a state of disrepair that the wiring and plumbing will have to be replaced and the works could take up to ten years.
Against the reported 3.5 billion refurbishment estimate for the House of Commons and Palace of Westminster, the cost looks almost modest. Even so it has soared from a quote only two years ago, when officials predicted 50 million was needed to cover the maintenance for all the royal palaces.
At a time when many are still suffering the hardship of years of economic restraint it may not have been the best moment to ask for more taxpayers money. Certainly, the Queen was not amused that her state visit to Germany has been overshadowed by squabbling between her bean counters and the Scottish government over future funding for the monarchy north of the border.
She was particularly dismayed that Sir Alan Reid, her treasurer and keeper of the privy purse, of whom she is especially fond, found himself in the firing line over the matter.
Maintaining Buckingham Palace has always been a political hot potato. Only two years ago, MPs accused Sir Alan of shocking complacency over repairs to royal buildings when he appeared before a Commons committee. This was why Reid set out the 150 million refurbishment plan this week.
So is the Palace falling down? And if so, can the Queen possibly live there while refurbishment is taking place? There is no doubt work needs to be done. Staff have had to catch rainwater in buckets to protect works of art in the Queens Gallery and the Picture Gallery.
A chunk of masonry the size of a shoebox fell perilously close to Princess Annes car some years ago, forcing emergency repairs to re-face the interior of the quadrangle.
Work has been carried out to the clock face and pediment. Now, I am told, the balcony adjoining the Green Drawing Room, is structurally unsound and out of bounds.
Over the past year, the Palace has had to spend 300,000 on the removal of asbestos in the basement floor ducts, 700,000 on the resurfacing of roadways and paths in the garden, 800,000 on the renewal of slate and lead coverings and 300,000 on the refurbishment of the State Glass Pantry.
Five chandeliers in the Ball Supper Room have been taken down and cleaned by hand, a task that took an incredible two months. On a fact-finding visit, MPs reported cracked plasterwork and discoloured gilding on the staircase. The paintwork in the Blue Room was so faded it was more like a smoky grey room.
In a months time, the Queen will put the bickering behind her when she leaves the Palace for Scotland, where she will spend the summer and early autumn first at Craigowan Lodge and then Balmoral Castle.
After her departure the gates of the palace will be opened to the public at 35.50 a head. For two months visitors will tour the gilded state rooms where investitures, audiences and receptions are held.
A highlight will be the dining table in the ballroom, which will be set for 170 guests, with 2,000 pieces of cutlery, silver-gilt candelabra and tableware, and the Grand Service on which food is presented.
Dresses and jewellery worn by the Queen at state banquets over the years and gifts presented by some of the 110 visiting heads of state she has welcomed to the Palace will be on display. Visitors will also have a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the 12 months of preparation that goes into each state visit to Britain, including the selection of food and wine and Her Majestys outfits.
Ever since the doors were first opened to paying guests in 1993  in response to public outrage that the taxpayer alone should meet the cost of the devastating Windsor Castle fire  it has been one of Londons most popular attractions.
The Queen has been told that she may have to move out of Buckingham Palace for ten years
Members of the public can get the chance to tour Buckingham Palace while the queen is away for the summer
The public opening is also one of the reasons why the repairs have stacked up. In the old days before the Palace was opened for the summer, an annual maintenance programme was carried out, says a courtier. Now that cant be done in anything like the same way.
Few of the visitors will see anything but perfection on show. But behind the polished veneer of the official tour, all is not well.
All theyve been doing in recent times is papering over the cracks, says a courtier. The place is awash with asbestos, which is enormously costly to remove. The 150 million is just an estimate. After the Windsor fire we budgeted for 40 million and it came in at 37 million so you hope the estimate will come down.
This week, aides have talked about the Queen having to quit the Palace while renovations are carried out. This would mean having to find somewhere to hold state banquets, investitures and garden parties.
Other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who operate from the Palace, would also have to find another royal base.
The disruption means the Queen would be reluctant to move. There is also, I understand, a more emotional reason behind this reluctance. She is concerned that if she does leave she has no way of knowing when or whether she will ever return, says the courtier.
In particular, she is concerned Prince Philip might never return. She is not spelling it out but she is mindful of her own and Philips great age.
Another factor is the Queens attitude to money. Careful by nature, her first reaction to learning of damage or the need for repairs is to say: How much?
Buckingham Palace has been the Queen's home since she was ten - apart from three years after getting wed
Now 89, her habit of switching off electric lights in empty Palace rooms is well known. Apart from three years as a newlywed when she and Philip lived in Clarence House, Buckingham Palace has been her home since the age of ten.
While Edward VII called it a mausoleum and the Duke of Windsor likened it to a prison, Elizabeth happily took over the old rooms where she had seen her father at work. Many things have remained unchanged ever since.
After artist Michael Noakes was commissioned to paint the Queen, one of the first things she said to him when he arrived in the Yellow Drawing Room was that she really must do something about the curtains. Fabric swatches were ordered and the next time he came the samples were lying on the sofa.
Four years later when I went back to paint her again the samples were still there, he recalled.
And servants still talk, possibly apocryphally, of the story of the torn tapestry. The Queen is said to have noticed some damage to a wall covering and reported it to a footman. The servant took a pair of scissors to the tapestry, slicing off a strip to remove the offending tear. The Queen, I am told, never mentioned it again.
But while her bonds with Buckingham Palace are strong, it is not her favourite home. That is Windsor Castle where, as she gets older, she spends more time.
It is feared that the repairs to Buckingham Palace, pictured, could take at least ten years
Take a look inside Buckingham Palace with the Queen (related)
Her regular routine is to arrive at the Palace at 3pm on Monday and leave on Thursday afternoon. Usually it is for Windsor, but she and Philip also like the solitude of Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk for their weekend breaks. Because of the rhythm of the royal year  in which the Queen is at Sandringham for Christmas and the New Year, at Windsor for Easter, the horse show in May and Royal Ascot in June, and Balmoral in the summer  she spends less than six months at the Palace.
Not long ago some royal advisers were debating whether in these straitened times there was a case for mothballing one or two royal homes. Their thoughts were shaped by Prince Charles, who has let it be known that he thought Buckingham Palace should not be the home of the monarch.
Instead it should house royal offices and also be used as a magnificent venue for official entertaining.
But former royal aide Dickie Arbiter is firmly opposed to such an idea. Buckingham Palace is the symbolic head of monarchy, he says. You wouldnt expect the Pope to move out of the Vatican for a church round the corner. People come to the Palace for garden parties and investitures, and it is a great occasion which no other royal address quite possesses.
As for spending on the repairs, he says: Buckingham Palace is a building of historic importance, so the money has to be spent. Would you let the Tower of London fall down? Or the Palace of Westminster? Of course not.
The Duke of Windsor mournfully noted: One never tinkers with palaces; like museums they seem to resist change. A maxim that could not be more appropriate when applied to Buckingham Palace during the Queens reign.

	Hedgefunder Gregg Hymowitz has been slapped with a temporary restraining order by Manhattan Supreme Court halting work on the  bowling alley he had planned for his home.

The Manhattan Supreme Court has reportedly slapped Gregg Hymowitz, pictured, with a temporary restraining order
A wealthy hedgefunder is at the centre of a  row with his neighbour over plans for a bowling alley in his $23 million townhouse.
Gregg Hymowitz had been excavating the basement of his  Upper East Side home to make way for the new facility.
But Hemant and Varsha Shah claim the digging has damaging their neighbouring property, and say they are now facing a $5million bill for repairs.
A judge has reportedly slapped Hymowitz with a temporary restraining order, according to the Daily Post .
The ruling has stopped all work on the bowling alley until a full hearing can take place at Manhattan Supreme Court.
The Shah's $42 million home was built in 1903 for stockbroker Henry Goldschmid
In court papers they claim the work to Hymowitz's basement has caused the foundations of their 22 room home to shift.
They also alleged that it has caused their basement to fill with water and cracks to appear in the walls and floor of their home.
As a result the Shah's were said to have called in their own structural engineer to their 64th Street home.
It is alleged that the engineer noticed that the excavation of Hymowitz's basement appeared different to the plans submitted in 2013.
The Shah's had been planning to sell their century-old home, which features 10 fireplaces, but have now been forced to pull it off the market, according to the Daily Post.

Former British number one tennis player Greg Rusedski, who has attacked the BBC for sidelining John Inverdale in its Wimbledon coverage
Tennis ace Greg Rusedski has launched a surprise attack on the BBC over its decision to sideline John Inverdale during this years Wimbledon coverage.
The former BBC pundit, 41, branded it a mistake for the corporation to axe Inverdale, 57, from his 14-year run fronting the nightly round-up of the tournaments action.
Once ranked number one in Britain and number four in the world, Rusedski said the highlights programme wont be the same without Inverdales expertise and experience.
And he is reserving judgment on whether the BBCs new highlights show  with Clare Balding, 44, at the helm  will be a success.
Rusedski, who was speaking at the BNP Paribas Tennis Classic at the Hurlingham Club, said: I think John did a great job anchoring the BBCs nightly Wimbledon coverage and now that he has been removed from his role, it wont be the same without him.
Its unfortunate but I guess the people at the BBC want a different formula and Clare Balding is going to be doing her show.
It will be interesting to see how it goes and I just dont know until I see it  to see if it will work. But Clare did a fabulous job at Wimbledon and the rowing.
Once one of the most prominent figures at Wimbledon for the BBC, Inverdale has found himself increasingly sidelined following the furore over his sexist comments about Marion Bartoli during the 2013 tournament, when he told an interviewer: I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker.You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova.

Happy campers: Margaret Biggs, 77, and Joanne Croxford, 32, who are serving up tea and cake at Glastonbury
They make an unlikely pair of festival-goers  and an even more unlikely advertisement for the Womens Institute.
But great-grandmother Margaret Biggs and tattooed former drug addict Joanne Croxford are sharing a tent at Glastonbury as they attempt to shake off the WIs fusty image by serving tea and homemade cake to hungry revellers.
The organisation, traditionally better known for knitting, jam and Jerusalem, has set up a stall at the Somerset festival for the first time in a bid to recruit younger members.
For 77-year-old Mrs Biggs, who has been a WI member for 40 years, its an opportunity to sleep in a tent for the first time and sample her first Pot Noodle.
And for Miss Croxford, 32, its a chance to give something back to the organisation she says helped her recover from an addiction to drugs such as ecstasy  as well as inspiring some of her inkings.
She now has a number of tattoos based on the core values of the WI, including a teapot, gardening motifs and the wartime slogan of the institute, For home and country.
Miss Croxford, from Cambridge, said: This organisation really has been fundamental to my recovery. For the first time in my life I feel like I belong somewhere.
I fell into drugs when I moved to London aged 18. I took a lot of party drugs to fit in. Then I started working in the fashion industry and used drugs to lose weight.
Now Ive been clean for five years. A big part of that has been the WI. I joined when I lost both of my nans in quite quick succession and wanted to reconnect with that generation.
Now I would say 98 per cent of my friends are other members. Its a fantastic support network. Im friends with a 92-year-old and we have things in common.

The post went viral, spawning thousands of comments as social media seethed with debate about absent fathers and whether being a biological father automatically earns a man the right to be called dad.
Almost Famous actress Kate twisted the knife further by posting an intimate black and white photograph of herself alongside Goldies long-term love Kurt Russell saying: Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Fathers Day. I love you to the moon and back.
The offending tweet: Oliver Hudson posted this picture of his father Bill, and sister Kate on Father's Day

And as if to rub salt into Bills wounds, Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: Happy Fathers Day, Pa.
For Bill, the anguish slowly turned to anger as the headlines raged and his phone rang off the hook.
But he has maintained a dignified silence  until now.
In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill, veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to break all ties with his eldest children.
I say to them now, I set you free, he pronounced, his voice breaking. I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognise Oliver and Kate as my own.
I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name. They are no longer a part of my life. Olivers Instagram post was a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack. He is dead to me now. As is Kate. I am mourning their loss even though they are still walking this earth.

It is a sad denouement to a decades-long family saga which, Bill says, is more messed up and sad than any Hollywood screenplay could ever be.
For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldies claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings.
Last night, in a blistering attack on Goldie, Tinseltowns favourite ditzy blonde, Bill accused her of wilfully alienating him from their two children.
At the heart of the matter is what Bill calls the Hollywoodisation of Goldies story.
When we split up, she never had a bad word to say about me, he says. But when Kurt came on the scene, the narrative changed and I became the big, bad wolf. I would say to her Goldie, why are you trashing me and saying Im an absent father when its simply not the case? and shed laugh and go Oh Bill, you know it makes for a better story.
Eventually, Bill says, the fiction became fact as first Kate, now 36, and then Oliver, 38, drifted away from him and rejected his repeated pleas to remain part of their lives. He lays the blame at Goldies door. I believe the drip, drip, drip of poison which started when they were kids finally took hold, he says. Goldie wanted to create this myth of a perfect family with Kurt and she wanted me out.

Things came to a final showdown a week ago with Olivers bitter post.
That was like a dagger to the heart, says Bill as he sits in the sun-dappled courtyard of a hotel near his ranch home in Malibu, California. Its time for the truth to come out.
At 65, Bill still has the rugged good looks and easy charm that captivated Goldie when she was at the height of her fame. During their marriage, she became the highest-paid female star in the world thanks to quirky comedies such as Shampoo, Theres A Girl In My Soup and Private Benjamin. When the pair met in the first-class cabin of a New York to LA flight in 1975, Bill was a successful star in his own right with his group The Hudson Brothers, (the One Direction of our day, he quips). He had his own TV show and performed alongside The Beach Boys, The Osmonds and The Monkees.
The attraction was instant. I invited her out to dinner that night and that was it. The sex was mind-blowing. Even when everything else in the relationship turned sour, the sex was always amazing.
The pair wed in 1976 when Goldie was already pregnant with Oliver.
When their son was born at LAs Cedars-Sinai hospital, Oliver suffered from the life-threatening condition meconium aspiration, when a newborn accidentally inhales contaminated amniotic fluid.
Oliver was in isolation for three days, says Bill. Goldie and I were beside ourselves. She was really sick and Id go from her bedside to the neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors didnt think Oliver would make it. I was only 26 and in a state of shock.
Goldie and I were sobbing but Oliver pulled through and from that moment he was our precious miracle.
He was my first-born. I adored that child. When Kate came along, I loved her with all my heart, too. There was this deep love among the four of us for years. And thats what makes it so difficult to say goodbye.

Bill says clouds formed in the relationship over his wifes free spirit and desire for an open relationship.
Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldnt imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life.
When Goldie made a film, Cactus Flower, in London, her mother Laura moved into the marital home  a magnificent 10 million beachside villa in Malibu  and helped Bill care for the children.
Oliver was three and Kate four months old. Goldie went to Europe for a month. I stayed home on Daddy duty. I later found out shed been sleeping with one of her co-stars, French actor Yves Rnier.
I wanted a traditional marriage but Goldie couldnt settle. Eventually I moved out.
The marriage ended in 1981. Bill went on to have a long-term relationship with Love Story actress Ali MacGraw, before marrying Cindy Williams, star of TV comedy Laverne &amp; Shirley. They had two children Emily, now 31, and Zachary, 28, before that marriage also ended in divorce.

His youngest child is Lalania, nine, from a long-term relationship with a woman to whom he remains exceptionally close.
Meanwhile, Goldie met Kurt Russell in 1983. And while the pair have never married, their relationship is considered one of the happiest in Hollywood. When we first split up, I took a house on the beach in Malibu to stay close to the kids, says Bill. I was a part of their lives for years. Kate and Oliver came over at weekends, there were family holidays.
In fact, the photograph that Oliver posted on Instagram was taken by Cindy while we were on holiday in Florida. Goldie wanted a vacation with Kurt because theyd just got together and so Cindy and I took the kids to DisneyWorld. Everything was cool.
But he says Goldie used her increasing fame and financial superiority to freeze him out.
I call it parental alienation. We had a custody arrangement but Goldie constantly flouted it. Id turn up to see the kids and would discover Goldie had taken them on the private jet to her home in Colorado.
'She gave interviews about her wonderful relationship with Kurt and how the kids called him Pa. She described me as an absent father. Id call her and go Goldie, how can you say that? but shed just reply: Its a better story. 
As Kates fame grew she, too, accused her father of being an absentee dad: There was never a birthday card, she complained, to which Bill responds: Rubbish! I sent birthday cards every year.
I ring her up every birthday, still do. The same with Oliver. I bumped into Oliver fairly recently in a supermarket in Malibu and he gave me a hug. I always thought Oliver could be the peacemaker, that somehow he would help bring our fractured family back together.

Goldie poisoned them against me. She told the kids Id moved to Portland. I did go to Portland for eight months to make an album but then I came back to LA. I never abandoned my family. I never walked away. I wanted to be a father to Kate and Oliver but Goldie made it harder and harder for me to see them. Its all about control. What Goldie wants, Goldie gets.
He recalled going to mediation during their custody battle. Goldie grabbed my forearm as we were leaving and said to me: Its all about the money and power, babe.
When Oliver and Kate were in their early teens, Bill decided to end the court battles and told the children his door was always open to them. Oliver would come and stay with me. Wed go fishing, have sleep-overs. But Kate drifted away.
The pair enjoyed an uneasy rapprochement when Kate started dating Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson, father of her elder son Ryder, 11. She also has a three-year-old son Bingham with British rocker Matt Bellamy, from whom she split last year after four years.
At one point, I was writing a letter to my children every week for a year. Did those letters ever get to them? Who knows? When I read some of the comments on social media, it was so hurtful. People believe the bull****. Well, Im here to say its just not true. At first, Bill picks his words carefully over Kates Fathers Day photo of herself with Kurt. It was an intimate shot and, as her father, I found it inappropriate and unsettling. Ill leave it at that, he says.

Then, angrily, he adds: She wants to be Kurts daughter? Well then, take his name, stop using mine.
He has removed photographs of Kate and Oliver from his home and even thrown away their knitted baby booties which I carried in the glove compartment of every car Ive ever owned for good luck.
Last week, Oliver posted a reply to one fan in which he was unrepentant, emphasising his closeness to Kurt Russell: What started out as what I thought as a joke has turned into something more. And I embrace that. Ive done and continue to do a lot of work on myself to better understand what make me tick. Yes, science links us but love binds us. OH + KR = 
Bill is clearly still deeply wounded. He says: Oliver could have picked up the phone and called me but he hasnt. What shocks me is that this was clearly premeditated. He chose the photograph and posted it on Fathers Day, when he knew it would cause maximum pain. Oliver has lived in the shadow of his mother and sister all his life. Maybe he wanted to be in the headlines?
If what he wanted was me out of their lives, then hes succeeded. I dont want to see either of my eldest children ever again. Its over.
Goldie Hawn, Kate and Oliver Hudson did not comment last night.

	WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Chanttelle Ward, 19, from South Shields is trying to rebuild her life after being attacked by ex-boyfriend Rhys Culley, 24, at her home in February 2014.

'I was physically and mentally abused by my ex. He wouldn't let me wear certain clothes or speak to certain people, I couldn't wear make-up, it was silly things like that which I didn't realise were classed as domestic violence.'
Chanttelle (pictured left) when she was in a relationship withRhys Culley (right). He would control what she wore  and eventually physically attacked her
The teenager was left covered in blood after Culley bit her upper lip. He was found guilty of wounding with intent
In November jurors atNewcastle Crown Court heard how shopfitter Culley attacked Chanttelle in a jealous rage when she tried to leave him last year.
He bit down on her lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm-thick piece of rubber.
Shocking pictures of Chantelle's blood splattered face and the stitches she needed helped jurors find Culley guilty ofwounding with intent after he pleaded his innocence.
Chanttelle said she needed counselling to recover and she remains self-conscious about the scars she has been left with.

Chanttelle now wishes she had left Culley earlier, but she didn't realise she was a victim of domestic abuse despite the mental abuse she received
She told presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid this morning: 'He tried to bite my top lip off and it knocked my confidence. I have been left with two scars on my top lip and had to go to counselling for a year to get over the depression. I am trying to rebuild my life now.'
Chanttelle said she wishes she had recognised his behaviour was unacceptable before it was 'too late'.
Chanttelle said the scars have made her self-conscious and she was surprised when she was selected to take part in a beauty pageant
She spoke out on the breakfast TV show as figures released today show that a record number of people in England and Wales are being convicted of violent crimes against women.
There have been increases in the number of successful prosecutions for sexual offences and domestic violence cases, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) figures for 2014-15.
In total, some 107,104 defenders who committed violence against women and girls were prosecuted during this time-frame, a rise of 18.3% on the previous year.
Sarah Green, acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'The increase in prosecutions shows that more women are seeking justice with big increases, for example, in the number of rape prosecutions.
'If as a society we really care about ensuring justice for survivors, we should do everything in our power to try to prevent abuse in the first place. This has to start in schools, with compulsory sex and relationships education to give young people the chance to talk about respectful relationships.
'The CPS report includes figures on the alarmingly young age of many defendants in rape prosecutions. This is a call to urgent action.'
The report showed  the highest ever conviction rates for domestic abuse (68,601), rape (2,581), sexual offences (7,591), honour-based violence (129) and child abuse (7,469), with more than 10,000 additional defendants convicted for domestic abuse.
There was a 15 per cent rise in stalking and harassment prosecutions to over 12,000, and of these 1,103 prosecutions were commenced under the new stalking offences.
Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, believed today's report was 'really good news for the victims of these dreadful crimes'.
She said: 'Where cases meet the Code for Crown Prosecutors, we will not shy away from taking cases forward, even when they are difficult and complex.
Chanttelle (pictured before the attack) is feeling like her old, confident self thanks to being selected to represent Sunderland in the Miss North East beauty pageant
Culley of South Shields (pictured during his trial) was jailed for eight years last November
'Of course, this additional volume of violence against women and girls work brings challenges for prosecutors not only in terms of numbers, but the type of cases we are seeing - prosecutors across England and Wales are telling me that we are seeing more non-recent child sexual abuse cases and more of the particularly complex rape cases coming forward.
'Anyone who is a victim of these crimes should feel encouraged by this news and confident that they will be believed when reporting these crimes.'
Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: 'Today's report demonstrates that significant progress has been made in taking more cases of domestic violence through the criminal justice system. This is positive.
'This progress must continue until we have a system where women who experience domestic violence have exactly the same level of confidence as victims of other crimes, that they are heard and believed, the system works for them and protects their human right to live free from violence.'

During the 5.4million eight-month long inquiry, which examined the relationship between the Press and the public, police and politicians, Lord Justice Leveson heard evidence from 224 witnesses.
Part one of the inquiry examined the culture, practices and ethics of the press and the relationship between the press and the public, police and politicians.
Lord Leveson's report (pictured) into Press standards -ore than 250,000 of taxpayers' money spent on lawyers during the inquiry
Part two cannot begin until current police investigations and any criminal proceedings have been completed.
Last night Andy Silvester, campaign director from the Taxpayers Alliance, said: Taxpayers will be left wondering what this expensive inquiry actually achieved, other than lining the pockets of lawyers and putting plenty of innocent journalists in the dock.
The Cabinet Office has refused to name the individuals in receipt of the taxpayer-funded advice.
It raised questions over whether former ministers including Tony Blair - who had his legal advice paid for on the Chilcot Inquiry - received the financial support for their legal advice.

Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has installed a full-size Subbuteo football pitch in her Whitehall office
Crouch is a talented footballer who coaches a schoolgirls team.
Dog hears that acronym-obsessed mandarins cheekily refer to her (behind her back) as BILT thats Bend It Like Tracey.

Plebgate MP Andrew Mitchell has asked Dog to correct our report last week of Tory tycoon Michael Spencers 400,000 bacchanalian bash in Marrakech.
At Mitchs request, we are delighted to point out that fellow Conservative grandee Francis Maude did not parade round the hotel pool in an Arabic style jalabiya, or dishdash robe, looking like a twerp. Maude was in shorts.
No, the partying Tory in the dishdash was Mitchell. Glad to put the record straight.

'Worthless' wannabes
One of, if not the, most venerated of Labours elder statesmen MPs (no more clues) says he will refuse to vote for any of the partys four leadership contenders because they are all useless.
He confided in Dog: Burnhams burnt out, Yvette [Cooper]s wet, Kendalls worth sod-all and Corbyns a clown. We have only ever had two real winners in over a century  Tony Blair and Harold Wilson. None of this lot can hold a candle to them.
A senior Labour figure says all the party's leadership candidates are 'useless', including favourites Andy Burnham (left) and Yvette Cooper (right)

Lib Dem Adrian Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat in the election when his party was reduced to a rump of just eight MPs, refuses to throw in the towel.
Asked if he now felt powerless, Sanders said: No I dont  Castro invaded Cuba with just seven men. Is he Havana laugh?

Justice Secretary Michael Gove will rue the day he lectured mandarins on grammar.
Last week, he congratulated Scots Nat MP Kirsty Blackman on having been educated at Aberdeens Robert Gordons College, the same school as me.
Write 100 lines Master Gove: The same school as I. And learn the difference between an accusative and nominative pronoun.

	Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin yesterday announced a major u-tun on a major part of the Tories election manifesto admitting that they will not be able to go through with a £38bn Network Rail modernisation plan.

The Conservatives election manifesto had pledged: We will transform our railway network. We will invest 38billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme.
The decision to pull the plug on rail schemes in the North and the Midlands, while keeping HS2 and London projects such as Crossrail untouched, puts the Tories rhetoric in doubt. Mr McLoughlin told the Commons that the five-year rail improvement plan needed to be reset because it was now costing more and taking longer. He said electrification work was being paused on the Midland main line between London and Sheffield  where hundreds of millions has already been spent on preparatory work  and on the trans-Pennine Leeds-Manchester route.
The 38.5bn plan is being shelved, while the proposed 50bn HS2, artists impression, will continue
It is understood that the London Crossrail project will also remain unscathed from the planned review
Crossrail workers tunnel under Liverpool Street station
The aim is to keep Network Rails spending within its funding allowance, so that electrification of the Great Western line can be prioritised. Mr McLoughlin announced a shake-up of Network Rail management with the chairman  and former Ford boss  Richard Parry-Jones stepping down.
He will be replaced next month by Londons colourful transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy.
None of Network Rails executive directors will receive a bonus for the past year, Mr McLoughlin said. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne  who will keep his job  admitted they had been overly optimistic about meeting targets.
Labour said the Government knew the scale of the crisis before the election but sought to keep a lid on it to avoid damaging headlines.
In the Commons, Labour transport spokesman Michael Dugher told Mr McLoughlin: You spent the election campaign repeating promises you knew you would break. Ministers may try to shift all the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the Governments watch.
MP Clive Betts told Radio 4s PM programme: It has been becoming apparent over the past year that costs were going up and timescales were slipping, yet the Government kept this under wraps until after the election.
John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: This has been covered up for some time. There is a lot of anger that so many people have been misled by all this rubbish about the northern powerhouse. A lot of Tory MPs have been elected under false pretences.
Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: There have been clear signs since Christmas that Government is losing patience. And had it not been for a desire to avoid controversial headlines in the run-up to a General Election, the odds are that Network Rail would have been reformed by now in ways it may not have welcomed. There was suppressed Government fury at New Year, following the engineering embarrassments at Kings Cross and Paddington. But pre-election politics ensured a calm face.
Asked whether ministers knew before the election that the scheme was under threat, David Camerons official spokesman did not deny that this was the case. However, a Department of Transport spokesman said: Its not something the Secretary of State has kept hidden.
Tory backbenchers were angry that HS2 was not being cut. Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan said: I have always been worried that major projects such as HS2 would suck the life out of other areas.
If these projects are undeliverable now, what does that mean to the HS2 in a few years time. Will that become undeliverable too?
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: We have been promised time and time again that the money being pumped into HS2 would not affect the delivery of other infrastructure projects, but its clear that it is now cannibalising the rest of the railway budget and other upgrades with far more robust business plans are being shelved.
The 650,000 boss with a taste for kimonos and call girls: Colourful past of London transport chief tasked with rescuing Britain's rail network
By SAM GREENHILL
He has been credited with keeping Londons transport moving over the past decade.
But Sir Peter Hendy has also been caught up in a scandal that threatened to derail his private life.
Two years ago a 140-an-hour prostitute claimed she had a torrid affair with the 62-year-old transport supremo.
Rachael Grundy said she had a nine-month relationship with Sir Peter, a close ally of London Mayor Boris Johnson, while he masterminded the travel strategy for the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Sir Peter, left, is a close associate of Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is also now a Tory MP
Miss Grundy, 42, claimed he contacted her in November 2011 through an escort website. We hit it off immediately, she said.
According to Miss Grundy, he began booking her every week and she regularly stayed the night at Sir Peters London pied-a-terre in Pimlico while his wife was in the West Country.
Before long, they fell in love and she stopped charging him by the hour, but he still gave her money, she said.
He also gave her four Oyster travel passes worth 10 each and a London 2012 badge. She later remarked: He definitely wasnt very romantic when it came to gifts.
She was left heartbroken when Sir Peter dumped her after his wife Sue, 60, found out about their fling.
Sir Peter declined to comment about the affair, except to deny spending any public money on Miss Grundy.
He recently famously branded Britains commuter trains awful and like the Wild West. Yesterday, as he was put in charge of Britains rail network, there were plenty of long-suffering commuters hoping he may hold the ticket to making their daily journeys more comfortable.

He has run Londons complex transport system since 2006. As Transport for Londons commissioner, he is credited with overseeing many improvements and his efforts resulted in a knighthood in 2013.
Sir Peter is familiar with the rail network outside the capital, too, having spent the past ten years travelling regularly between London and the 1.5million Georgian villa in Bath he shares with his wife, an HR consultant and the mother of his two children.
Unlike the squashed-in masses, however, the multi-millionaire enjoys free first class travel  a generous perk earned as a result of an earlier job as a London Transport manager. A colourful character, Sir Peter once took the Tube to work wearing slippers and an elaborate oriental silk dressing gown to help raise money for Comic Relief.
Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses at TfL total more than 650,000, is happy to emphasise his working-class credentials. He sometimes turned up to London Assembly meetings in a bus workers high-visibility jacket and loves to speak in a gravelly Cockney accent  to the amusement of his former classmates at a top public school, Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. And even though his father was a communist firebrand, his mother was the daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford.
The Honourable Mary Best ran away from her familys ancestral home in Dorset and married electrician Jack Hendy. A Communist Party activist and leading member of the Electrical Trades Union, he was caught up in a ballot-rigging scandal and, although cleared by the courts, was banned for life from the union. He studied for a law degree at night school and became a barrister.
Sir Peter has been keen to portray his career as a rags-to-riches rise from lowly London bus conductor to self-made millionaire and transport supremo.
But, having studied economics at Leeds University, he actually began in 1975 as a fast-track graduate trainee with London Transport, which involved a few weeks work experience as a conductor as well as learning how to drive a bus.
He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a 34million management buyout in 1995  and his stake was worth 4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for 54million.
Although appointed as commissioner by Red Ken Livingstone, a close ally, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson. At one point he concluded: Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken. He also noted: I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, Im not sure Im more Left-leaning than he is.
ALEX BRUMMER: After this shambles HS2 can now be no more than a dream
During the General Election campaign, we heard much from Chancellor George Osborne about building a Northern Powerhouse, and plans for exciting investment in Britains Victorian infrastructure  but little about how it would be delivered.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Greens were mocked for commitments to renationalise all or parts of Britains creaking rail network.
Now, the truth has been revealed. The running of Network Rail  which owns and operates our railways  has been a shambles, electrification of key routes is way behind schedule and is having to be postponed or even cancelled, and the Tory government is being forced to take direct control of the network.
Former Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, pictured, created Network Rail on a not-for-profit basis in 2001 and created an ungainly board including unions, passengers and green groups with weak governance
The Government has been forced to abandon the electrification of the TransPennine Express, pictured
Passengers were left stranded last Christmas when engineering works overran causing chaos
The largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times was at the heart of the Conservatives long-term plan to secure Britains economic future, to improve productivity and growth. That part of the plan now looks to be in serious trouble, and it is difficult to see how it can easily be rescued at a time when state spending is under pressure.
The real scandal is that the slide into chaos of the Governments promised 38.5billion investment programme must have been known to civil servants and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin before the country went to the polls on May 7, but not a word crossed anyones lips.
Instead, the nation was treated to a naively optimistic view of a nation determined to revitalise rail travel. Plans included electrification of the TransPennine Express running between Manchester, Leeds and York; improvements of the Midland mainline linking London and Sheffield, and most significantly of all, the vanity HS2 project  estimated to cost up to 42.5billion.
As a result of the new announcements by McLoughlin, several of the key projects are being paused and mothballed, and there must be real questions as to whether the highly contentious HS2 should be, or will be, undertaken.
The immediate trigger for the Governments shake-up of Network Rail is the mayhem that has been endured by passengers. This was symbolised by the engineering works at Kings Cross station that overran during the last Christmas break, forcing passengers of the East Coast, Thameslink &amp; Great Northern lines to use inadequate Finsbury Park station in North London, which became dangerously over-crowded.

There have to be real questions over whether the HS2, artists impression, will ever go ahead
The holiday season pandemonium is just a microcosm of what many rail travellers have to suffer every day, with standing room only, unexplained delays and replacement bus services, and fares that rise inexorably despite the big taxpayer subsidies.
At the root of these problems was the then Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers decision in 2001 to place Railtrack into administration and replace it with a not-for-profit new firm Network Rail, run by an ungainly board of members drawn from all sections of society, from the trades unions to passengers and green groups.
The bizarre structure made for weak governance, which saw rail chieftains rewarding themselves like captains of industry but failing miserably to deliver the services the public craved. Labour eventually had to pay compensation to the Railtrack shareholders.
The impossible governance structure allowed the top brass at Network Rail to enjoy riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Chief executive Mark Carne has a base salary of 675,000 and was forced to forgo a bonus of 135,000 for 2014 (a sum almost equal to the Prime Ministers pay of 142,500) after the Christmas chaos. He is just one of a bunch of Network Rail executives whose pay, bonuses and pensions hover around the 1million mark.
This is nothing compared to the pay of some of the operating companies, with David Brown of Go-Ahead group which runs London-Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, earning a shade under 2million.
One of the immediate results of the changes just unveiled is that finally, after years of dissatisfaction with the way in which Network Rail has been governed, the byzantine structure is being abolished forthwith.
Instead, there is to be rule from Whitehall, with the former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown being parachuted in as Special Director of Network Rail and reporting directly to the Transport Secretary. Brown will work alongside the colourful Sir Peter Hendy, the new Network Rail chairman, who is credited with running the London Underground on time during the Olympics.
What is absolutely clear from the changes and the review that has been unveiled is that under the chairmanship of Richard Parry-Jones, who is to step down, Network Rail lost control of the costs of one of the governments most high-profile infrastructure projects.
As chief executive, Mark Carne admits the projects which Network Rails been charged with delivering are going to take longer and cost more than we originally thought.
The Governments promise to spend 38.5 billion on railways over five years does not seem to be at risk. What will be affected is the ambition to create a 21st-century electrified rail system to empower the North of England and improve the links with the capital.
Whatever the outcome of the Governments review  it is promising decisions by the autumn  the imbroglio raises huge questions over the future of the HS2 project, connecting London to Manchester and running through some of Britains most unspoiled landscaped in the Chilterns; and HS3, designed to go East-West across the North of England connecting Manchester to Hull.
If the relatively simple task of modernising and electrifying some of the busiest rail links in the country cannot be achieved  despite a generous infrastructure budget  then the high-speed projects can be no more than a pipedream.
As for long-suffering commuters and business travellers, the pain of rail travel will continue.
Direct control from Whitehall may be an improvement on the old Network Rail, but it cannot be the right long-term solution. Until the private enterprise disciplines of cost controls, efficient engineering and delivery of projects on time are brought to the rail network, the taxpayer will not get value for money.

	New depths of depravity demand a military response, writes LORD DANNETT, former Chief of the General Staff

	LORD DANNETT argues that not enough is being down to defeat and destroy the phenomena of Islamic State, who threaten the security of Britain - and mainstream Islam needs to denounce them.

It is therefore the subject that should be top of the In Tray in No 10, not just in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
To understand why the threat from the so-called Islamic State affects our security in the way that it does requires an understanding and an acceptance of what ISIL fighters and supporters are trying to do to achieve their objective.
Before ISIL burst into Iraq and Syria a year ago the notion of recreating the historic Islamic Caliphate had been endorsed and promoted by Osama bin Laden and his principal Al Qaeda lieutenants more than a decade ago.
Dead bodies at the Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait on Friday.The approach of the Islamic State is nothing less than the perversion of one of the worlds ancient religions for political gain, Lord Dannett writes
Alleged footage of the Kuwait Shia mosque blast
But it was generally thought that Al Qaeda was being contained somewhere between Afghanistan and Pakistan by NATO forces, including our own, and therefore the long term objective of creating a new Caliphate could be considered the philosophical ramblings of a hunted insurgent and placed on the back burner.
But the explosion of ISIL into our consciousness early last summer has changed all that. The issue of the Caliphate and what it means for us is a reality.
The ultimate objective of the new Caliphate is the restoration of Islamic influence to its high water mark in the fifteenth century, and that extends Islam beyond the greater Middle East, North Africa and parts of West Africa into southern Europe  specifically to southern Spain and the Balkans.
Does this matter, after all the influence of various religions has ebbed and flowed throughout history?
In general terms, in a more liberal and globalised world, it probably would not, or should, not matter, but the radical, hard line, fundamentalist Islamist approach that we are faced with today is a major challenge to the way of life not only to the nominally Judeo-Christian West but to mainstream Muslims too.
The approach of the Islamic State and its collection of allied groupings is nothing less than the perversion of one of the worlds ancient religions for political gain. The means, it would seem, justify the ends regardless of the horror involved.
Tunisia was attacked by ISIS, writes Lord Dannett, because it will drive tourists away from the country
Eye witnesses recount horror of Tunisia beach attack
It is against this background that Fridays attacks have to be seen. The one country that emerged from the mis-named Arab Spring with the prospect of better governance and a brighter future was Tunisia. But to the hard-line Sunni Muslim thinking of Islamic State this was a success that had to be destroyed.
Tunisia does not have much apart from tourists, therefore the tourists had to be attacked, intimidated and chased away. This may or may not happen, but after Fridays slaughter on the sunbeds many potential travellers and holiday-makers to Tunisia will think twice, or just simply book to go elsewhere.
The attack on the mosque in a generally peaceful Shia part of Kuwait was a different tactic but within the same perverted overall strategic plan.
To foment a Sunni-Shia struggle within Islam and then to take overall control in the chaos that follows is the operational design that the Islamic State death squads are following.
The fact that these two attacks took place on the same day within the holy month of Ramadan strongly suggests serious coordination within an overall plan.
On the other hand, the attack in France may or not have been part of the same coordinated set of actions. It seems as bizarre as it was outrageous and may have owed more to a personal dispute within an already very nervous France. Time will reveal more of the truth behind that attack.
So if the strategic objective of Islamic State is the recreation of the historic Caliphate and the operational design is to exploit the consequences of a fierce Sunni-Shia struggle for the heart of Islam, then the tactics of Friday should come as no surprise, notwithstanding the horror. The pressing question then becomes, what is our response to be?
It is tempting to say that we will stand on the side-lines of a civil war within Islam and merely contribute humanitarian or non-lethal aid but to do so puts our head into the sand and turns a blind eye to the purpose of that civil war.
David Cameron and Britain's allies need to put political pressure on countries like Saudi Arabia and Quatar who are dangerously ambiguousto Islamic State, and step up military assistance to help Muslims fight
David Cameron attends Armed Forces Day celebrations in Guildford
To have the aggressive, fundamentalist Islamism of Islamic State in southern Europe and the Balkans is something that we have to oppose now, and where it is today  far better to do so at arms length than in our own back yard.
After the NATO conference in Wales last Autumn a reluctant United States, cajoled into action by the energetic King Abdullah of Jordan and his supporters, eventually agreed a strategy to counter Islamic State and began to talk in terms of the need to defeat and destroy that phenomena. But with what degree of enthusiasm and commitment is that strategy being developed?
Yes, a coalition against Islamic State has been formed, many air forces are bombing ISIL fighters in Iraq and Syria, training teams are being deployed to build up the capacity of the Iraqi Army, the Peshmerga in northern Iraq and elements of the opposition forces in Syria, but is enough being done?
Against the gravity of the situation that I have described and the possible consequences for our own security, the answer has to be that we are not.
No one wants to see 5000 British troops deployed in the Middle East or in North or West Africa  a move that would most likely be counter-productive - but if we are to avoid that possibility there has to be a greater political and military will on behalf of our government, the United States and our European partners to do more  much more.
Political pressure needs to be placed on countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar who are dangerously ambiguous to Islamic State and military assistance needs to be stepped up in support of those Muslims prepared to fight to preserve the soul of their religion.
Moreover we need to hear the voice of mainstream Islam around the world denouncing and discrediting the perversion of their own religion.

	A petition calling for American Vogue's editor Anna Wintour to apologise for an article that suggests the supermodel's attraction to women could be a 'phase' has attracted more than 12,500 signatures.

Miss Delevingne also discussed the struggles she had faced while coming to terms with her bisexuality, something that many young men and women will be able to relate to.
In the interview she said: 'I think that being in love with my girlfriend is a big part of why I'm feeling so happy with who I am these days.
'It took me a long time to accept the idea [of being gay], until I first fell in love with a girl at 20 and recognized that I had to accept it.
'But I have erotic dreams only about men...The thing is 'if I ever found a guy I could fall in love with, I'd want to marry him and have his children.'
In the July 2015 issue, author of the piece, Rob Haskell, paraphrased the model claiming that her family believe the bisexuality is nothing more than a phase.
Haskell wrote for Vogue : 'Her parents seem to think girls are just a phase for Cara, and they may be correct.'
The interview appeared in the July issue of US Vogue, which featured Cara, 22, as its cover star
In the interview written by Rob Haskell, it was also suggested that Cara only formed relationships with women as a result of childhood trauma

He continued: 'When I suggest to Cara that to trust a man, she might have to revise an old and stubborn idea of hers - that women are perennially troubled and therefore only women will accept her - her smile says she concedes the point.'
Care2 petition author Julie Rodriguez says it's wrong of Haskell to equate same-sex relationships with childhood trauma or to characterise it as a phase.
Those signing the petition are hoping to catch the attention of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour
She said: 'The idea that queer women only form relationships with other women as a result of childhood trauma is a harmful (and false) stereotype that lesbian and bisexual women have been combating for decades.
'How could Vogue's editorial staff greenlight this article and publish it without anyone raising concerns about this dismissive and demeaning language?'
Many of those who have signed the Care2 petition added comments next to their signatures:
James Ferguson wrote: 'Dear Vogue, I have been in a queer 'phase' for the entire 50 years of my life. I think it is much more than a phase for millions of us.
'And I would have thought that you would know better than to perpetuate such dismissive, demeaning, and harmful stereotypes. I am deeply disappointed and believe a full, prominent apology is the very least that you can do for your readership.'
Robert Wallace added: 'My daughter is gay and it is NOT a phase; it is an integral part of who she is and I love and accept her, for who she is!'
Michelle Sorensen said: 'As a longtime subscriber to Vogue, I am very disappointed in the lack of empathy and care that Rob Haskell shows in his interview with Cara DeLevingne.
'Surely Mr. Haskell is a better listener, interviewer, and writer than this piece of his demonstrates. Vogue has made efforts to support the LGBT community; however, allowing this article to go to print makes me question how sincere this support is on their behalf.
'Vogue, please apologize for publishing such a careless and offensive piece in your pages. Thank you.'
A  Vogue spokesperson declined to comment.
MailOnline has also contacted MissDelevingne's representatives for comment.

	Labels 'lie' about the amount of salt in our food: Lab tests find amounts can be 10 per cent higher than stated on packaging

	High salt intake is linked to heart disease and stroke – two of Britain’s biggest killers - but new research shows that the true levels found in foods are often much higher than what is stated on the label.

        <MainBody>comments
Salt levels in popular products  including a healthy version of baked beans  are far higher than stated on the packaging, an investigation has found.
Heinz Beanz Reduced Sugar and Salt is meant to have 1.8g of salt in every 415g can. But a lab found that on average they contained 20 per cent more than that.
Nine out of 11 tins contained too much of the mineral to justify the reduced salt claim, found the research, commissioned for the Channel 4 programme Dispatches.
Hidden danger:High salt intake is linked to heart disease and stroke  two of Britains biggest killers - but the levels found in food are often much higher than what is stated on the packaging
And 18 out of 30 products tested had more salt than the label declared  including Dairylea ham and cheese crackers and Valley Foods chicken fillets.
High salt intake is linked to heart disease and stroke  two of Britains biggest killers. Most Britons eat more than the recommended maximum of 6g per day.
Dispatches also found that only 12 out of 73 companies that signed up to a voluntary salt reduction pledge in 2010 under the Governments Responsibility Deal had ended up meeting their targets.
A Heinz spokesman said its tins complied with the Governments guidelines. Mondelez, which owns Dairylea, said it had taken steps to rectify the matter and Valley Foods said it had amended their recipe to reduce salt.
Public health minister Jane Ellison defended the Governments record, saying average salt intake had reduced from 9.5g in 2000 to 8.1g in 2011.
Cutting it by a further gram could prevent almost 5,000 premature deaths a year and save the NHS 288million, she added.
Salt: Are You Eating Too Much? is broadcast on Channel 4 on Monday 29th June at 8pm.

An article on May 27 said that burglar Wayne Bishop had been released early from prison so that he could look after his five children on the grounds that their rights were more important than the rights of his victims. We are happy to make clear that the judgment in fact weighed the childrens rights against the seriousness of Bishops offences and not against the victims rights.
A graphic accompanying a news item published in one edition yesterday wrongly stated that the cost of Prince Harrys 2014 visit to Brazil and Chile was 185,626. In fact, as the article itself stated, the trip cost 85,626.

	Today, though, having just had the worst week of my life, I yearn for a few moments’ respite from the internet, after spending years in constant search of a wi-fi connection, by LIZ JONES.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Most spend half our lives in search of an internet connection
In the summer of 2000 I was on holiday in Jamaica, staying in Ian Flemings villa, Goldeneye.
It was the middle of the night, and I was in a rage because I couldnt find a phone socket to connect to the internet, which meant I couldnt file my copy.
In those days, you had to take a phone lead, and a different phone socket converter for every country (the socket for Milan was so huge it meant packing one less pair of shoes), before dialling up the internet.
I was crawling around the villa using a torch, as I didnt want to wake my boyfriend. It wasnt long before an armed security guard turned up, convinced I was being burgled. Which in a way I was: of my holiday and my sanity and my relationship.
My life since then has been one long, frantic quest for internet connection. In the foothills of the Himalayas, on a small island off Mozambique, in refugee camps in Haiti and on the border of Somalia, in a village in Bangladesh, in an earthquake zone in Pakistan, in a tent in Glastonbury.
I even had my phone screen held above my eyes when I came round from a general anaesthetic, just in case some awful tragedy had occurred while I was under.
I filed copy from my honeymoon, and even got my husband to read me the news headlines after undergoing laser eye surgery because I was wearing a metal grill over my eyes for 24 hours. My only respite was when on board a plane. This in turn made me phobic about air travel: not the flying or crashing part, but the safe landing, when I would switch on my smartphone and all manner of worrying emails would pop into the inbox.
Now even that brief holiday from being invited to Plan your funeral or Your Barclaycard statement is now ready or VAT to the quarter ending no longer exists, as you can use the internet on the plane. I have my smartphone and iPad with me everywhere  in the bath, horse riding, in bed, at my mums funeral  and it has become a ticking bomb of stress in my pocket when yet another email pops up that says, Are you OK? Have you read. and so I log on to some hateful remark, or read of some dreadful atrocity somewhere in the world.

	Mark Rouse, 48, of Southsea, Hampshire, who dodged paying for a permit for up to six months, has been jailed for 16 weeks for making the fake copy of a temporary permit he was given.

When it expired after six weeks he did not qualify for a free permanent permit as the Citroen C4 car he drove was not registered in his name.
Instead of buying 90p-a-day visitor permits which would have allowed him to continue to park on the street, Rouse made a fake permit on his computer using his expired temporary one as a template.
But the forgery was spotted by a parking officer and Rouse was confronted at his home by a council investigator, at which point he admitted using the counterfeit permit for up to six months.
Rouse admitted to one offence under the Fraud Act 2006, and one under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on June 17.
Councillor Ken Ellcome, cabinet member for traffic and transportation, said: 'Residents of many streets in Portsmouth value their permits because they mean it's possible to park near their homes.
'Forging a pass is an attempt to cheat the system and claim a parking space that is not yours - stopping other people using it. I hope the sentence will deter other potential fraudsters.'

AndCouncillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who has previously campaigned against charges being introduced for parking permits in the city, told MailOnline: 'Parking is a real problem in Portsmouth.
'Therefore if people are not playing by the rules, then people get really upset about that. If there are rules, people need to stick to them.'
But some local residents were angered by the length of the sentence.Gary Claus said: 'Is it just me or does anyone else think this is an unnecessarily harsh sentence considering much worse crimes often go with a lesser sentence?'
And Lloyd Chappell added: 'If you look at today's court round up with the crimes committed and sentences given, this is plainly ridiculous. I'm gobsmacked. This has to be overturned.'

However, RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams told MailOnline: 'Although on the face of it the sentence might appear harsh, the actions of this individual are classed as fraud which can carry very heavy sentences. Motorists, take note.'
Last night, neighbours of Rouse came to his defence. Stephen Ayub, 53, who runs a boat yard, said: 'I think it is a bit harsh to jail him.
'It is hardly the biggest crime in the world  we are talking about parking. There are plenty of people who do not get jailed for things like stealing and vandalism.'
Lloyd Chappell added: 'If you look at today's court round-up with the crimes committed and sentences given, this is plainly ridiculous.
'I'm gobsmacked. This has to be overturned.'
Trevor King, 53, an engineer, said: 'I have lived here for some time and I like being by the shops  but the parking is annoying.
'The shoppers will try all the side roads before they go to the supermarket's car park.
'Now the council are talking about making you pay for the permit for your first car, which is free at the moment, when you live in an area where you cannot guarantee a parking space.'

New research challenges belief that blueberries are ultimate health berry

For years, the health-conscious have sworn by the benefits of blueberries  a trendy import from the Americas.
But it seems there is something far better for us, much closer to home  the blackcurrant.
Researchers have found that the sharp berry, bushes of which used to be a regular feature in British gardens and allotments, contain far higher levels of health-boosting compounds than the blueberry.
researcher Dr Gordon McDougall of the James Hutton Institute near Dundee found blackcurrants can contain six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants of cultivated blueberries
We now eat tons and tons of blueberries, having been convinced they are a superfood that are particularly rich in polyphenols. These are naturally occurring antioxidant compounds said to help combat the development of heart disease and even cancer.
By contrast, fresh blackcurrants are a rarity on supermarket shelves. But researcher Dr Gordon McDougall of the James Hutton Institute near Dundee found blackcurrants can contain six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants of cultivated blueberries.
And exercise physiologist Matthew Cook of Chichester University has discovered that blackcurrants can even boost athletic performance.

Overlooking a sleepy valley in a remote area of the Hindu Kush, Langlands School is famous as the best in Pakistan.
But the peace has been shattered after a 97-year-old former British Army officer launched an astonishing move to oust the head teacher who he nominated as his successor.
Major Geoffrey Langlands, the last survivor of the Raj, mounted a coup to unseat Carey Schofield, 61, from the school in Chitral that bears his name. She only found out about his action when she returned to Britain and was surprised to discover her visa renewal had been inexplicably delayed.
Power play: Former school head Major Geoffrey Langlands, pictured above at his retirement in 2013
Last week, it appeared the Major had succeeded in his mission  with the help of some of his former pupils  after accusing Miss Schofield of upsetting parents and teachers with her rigorous management style. There was no question of her coming back he said in an interview.
But now Miss Schofield, who said the pupils behaved like the cast of St Trinians when she first took charge, has told The Mail On Sunday she has no intention of standing aside and will return to Chitral as soon as possible.

She said: Major Langlands has no power to sack me. Im not at war with anybody. The coup was presented as having been successful but actually it wasnt.
I am delighted by the support I have received not only from the governors but also from the teachers, the parents and the pupils for me to return and get on with the job.
It is very frustrating. This term, for example, for the first time in the senior girls school we had a school play going. It doesnt sound like much but it was a groundbreaking event in our district. Much bigger than this joke attempt at a coup. But because I was stuck here, I didnt see it and thats really heartbreaking.
It is a tale that evokes the days of the Raj and a lost empire.
Langlands, who is known as Pakistans Mr Chips  after the book about a beloved teacher  had been the principal of the school for more than two decades until Miss Schofield took charge in 2013 when he decided to step down.
The Major, who has taken tea with Princess Diana, enjoys celebrity status in Pakistan. He came to British India in 1944 during the last years of the Raj, before going on to teach cricketer Imran Khan and many of Pakistans future rulers at Aitchison college, known as the Eton of Pakistan.
Visa delays: Headteacher Carey Schofield in London last week
He joined Langlands, then Sayurj Public School, in 1989. Under his tenure, the school projected a reputation for excellence. But Miss Schofield says that was a myth.
Speaking near her one-bedroom flat in Chelsea, she said: The legend Major Langlands so successfully created was of the old military man who taught in England before the Second World War. Thats what people thought they were getting. In reality it was worse than any Pakistani school. The legend was built on sand.
There was no connection at all between the myth he was peddling and the education he was giving. The school was in a parlous state. School fees used to be collected in cash. There were widespread allegations of theft. Teachers were not always paid.
The school was like St Trinians. The children were not turning up and left whenever they wanted. Some teachers didnt come to school and if they did would sit drinking tea while the classes rampaged. There was no discipline. Weve had to restore order on every front.
Born in Surrey, Miss Schofield read English at Cambridge before becoming a foreign correspondent. She has written several books, including one about Pakistans army.
She says she drew on her experience as a school governor in Britain to transform Langlands. The school, founded in 1988 by local deputy commissioner Javed Majeed, now provides education for almost 1,000 girls and boys aged from four to 18. Under Miss Schofield, the bank now handles all fees, the school operates fully in English, students wear uniform and prospective pupils must sit an entrance exam. Earlier this year, she sacked eight of the schools 54 teachers who were under performing.
In Pakistan it is culturally not the norm to be sacked, Miss Schofield says. But Imran Khans government has said government schools will get rid of people who cant perform and hes right. All eight sacked teachers are taking the school to court for breach of their fundamental rights.
It is also suspected some contacted the Major for help.
When Miss Schofield flew to London last month, Langlands travelled to Chitral and attempted to seize control of the school. He also urged Pakistans interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar  a former pupil of his  not to renew Miss Schofields visa.
Nearly 200 parents and virtually all of the staff have signed petitions calling for the Majors orders to be ignored.
The visa hasnt been refused, Miss Schofield said. It just hasnt been granted yet. Langlands last night told the MoS: I have been working in Pakistan for 71 years and everyone has been satisfied with everything that I have done.
The real reason the lady doesnt like me is because Ive got too much support. I hope all will turn out well for the school but that cannot be with the presence of the lady.

	Avengers star Patrick Macnee dies aged 93

	Patrick Macnee, best known for his role as John Steed in The Avengers, has died of natural causes at his home in California aged 93, according to a statement by his son Rupert.

For a time he acted at The Windsor Repertory Theatre, in London's West End, and went on tours in Germany and the United States.
He also accepted some minor film roles, including that of Young Marley in Alastair Sim's classic version of A Christmas Carol.
Early in 1950 he was invited to travel to Canada by friend David Greene, a director friend at CBC in Toronto, and he left England within 48 hours to work overseas.
Despite his typically English exteriror, Macnee actually spent a large part of his adult life working in the U.S., taking minor roles on American TV shows.
He only returned to the UK in the 1960s in order to take on his defining role as John Steed as The Avengers began shooting in London.
Macnee's character appeared in all but two episodes, accompanied by a string of beautiful women who were his sidekicks.
Macnee was educated at Eton and served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, which turned out to be perfect preparation for the part of John Steed - who was also supposed to have studied at Eton, and fought against the Nazis
While Macnee's co-stars  (pictured here with Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt in The New Avengers) often used guns, John Steed never wielded a weapon and was known for his skill with an umbrella
Despite being a sex symbol, Macnee said he missed missed most of the Swinging Sixties due to being locked in a studio filming from 5.30am to 9.30pm five days a week
Patrick Macnee sits on international film festival jury
The most popular was likely Diana Rigg, who played sexy junior agent Emma Peel from 1965 to 1968. Honor Blackman played Catherine Gale from 1962 to 1964, and Linda Thorson was Tara King from 1968 to 1969.
In his final interview in The Lady magazine, he was asked which of the three he found the most appealing.
He replied: 'The very first thing you learn if you're a gentleman is that you never compare one woman to another. That's the way of all death.
'You get a big pointed high heel in your groin and you'll never walk again!'
However, in a follow-up interview in 2010 he was rather less discreet, saying:Honor was adorable. She was the most beautiful of them all.
'A gorgeous blonde with the biggest breasts youve ever seen and beneath them the beautiful athletic body of a runner.
Of Diane Rigg, he said: She was probably one of the best actresses.She made The Avengers the enormous success it was because she was in the first episodes made for American TV when they hadnt seen a woman in a skintight leather catsuit throwing men around.
Linda Thorson was a great actress with a great body but she arrived just as The Avengers was losing its appeal.
Macnee was married three times and first tied the knot aged 19 toBarbara Douglas, with whom he had two children. He went on to marryCatherine Woodville (pictured) andBaba Majos de Nagyzsenye
Sir Roger Moore has led tributes to Macnee, saying:'So very sad to hear Pat MacNee has left us. We were mates from the 1950s and I have so many happy memories of working with him. A true gent'
Speaking about his role as a surprise Sixties sex symbol, he added:  I missed so much of the Swinging Sixties by working.
From 1961 to 1969 I got up at 4.30am, a car came for me at 5.30am and I was taken to our studio at Teddington or Elstree and we filmed until I got home at 9.30pm, five days a week.
'I spent most of the Sixties in a giant shed filming even though I lived around the corner from the Kings Road in Chelsea.
After the original show finished in 1969, Macnee became a frequent guest on television talk shows around the world, famed for his traditional British humour and intelligence.
He went on to star in Bond film A View To A Kill alongside Roger Moore, as well as The Howling and The Sea Wolves, which Moore also starred in.
Author and playwright Bonnie Greer added: 'When I was a kid, some folks were 'one of us' - Leonard Nimoy and Patrick Macnee. Dude of dudes. RIP Patrick Macnee.'
Goodness Gracious Me actor Sanjeev Bhaskar paid a warm tribute to Macnee on Twitter, saying: 'RIP Patrick Macnee. The Avengers also warm and wonderful foil to Sir Roger Moore in several films and Spinal Tap. Epitome of the British Gent.'
After The Avengers, Macnee continued to appear on stage and screen, starring opposite Roger Moore in James Bond movie A View To A Kill
Raised in Lambourn, Berkshire, Macnee spent the last 40 years of his life at his home in Coachella Valley in California, where he died today with his family by his bedside
He took a turn on stage in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, which saw him take off on an international tour, and also penned two books based on The Avengers, alongside an autobiography.
In the 70s he returned to television in order to reprise the character of John Steed in The New Avengers, alongside Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt.
He guest-starred and played continuing roles in numerous American, British and Australian television productions.
He recorded numerous audio books, including thirteen Jack Higgins titles, and voice-over narrations for the four hour mini-series 'America at War in Color' and many others.
Musing on life during an interview five years ago, aged 88, Macnee said: Im not afraid of death. Whats to fear? Once youre dead, thats it. Nothing.
'I dont believe in heaven or hell. Thats baloney. What matters is the here and now. Yes, Im 88 and there are things I cant do: I cant run a race or climb Everest. But isnt life magnificent?
He was married three times but pre-deceased by all his wives. He is survived by two children and one grandchild.

As a result, it is all too easy for them to kill us, and very hard for us to protect ourselves. However hard we prepare, however elaborate our security measures, such attacks cannot always be forestalled or prevented.
There simply cannot be an absolutely reliable solution to this problem. There will be unpredictable danger, and we should beware of any voices that suggest we can ever be entirely safe.
We should also be cautious of attempts to use such events as a pretext for more intense surveillance of our lives or renewed restrictions on civil liberties, such as those attempted by the Blair and Brown governments.
This is the man ISIS has claimed carried out the attack in Sousse - named by them as Abu Yahya Al Qayrawani
Instead, we need a judicious mixture of policies: the encouragement of a British Islam, loyal to this country and vigilant against fanatics in its ranks; cautious engagement with the Arab and Muslim world, accepting the need to deal with unattractive regimes rather than optimistic attempts to introduce Western democracy by revolution or war; realistic warnings to travellers abroad about the risks they may face; uncompromising border controls, able both to detect dangerous arrivals and prevent them from entering our territory.
All of these need to be backed by continuing efforts to build intelligence and security services which know and understand those parts of the world from which the threat comes. The scalpel is more effective against such foes than the blunt instruments favoured by New Labour.
None of these things will be easy. Some of them will be costly, and divert scarce resources away from treasured or popular purposes. But, as we survey the grief and carnage of Sousse, and as the survivors hurry home from holidays that turned in a moment to horror, can anyone seriously say that it will not be worth it?

By contrast, only 5,460 or four per cent of students had ended up in these menial elementary occupations six months after graduating in 2007.
In 2013/14, 68 per cent of employed graduates were in professional jobs such as working as managers, directors, senor officials and in technical occupations.
Graduates are also faced with earning an average salary of just 21,500 after leaving university, despite courses now costing 9,000-per-year (file image)
The average salary six months after graduation was 21,500.
Frances OGrady, general secretary of the TUC, yesterday attacked the poor job prospects for some graduates.
He said: For many university leavers, the prospect of finding a job that matches their talents is gloomy.
Despite paying huge amounts to get a higher education, many are being forced to take on lower-skilled jobs, which is in turn pushing those who dont have a degree out of the labour market altogether.
Young people are simply not getting the opportunities they deserve. If we don t create better jobs for graduates we wont be able to build the higher-skilled workforce the UK desperately needs to boost productivity and compete with other countries.
The governments economic plan is failing to solve this career gridlock, but action is urgently needed. Bemoaning the lack of decent graduate jobs is becoming an annual event.
A report warned last year that the growing number of workers who are over-qualified for their role is largely the result of a huge expansion in univeunrsity education.
The centre-left think-tank the Institute for Public Policy research (IPPR) said the number of high-skilled jobs has not kept pace with the rate at which workers are becoming more highly qualified.
School-leavers would be better prepared for the job market by doing an apprenticeship instead of racking up huge debts at university, the report claimed.

	Two-thirds of hay fever sufferers also battle symptoms at NIGHT

	As pollen levels peak this weekend, experts warn people who suffer from what pharmacists have labelled ‘insneezia’ to close their windows at night.

Whilst its impossible to avoid grass and other pollens, if you are taking the right preventer medicines  you should be able to manage day-to-day without getting any asthma symptoms.
But she added: If you are wheezing, coughing, waking at night or feel tightness in your chest now then you need to speak to your GP or asthma nurse.
Some 18million people in Britain have hayfever.
Research by Boots suggests 64 per cent find their symptoms affect their sleep.
When pollen levels peak, experts warn people who suffer from what pharmacists have labelled insneezia to close their windows at night
In a poll of 2,080 sufferers, the average sleep loss was 72 minutes of sleep each night when pollen levels are high.
Boots pharmacist Angela Chalmers said: Falling pollen at night doesnt have to get in the way of a good nights sleep if you take steps to keep your hayfever symptoms in check before your head hits the pillow.
Most one-a-day anti-histamines are usually a 24-hour dose, so taking your daily dose at least three hours before you go to bed may help reduce symptoms throughout the night.
The NHS advises that people keep windows shut at night and first thing in the morning, and also suggests sufferers stay indoors as much as they can when the pollen count is high.
Despite the impending misery, Dr Emberlin, speaking on behalf of Opticrom Hayfever Eye Drops, said there are steps hayfever sufferers can take to ease their symptoms...
KNOW YOUR ALLERGY TRIGGERS
Dr Emberlin, said: 'It helps to know your allergy triggers.
'Keep a diary with notes about when and where your symptoms occur.
Experts advise trying to avoid going out when the pollen count is high if you suffer from hayfever
'Match it against a pollen calendar to see what is in the air.
'Most people who have hay fever in the summer months are allergic to grass pollen but you could be reacting to pollen from summer flowering trees, weeds or crops.
'Also you could be allergic to fungal spores that can be in the air on dry or damp days.'
AVOID GOING OUTSIDE WHEN THE POLLEN COUNT IS HIGH
Experts advise trying to avoid going out when the pollen count is high.
Dr Emberlin told MailOnline: 'On dry warm days grass pollen counts are highest from early to mid morning and from mid to late afternoon.
'This is when most grasses release their pollen. In the middle part of the day convection currents mix the air and dilute concentrations.'
DON'T CUT THE LAWN
Dr Emberlin, said a top tip is to avoid cutting the lawn, or failing that, get someone else to take on the chore for you.
'Although the short grass on lawns will probably not flower and release pollen, the sap from the cut grass will form aerosols containing grass allergens which could trigger your hay fever,' she said.
WEAR SUNGLASSES
'If you have problems with itchy and runny eyes, wear wrap round sunglasses to help keep pollen out of the eyes,' Dr Emberlin said.
'Wash eyes frequently especially after being outdoors, and use anti allergy eye drops to alleviate the symptoms.'
'Alcohol in excess will suppress the immune system and can make symptoms worse,' Dr Emberlin said.
PACK YOUR DIET WITH VITAMIN C
A healthy diet can help ease symptoms, Dr Emberlin told MailOnline.
She said: 'Aim to have a healthy diet with a high intake of vitamins especially C and D as these are thought to be beneficial for hay fever sufferers.
'Avoid drying washing outdoors on high pollen count days. The washing acts as an air filter collecting the pollen which will then be brought indoors.'
AVOID TOO MUCH ALCOHOL
'Alcohol in excess will suppress the immune system and can make symptoms worse,' Dr Emberlin said.
Other notable triggers, include dairy food, which increase mucus secretion.
And air pollution especially from vehicles and cigarette smoke is known to cause irritation to the airways and eyes and make the symptoms worse.
In addition, Dr Emberlin told MailOnline swimming in indoor pools can make symptoms worse because the chlorine in the water can irritate the airways and eyes.
Stress and dehydration can also make symptoms worse, she warned.

	The fighters said they fully secured the Syrian border town of Kobani today, killing more than 60 Isis militants in the process, just two days after the hardline group attacked it with suicide bombers.

In Kobani, the YPG blew up a school building used by Isis earlier on Saturday, the Observatory said, and plumes of smoke could be seen rising into the air from the Turkish side of the border.
Isis killed around 200 civilians in the town and surrounding areas in the attack which started on Thursday, the Observatory said, describing it as one of the worst massacres committed by the group in Syria.
Badly injured: One of the victims of the violence in Kobane is led over the Syrian-Turkish border to safety
Devastated: A man seeks consolation after the latest devastating violence in the small town of Kobane
Kobani was the site of one of the biggest battles against Isis last year.
The Kurdish YPG force drove the militants back from the town with the help of U.S. air strikes, after four months of fighting and sieges.
The YPG previously described the latest attack on Kobani as 'a suicide mission' rather than an attempt to capture the town.
On Thursday, Dorpec Kobane, a Swedish/Kurdish doctor who had been treating wounded civilians and YPG members, began to fight when terrorists stormed the town and began shooting men, women and children.
He said their lifeless bodies were strewn across Kobane after the terror group  attacked the town from three sides.
Desperate Syrian Kurds from Kobane behind the border fences wait to cross into Turkey following the attack
Dr Kobane said: 'War is in full bloom in Kobane again. They came in last night disguised as Free Syrian Army and YPG militia men - they had their types of military uniforms on and they had shaved beards.
'The first thing they did was attack and take over the Doctors Without Borders hospital.
'Then four suicide bombers attacked different parts of the city. But they also had many snipers with them. They have been shooting like lunatics, mainly children and women.
'There are bodies of children and women spread all over - they shot like maniacs.'
In the interview provided by A Demand for Action, a global initiative protecting for ethnoreligious minorities in the Middle East, Dr Kobane added: 'Right now I have changed my doctors tools to a machine gun.
'I am helping our soldiers to eliminate the threat, I am more needed here now than in hospitals. We are less then 150 meters away from an ISIS stronghold - a section of the city they took over this morning.
'I cannot help anyone if all of Kobane is taken over by the terrorists.  Of course I wish I could help them. But we are strong. We will not give up. We will win Kobane back.'
Battleground: The offensive came just days after Kurdish forces captured the strategic towns of Tal Abyad and Ain Issa, placing them just 30 miles from the caliphate's self-declared capital of Raqqa in Syria
Dr Kobane has not been heard from since he was interviewed.
In the northeast, Isis seems to be attempting to wrestle Hasaka city from government control.
Syrian state television said on Saturday the city was safe and under control, but the Observatory said fierce clashes continued in the southwest, south and southeast.
Hasaka is important to all sides fighting in an area that sits between Isis held territory in Syria and Iraq and which reaches north up to the Turkish border.
Isis launched an assault on government-held areas of Hasaka early on Thursday and the United Nations says the violence is estimated to have displaced up to 120,000 people.
Isis said in statements on Saturday it attacked areas east of the city and in a video posted online claimed to have entered western areas. State television quoted the head of the police in Hasaka as saying its special forces had 'eliminated Daesh terrorists' in the city, using an Arabic acronym for the group.
Choking: Thick black smoke rises over the Syrian town of Kobane following the ISIS attacks on Thursday
Hasaka is divided into areas run separately by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and Kurdish authorities and has a mixed population of Arabs, Kurds and Christians.
Isis has been back on the offensive after two weeks of defeats at the hands of Kurdish-led forces, supported by U.S.-led air strikes.
This week the Kurds advanced to within 50 km (30 miles) of Raqqa city, the group's de facto capital.
Late on Friday Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi appealed to residents to take up arms to defend Hasaka.
'I call on every man, every young woman and every young man able to carry weapons to move immediately and join the frontline positions to defend the city,' he said on state television.
While Isis had managed to advance slightly in Hasaka on Friday, seizing one army position, heavy Syrian air force strikes hindered the attack, according to the Observatory.
The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing government figures, said that since the attack on Hasaka started 120,000 people were estimated to have been displaced within the city and to surrounding villages, as well as to the northern districts of the province.

According to a source the meeting took place at around 3:45 pm on Friday.

'They discussed their shared interest in combatting the illegal wildlife trade' Wills and Kate, both 33, reportedly got on splendidly with the Hollywood A-listers. The couple are pictured at the10th annual ARK (Absolute Return for Kids) in 2011
Angelina, 40, was joined by husband Brad, 51, and they went to Kensington Palace for their chat.
The Royal couple were said to be 'really excited' about the afternoon tea,
The Duke and Duchess, according to the source, were joined by their son Prince George - who will be two years old in July, but the Jolie-Pitts children were not present.
The Hollywood pair brought a special gift for their daughter Princess Charlotte, who was born in May.

Angelina and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in the city.
She also attended a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner at a nearby camp and visited refugees.
It was Jolie's third visit to Turkey since 2011, when the conflict in Syria began. The war has displaced more than 3million refugees, or almost a fifth of the pre-war population.

The USA, China and Russia all want to develop missiles that can travel at 4,000mph (stock image)
An arms race is speeding up between three of the world's most powerful countries, as each looks to develop missiles and fighter jets that travel more than five times the speed of sound.
Military scientists in the United States, China and Russia are independently attempting to build fighter aircraft and missiles that can travel at 4,000mph as part of a new type of hypersonic weapon.
While China and Russia want to invent missiles that are able to outsmart US ballistic defence systems, American researchers want the technology to be able to hit 'time sensitive' targets that can hit fast-moving objects with greater accuracy.
Should they be successful, the US Air Force is expected to seek the help of NASA to prepare pilots for travelling at Mach 5 speeds.
Scientists at the US laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, are within reach of creating weapons able to travelat Mach 5, with on official describing the development as 'game-changing technology', Michael Evans of The Times reported.
Researches in the US and Russia have carried out test flights of the new 'game-changing technology'
They have carried out four test flights of the X-51 WaveRider, its hypersonic vehicle, with one flying more than 230 nautical miles at 4,000mph, and the Russian tested their version, Yu-71, in February unsuccessfully.
On Thursday the deputy US defence chief said Russia was 'playing with fire' with its nuclear armament programme, and the country was determined to prevent it from gaining a significant military advantage.

Almost half of the 2,000 couples surveyed either stayed in the UK or ventured no further than the Continent for their break
One in five said the pressures of work meant they didnt have time to go away for two weeks.
Meanwhile, 30 per cent said the fact they had to pay for their wedding  or contribute heavily to the cost  meant they couldnt afford an extravagant trip.
Almost half of UK newlyweds (49%) now either stay in the UK or venture no further than Europe for their post-marital mini-moon, the LateRooms.com study revealed.
By contrast, in 2005 the top honeymoon destinations for Britons were Hawaii, Tahiti, Fiji, St Lucia, Mexico, Jamaica and Anguilla.
LateRooms.com spokeswoman Andrea Tarpey said: With newlyweds footing more of the bill for their big day than ever before, and having greater demands on their time at work, were seeing couples embrace the mini-moon and taking shorter, less costly getaways closer to home.
With such a fantastic range of destinations on our doorstep, 32% of couples choose to head to Europe, whilst a growing number (17%) opt to stay in the UK to enjoy their first week as Mr and Mrs.
'Growing in popularity, some 20% will opt for an American mini-moon.
We understand the pressures of modern couples striving to achieve the perfect wedding day as well as the perfect honeymoon, which is why we launched weddingguestrooms.com to help brides and grooms provide a personalised site with the very best accommodation options for their guests.

	Ty Rees saves choking sister Star Tyack after watching St John Ambulance’s Chokeables advert

	Confronted by a choking toddler, other children might have panicked. But 12-year-old Ty Rees, from Tuffley in Gloucester, saved his little sister’s life after he remembered watching a first aid advert.

Ty called for his mother and her boyfriend Kevin Blackburn, who gave Star another back slap. Three 5p coins shot out of her mouth.
Miss Tyack, 38, of Tuffley, Gloucester, said: 'Ty was absolutely fantastic. He's a complete hero. He was so quick and so calm.
Ty remembered a recent advert (pictured) on how to stop a baby choking - and saved his little sister's life
Star Tyack (pictured with Ty) had swallowed some 5p coins, leaving her unable to breathe or make a sound
'In instances like this every second counts and what Ty did saved his sister's life.'
The ordeal happened on Tuesday after Star took the coins from her brother's rucksack.
Miss Tyack added: 'He literally screamed for help. I've never heard anything like it  my boyfriend and I were there in seconds but the fact he had already dislodged the coins when we got there was amazing.
'In the time we were getting there he did exactly what he should have  he started hitting her back. Then she cried. He saved her life.'
Following the ordeal Marie and Kev, 27, took Star to hospital to get her checked over, but she was fine and scans showed she had swallowed no more foreign objects.
The offending 5p coins which Star choked on
Miss Tyack said she made Ty watch the St John Ambulance 'Chokeables' video after his sister began walking, adding: 'When I showed it to him he said, 'I'm never going to be on my own with Star, so I don't need it'.
'But I told him he needed to watch it in case. He said that as soon as he saw Star choking the video just started playing in his head and he knew exactly what to do.
'He was amazingly brave and I just want to thank St John Ambulance for making the film that showed him how to save my little girl's life.'
Jim Jones, a training manager for St John Ambulance, said: 'Our video campaign was aimed at showing people what to do if a baby aged under 12 months was choking.
'But, while the techniques are different for older children and adults, the principles of how to save someone's life in that situation are similar.
'In an emergency, it is better to do something than do nothing and Ty delivered first aid when it mattered most.
'Incidents like this show why it is absolutely vital that every child learns the skills to save lives and St John Ambulance is campaigning hard to get first aid taught in every school.'

35-year-old marketing and communications manager, Sharon Bosward, signed up to challenge herself, but was terrified of the end goal.
Id never watched a UFC fight before I signed up for this and then at the start we met up and watched it at a bar and I couldnt even watch it, I was just covering my eyes the whole time, I was horrified, Ms Bosward told Daily Mail Australia.
I thought it was the most brutal thing I had ever seen, I felt ill.
But after weeks of gruelling workouts and conditioning sessions, Ms Bosward started to understand the skill behind the fighting and was ready to take on the challenge.
Gruelling workouts: Ms Maan (left) and Ms Bosward (right) underwent major physical and mental changes
'It's something you're not used to': Ms Hidajat (left) and Ms Maan (right) cried both cried during the early sparring sessions
As the lightest female in her group, Ms Bosward suffered intense injuries, with the weight on her body from other fighters damaging the cartilage in her ribs, crushing her body and leaving her unable to sleep properly, lie down, sit up or laugh.
Ms Bosward also suffered a suspected broken nose during a shark tank session.
I was in there and on the ground and one of the other girls was trying to get me into a specific headlock and her shin came down, smashed me across the nose and mouth and she pretty much broke my nose, Ms Bosward said.
It was accidental but I just went into shock and sat there and started shaking and the next minute there was blood everywhere and two trainers had to come and lift me off the mat because the blood was just waterfalling and it kept going all day.
Before and after: Ms Bosward, 35, transformed her body during the intense conditioning training
'What I did to Sharon was quite shocking': Ms Hidajat (pictured) accidentally gave Ms Bosward a suspected broken nose
Renata Hidajat, 25, was the fighter responsible for the break and as someone who was already trying to cope with the concept of fighting someone, was shaken by the ordeal.
The first time I got hit in the face I just started crying instantly it is just something youre not used to, Ms Hidajat told Daily Mail Australia.
'It was quite shocking...my leg slipped from the sweat and my shin cracked her on top of the nose.'
What I did to Sharon was quite shockingmy leg slipped from the sweat and my shin cracked her on top of the nose and it was quite shocking to me because there was so much blood and I was questioning why I was thereI didnt want to hurt anyone.
Angela Maan, 33, was already fit before heading into the series as a keen trail running athlete, however found the training to be completely different to what she was used to.
Im still getting my heard around hitting people and for the first three weeks I basically cried during or after every sparring session, Ms Maan told Daily Mail Australia.
It was challenging mentally because Ive never been hit or hit anyone in my life and Ive seen people fight in movies but it is more confronting and emotional than I ever expected.
'It is more confronting and emotional than I ever expected': The women were not expecting the training to be as emotionally draining as it was
Before and after: Ms Hidajat became leaner and stronger over the six months
Ms Maan experienced extreme bruising and rolled both her ankles throughout the period, and says all the contestants have a method for coping with the pain.
We have a trick where we lather up in Voltaren and bruising cream and cling wrap ourselves while we sleep overnight to recover, she said.
Founder of Wimp 2 Warrior and trainer Richie Cranny, told Daily Mail Australia that to be able to get people mentally strong enough to step into a cage in front of 1,000 people and fight is tough.
They all get to that point where they doubt themselves and break down and cry but you dust them off and push them straight back out  theres no going home- they just need to get their gloves back on and get back in there, Mr Cranny said.
'You dust them off and push them straight back out': Trainer Richie Cranny believes in tough love
Wimp2Warrior: The ladies' final fights will take place across the 1st and 2nd of July at Luna Park
Its an armchair sport and people dont look at these athletes on TV and think I can do that but these people are doing it.
Regardless of the pain, the women have undergone incredible mental and physical transformations and will participate in their final fight on July 1st and 2nd at Luna Park in Sydney.
Proud of what they have achieved, the women say the regret of not fighting at the end is worse than any injury.
Regret would be a harder pill to swallow than copping a few punches in the face Im feeling pretty proud of myself, Ms Maan said.

He told the audience: Let me tell you about my trouble with girls... three things happen when they are in the lab... You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry.
Sir Tim, who won a Nobel Prize in 2001, later said his comments were light-hearted. But he quit his honorary professorship at University College London after allegedly being told to resign or be sacked, leading him to feel he had been hung out to dry.
Resigned: Sir Tim Hunt has now quit his professorship at University College London
A leaked European Commission source backed up his account of the speech, saying it was warm and funny and that he said now seriously after his controversial comments to show they were intended as a joke. But Mrs St Louis, who lectures at City University in London, said yesterday: Whatever he said after now seriously, its still outrageous. He talks about women as girls... you make them cry, they fall in love with you, is he seriously saying that? Is that his own personal story? Why is he calling them girls? And then he goes on to advocate single-sex laboratories. Now seriously, is he thinking there should be single-sex laboratories?
On his return to the UK, Sir Tim resigned from roles at UCL, the Royal Society and the European Research Council. His wife said she was told by a senior UCL figure understood to be Dean of Life Sciences Geraint Rees  that he should resign or be sacked.
But yesterday a UCL source denied this version of events. They said there was little chance of Sir Tim being given his honorary professorship back, adding: I dont think reinstatements on the agenda and I dont think Sir Tim wants it.
Rather than his reinstatement, the [universitys governing council] is likely to discuss the issues about women in science and the coverage in the media, and how its been handled by UCL management. But what a mess it all is.

	Andy Green crashes Jaguar XJ Bloodhound SSC at Goodwood

	World land speed record holder Wing Commander Andy Green lost control of the specially built Jaguar XJ Bloodhound SSC rapid response vehicle at a notorious corner on the mile long hill climb at the event held in the stately grounds of the Earl of March.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
He admitted: 'it was 100 per cent my fault.
'We hit 100mph but I braked too late. I should have hit the brakes about a second or too earlier and I didn't'. I gave the car a problem it was not going to solve. I feel very disappointed'
With Green's foot flat on the brakes the car rammed into the safety straw bales with great force, smashing in the front of the car.
Andy Green drove the one-off Jaguar too quickly into the corner and skidded across the grass
The car was travelling at 100mph when Green pressed the brake pedal, fractionally too late
The 300,000 supercar ploughed through several strategically placed bales of hay to slow down cars
Jaguar said they were going to assess the extent of the damage on the once-off supercar
Both Green and passenger were wearing sear belts and crash helmets and the car was fitted with a roll bar.
Stewards and medics were on the scene within seconds to evacuate the two occupants.
The specially made one-off Jaguar has a top speed of 174 mph and can accelerate from rest to 60mph in around 4.5 seconds powered by a supercharged 550 bhp 5-litre engine.
It will be the fire support car for Green's 1000mph record attempt next year in the Bloodhound SSC supercar.
The car, pictured, has been specially prepared to support Andy Green's latest land speed record attempt
Unfortunately, Green went into one of the tight corners on the course too fast and lost control
Luckily, neither of the car's occupants were injured after the car came to an unexpected halt
Green already holds the world land speed record of 763mph which he set in 1997 in The supersonic Thrust SSC.
Green, 52, who has flown Phantom and Tornado jets during his career, came a cropper at the notorious Molcombe turn at Goodwood which has caught out many experienced drivers over the years.
Re-running the crash in his mind, Green said later: 'Jaguar are not going to be very happy.
'I had just commented that we were doing 100mph.
I saw the corner coming up. I should have braked earlier. It's a heavier car. I was a second or two too late. The car behaved impeccably. It was 100 per cent my fault.
Andy Green admitted that this was the first crash he has had since his 20s when a tyre blew on an old car
I braked too late. The wheels locked and we came off it became unrecoverable. It was a total cock up on my part.
He said: 'it was dustier and therefore more slippery than I'd expected. I felt very disappointed with myself. I should have done better than that.'
He said that despite his high speed record breaking exploits, this was the first crash he had experienced since his 20s when a tyre blew out on an old car.
A Jaguar spokesman said: 'The car is a one off. It took about 300,000 to develop specifically as a high speed support vehicle for the Bloodhound SSC project. We will assess the damage. The main thing is that no one was hurt.'
A spokesperson for the festival said: 'An incident occurred on Saturday 27, at 1017 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed involving a car on the Hillclimb.
'The car, a Jaguar XKR Bloodhound support vehicle, sustained damage. The driver, Andy Green, and passenger, Ray Massey, were uninjured.
'Two photographers and a TV cameraman were also involved. All three were taken to the nearby medical treatment room for a precautionary check-up, in line with Goodwoods safety protocols, and were released to enjoy the rest of the event.
'Mr Massey was also seen by a doctor.'
RAY MASSEY WRITES FROM THE PASSENGER SEAT OF ANDY GREEN'S CAR
It is amazing how slowly things move in a high speed crash as you hurtle inevitably towards a sickening crunch.
You can see it coming at you in slow motion. But there's nothing you can do about it - especially if you are in the passenger seat and it's the world's fastest man behind the wheel.
It had all started so well. Fans were asking for his autograph, taking photographs and chatting in awe of the quickest man on the planet. Ever the gentleman he obliged every request.
Ray Massey, left, with Andy Green, shortly before jumping into the one-of-a-kind Jaguar supercar
Moments after the high speed impact, Ray Massey, pictured, makes his way safely out of the car
Then the moment for the hill run of just over a mile up the Goodwood hill past the Earl of March's stately home.
We were strapped into the souped up Jaguar XJ Bloodhound SSC support vehicle. Helmets on. Seat belts checked. Roll-bars in place.
As we made our way up the line of Ferrari's, Aston Martins and other supercars we finally reached the start line.
With a screech of tyres and a roar of engine, Andy was off.
The first corner was taken firmly then the car accelerated hard.
'We're hitting a hundred,' he said as the crowd became a blur.
Then the infamous Molcombe corner came in view.
Andy hit the brakes. But too late. A second or two too late, he reckoned afterwards.
He tried to hold the car, but to no avail. Gravity and physics took over.
It was at this point that the world stopped spinning on its axis. Everything slowed dramatically.
I saw the track, then the straw bales. I could only brace and hope the sear belt would do the rest. It felt like counting down fro five to zero before the car hit the bales with almighty crunch. It was one hell of a thump. Straw everywhere. The seatbelt pretensioners pulled me back a bit but the impact was still significant.
Yes, I did feel it.
Within seconds the track marshals were on the scene pulling us out.
You couldn't fault the organisation
Andy Green was calm collected but clearly not a happy man.
And we both walked away from it.
'It was my fault entirely,' he apologised. 'I was going too fast,' he admitted in his disappointment.
Not something you hear every day from the world's fastest man.
But something some day to tell the grandkids.

	It's would be easy to believe it was seven months since Clegg was in Government - but it's only been seven weeks and already he's transformed himself back into a humble  backbencher.

Yesterdays programme was a valedictory affair. Much of it consisted of presenter Nick Ferrari interviewing Mr Clegg but there were a couple of contributions from callers, plus a clip from Ukips Nigel Farage (good grief, this column feels cobwebbed). Old Farage, who is in fact barely 51, felt rather sorry for Mr Clegg and suspected he would have been cheerful not to have retained his Sheffield Hallam constituency. Mr Clegg retorted: There speaks a man who didnt win his seat.
Mr Clegg had to settle a 50 wager with presenter Ferrari (they had bet on the election result, Mr Clegg insisting he would retain his position). He handed over some cash yesterday but it was not clear if that had entirely cleared the debt.
The Lib Dem leadership had realised about ten days before the election that voters were fleeing to the Tories. Yet no one in the Clegg camp had foreseen the size of the defeat. I was pretty blindsided by the exit poll, said Mr Clegg.
Call Clegg: The former Deputy Prime Minister made an appearance on radio with Nick ferrari, left, again this week on LBC where he used to answer questions every week on the show
Nick Clegg insists he has not destroyed his party
His words were peppered by checks and delay mechanisms, kindas and sort ofs and Californian uplifts. Sentences trailed away, left unfinished. Were these signs that he remains disorientated by the loss of high office? He could not remember whom he had first telephoned after the exit poll. And no, he had not reached for a strong drink. I dont sort of go for the bottle at moments like that.
For all this aw-shucks mateyness, the maddening Clegg, the Clegg who so often seemed hypocritical, was not far below the surface. He hoped the Tories would not govern to suit their own party advantage  this from a man who frequently blocked Whitehall reforms to suit the Lib Dems.
I miss taking decisions, said the ex-deputy PM who was a byword for inertia. In reference to child poverty targets, he said it is not acceptable to suddenly change the goalposts to suit yourself. This same Clegg tried to engineer electoral reform for personal advantage and then, in a tantrum, stopped the Tories reducing the number of seats and making constituencies fairer. Oh well.
He said he did not want to sound funereal and he was able to claim  as he always will be  that he helped to create a surprisingly stable government at a time of economic peril.
There was a human interest in this interview. It told us something about the personality of Mr Clegg, proud but tinged by sourness. Finally, did he still play tennis with David Cameron? No! he snapped, the answer coming as fast as an Andy Murray return of service.

	The full extent of the 21-year-old's misfortunes - and the admirable way she handled it - has now been revealed after author Geraldine Roberts spent 10 years researching the life of the heiress.

Shortly after their relationship began, one newspaper mocked the couple with a cartoon titled 'The Disconsolate Sailor or Miss Longing For A Pole'
The couple got married in 1812 in a lavish ceremony that saw the bride wear more than 5million of diamonds and, with their newly-combined fortune, taste for fashion and lifestyle, they were propelled into the limelight.
But William soon showed his darker side with those preferring to gossip in society noting he was hosting an increasing number of parties as well as gambling his wife's fortune.
After their property - Wanstead House - was demolished and sold for scrap, William fled to France and Italy and was joined by Catherine and their three children.
Her wealth and charming manner led her to be pursued by the future William IV (pictured), but she turned him down for William Wellesley Pole
But he soon moved a mistress into the family home in Naples and, when he started to harm his children, Catherine moved them back to the UK.
She later suffered from chest spasms and died in 1825 aged just 35.
Speaking to MailOnline, author Geraldine, 47, said she was aware of Catherine's story living in Wanstead, and wanted to some of the preconceptions about her life for her debut book.
'It was so inspiring and had so many twists and turns - there was also lots of local interest in Wanstead', the Queen Mary graduate, who qualified from a masters in history, said.
'I wanted to overturn a lot of the views around her - I was looking to set the record straight about her.
'Reading her letters I found that she was actually quite remarkable, and not written by someone who was stupid.'

However, the practice of gifting outfits to close friends can result in extremely mutually-agreeable publicity, such as when Amal wore another bespoke Stella McCartney outfit during her Venice wedding celebrations last year.
The all-white ensemble of wide-legged trousers, floppy hat, top and bag made headlines.

And there are times, such as at the 2014 Met Ball in New York, when the association is evidently commercial. Stella took a table at the event  costing 16,000 a plate  and her invited guests, including Rihanna, Reese Witherspoon and Cara Delevingne, acted as ambassadors for her fashion house.
Cara, nice shy girl that she is, posted an Instagram picture of her perfect rear in a pair of rather exclusive skin-tight white pants which had been monogrammed with her name by Stella.
Maccas daughter is a Met Ball aficionado. In previous years, shes invited the likes of actresses Cameron Diaz, Liv Tyler and Salma Hayek to the fundraiser. All turned up in her outfits.

In a role reversal, Stella dresses as a rock star and puts Madonna in a ladylike cream coat (1,220) at the VH1 Fashion awards in 1999
Close friend Gwyneth Paltrow also attended (in guess what?) in 2011. The actress went through a phase of wearing a lot of Stella McCartney when she was living in Belsize Park with Chris Martin.
For several years she and Stella hung out in London with Madonna. Theyd work out in Madonnas home gym with trainer Tracey Anderson every day and Stella even designed the singers stage costumes for a 2004 tour.
But the trio fell out over Madonnas parsimonious insistence that Gwyneth and Stella should pay to use her gym. The Material Girl hasnt been seen in a Stella McCartney dress since.
Another old friend is Kate Moss, who is a face of the Stella McCartney brand and star of its current advertising campaign.
Left -Baywatch hottie Pamela Anderson (in a 1,650 Stella McCartney suit) and the designer at the British Fashion Awards in 2003. Right -Gwyneth Paltrow must have been talked into this Stella McCartney jacket (1,025) and skirt (1,374) at the 2001 VH1 Fashion Awards
Stella, daughter of a Beatle, and Liv Tyler, daughter of Aerosmiths singer, in T-shirts (155) at the Met Gala in 1999
As you might expect, shes quite often seen wearing Stella McCartney clothes  such as the Illusion bodysculpting dress which she wore in 2012.
Theres another designer with a musical past whos never been a friend: Victoria Beckham. In fact, theres talk of a bitchy rivalry.
Not that Stella will care too much  shes well known for a take-no-prisoners briskness in personal dealings.
And of course, her privileged status as the daughter of a Beatle also gave her the ability to network in the celebrity milieu like an absolute pro.

	Draped in state's striped flag, their corpses were carried overhead by weeping relatives ahead of a mass funeral at Kuwait City's Grand Mosque.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>The health ministry said that 40 wounded are still in hospital and the rest have been discharged.
Two of the dead were Iranian, the Shiite-dominated Islamic republic's foreign ministry said.
Friday's attack targeted Al-Imam Al-Sadeq mosque in Kuwait City during Friday noon prayers.
Condolences were being accepted for three days from Saturday at the Grand Mosque, the largest place of worship for Sunni Muslims, in a show of solidarity.
Kuwaiti health officials confirmed that 40 people are still being treated in hospital following the attack
Kuwait declared today a day of mourning to commemorate those murdered by the terror attack
The interior ministry said it has arrested the owner of the car the bomber used to go to the mosque, and that the driver was now being sought.
The vehicle's owner gave it to someone who drove the suicide bomber to the mosque, a ministry statement said.
The ministry said an unspecified number of suspects were held for questioning in connection with the attack that shook the small Gulf state.
No details were provided.
ISIS claimed responsibility for Friday's atrocity which was the worst ever terrorist attack in the country
Thousands of people followed the funeral cortege as the victims were brought to their final resting places
Kuwaiti authorities said they have made several arrests following the deadly terror attack
The government briefed MPs in a joint meeting about measures it has taken after the bombing, Sheikh Mohammad told reporters.
Kuwait's emir, the government, parliament and political groups and clerics have all said the attack aimed to stir up sectarian strife in the emirate.
Sunni religious and political groups were quick to condemn the attack which was claimed by ISIS, a radical Sunni group which considers Shiites to be heretics.
Shiites form a third of Kuwait's 1.3 million native population.
A mass funeral was planned for the victims of the Kuwaiti suicide bombing that killed 27 people on Friday
The bodies of some of those killed in the blast were piled into vehicles by mourning relatives on Saturday
Draped in the state's striped flag, the men's corpses were lifted on stretchers by groups of mourners
The cabinet announced after an emergency meeting on Friday that all security agencies and police had been placed on alert to confront what it called 'black terror'.
Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister Yacoub al-Sane said additional security measures will be taken around mosques and places of worship.
Kuwait declared Saturday to be a day of mourning.
The emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who visited the site immediately after the bombing, said the 'criminal attack is a desperate and evil attempt targeting Kuwait's national unity'.
Members of the parliament joined mourners as they made their way to the cemetery in the west of the city
Most of the victims were buried in a cemetery in the west of Kuwait city following a funeral service today
Countries and organisations including the United Nations and the United States deplored the bombing.
Eight Islamist, liberal and Shiite political groups condemned the attack in a joint statement and called on the government to confront extremists.
National oil conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC) said on Saturday it had raised security at oil facilities to maximum level.
Oil is Kuwait's main source of income, accounting for around 90 per cent of public revenues.
The OPEC member says it sits on around 10 percent of global reserves and pumps around 2.8 million barrels of oil per day.
The mass funeral comes as security sources say numerous arrests have been made in connection with the attack
A weeping man embraced another mourner as they carried the bodies into trucks on Saturday after the violent attack
Today a Kuwaiti security source said a number of people had been arrested in connection with the bombing, the worst in the state for years.
'Numerous arrests of people suspected of having ties with the suicide bomber have been made,' they told Reuters on Saturday.Local newspaper al-Qabas reported the number as three.
Officials previously claimed the attack had been intended to divide Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims across the state, with ISIS a radical strand of Sunni Islam.
Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed al Khaled al Sabah has described the interference as an 'evil hand in our homeland's security.'
Medics and security forces gather inside the Imam Sadiq Mosque attempt to secure the scene following the devastating blast on Friday
Rescue workers carry out one seriously injured man from the mosque attack, where as many as 27 worshipers were killed
Scores of survivors wandered the streets yesterday after the blast, their robes drenched in the blood of those killed and injured in the attack.
Witnesses described the young attacker as having been stood among around 2,000 worshippers before detonating the bomb.
Elsewhere on Friday two Tunisian gunmen slaughtered dozens of holidaymakers on a beach in Sousse.
The men opened fire on tourists in a horrifying attack which killed 15 Britons.
In France a man was decapitated and his head covered in Arabic inscriptions before being impaled on a spike near Grenoble.
Speculation has arisen over whether the three incidents were signs of a lengthy spate of violence launched by ISIS during the month of Ramadan.
Hundreds were injured in the blast which tore through the mosque as men observed Friday prayers

	BBC rewriting Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons is bonkers, TOM UTLEY writes

In the 1930 book, the child heroine was called Titty. In the cleaned-up version made by BBC Films, shes called Tatty.
Now, we can only guess what persuaded the screenplay writers or the Corporations executives to make the change. Did they seriously believe that Titty was too obscene a word to broadcast to an audience of youngsters? Surely not.
More likely, given what we know about the BBC, they thought it might be interpreted as belittling women  and would thereby upset feminists of the sort who spend their lives looking for reasons to be offended.
Another possibility, of course, is that they feared it would prompt childish snickering, which might distract young viewers attention from Ransomes wholesome tale of the outdoor life and derring-do.
But whatever the reason, I was interested to read that the BBC had made the same decision to change Tittys name before. This was for its 1963 television adaptation of Swallows And Amazons  although on that occasion it called her Kitty instead. As it happens, Tatty seems a more academically respectable choice than Kitty, since Ransome apparently based his character on a girl he knew, Mavis Altounyan, who took her nickname Titty from the childrens story, Titty Mouse And Tatty Mouse.
The BBC revealed their plans this week to rename one of the Walker siblings in Swallows And Amazons for its forthcoming adaptation of Arthur Ransomes classic adventure story
But, really, why on earth change the name at all? Back in 1963, the decision may have been just about understandable  at a pinch.
After all, this was two years before the theatre critic Kenneth Tynan earned the dubious (and disputed) distinction of becoming the first person to utter the F-word on TV. And all hell broke loose when he did.
But today? What conceivable point can there be in shielding children from such an innocent little word as Titty, in an age when they are bombarded with genuine filth every day of their lives?
Indeed, it sometimes seems that the F-word, in its various formations, is the only verb, noun or adjective in the vocabulary of many television dramatists, chefs or chat-show hosts and interviewees  while catch-up TV has made the 9pm watershed even less of a safeguard than ever.
Meanwhile, the internet has given todays Swallows And Amazons generation ready access to hardcore porn at its vilest  words and images that belittle, insult and objectify women a thousand times more grievously than any imaginary offence Ransome may have given to the sisterhood.
Yet here is Auntie Beeb  herself the purveyor of her fair share of F-words and X-rated scenes  pursing her lips over the possibility that youngsters may draw some connection between young Miss Walkers nickname and the female breast.
Well, there was always that risk. But then if Auntie is seriously worried that sniggering schoolboys may see sexual references where they are unintended, why doesnt she go the whole hog?
In this spirit of tit for tat, she should perhaps take her blue pencil to Countryfile, instructing its presenters to talk about blue tats, coal tats and great tats.
And what about changing the name of Dick, hero of Enid Blytons Famous Five, to something less likely to raise a puerile chuckle?
Come to that, I notice that Tittys brother remains Roger in the Corporations latest adaptation. Scope for a double-entendre there, surely. As for the former Shadow Chancellor, the BBC could always rename him Ed Bills. (And dont lets even mention P.G. Wodehouses Stiffy Pinker  let alone Ian Flemings Pussy Galore.)
Of course, this was not the first occasion this week when Auntie attracted ridicule for getting her knickers in a twist over a rude-sounding word.
A couple of days before the Titty debate broke out, BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin made a similar fool of herself  insulting her guest into the bargain  when she apologised on air for Alan Titchmarshs use of the words bastard trenching.
As seasoned gardeners will know, this is the traditional term to describe digging a trench to the depth of two spades, to increase soil drainage and aeration.
But to Minchin (or perhaps her bosses, hissing into her earpiece) it was a disgraceful profanity.
We just have to apologise, she said at the end of the interview, for some of the language used in the last couple of minutes.
Affectionate
Poor Titchmarsh (Tatchmarsh) was clearly mortified. Oh no, no, no, no, its a term in a gardening book, he said. I shant repeat it, but its not offensive at all'
Poor Titchmarsh (Tatchmarsh) was clearly mortified. Oh no, no, no, no, its a term in a gardening book, he said. I shant repeat it, but its not offensive at all.
As it happens, people in my trade often use the term bastard measure to describe the width of a line of type when it differs from that of the newspapers standard column. You see it, for example, when type snakes its way round a photograph.
Similarly, I see from the dictionary that the word has many other technical uses, none of them in the least bit pejorative. Bricklayers speak of bastard pointing, botanists of bastard mahogany, toadflax and indigo, while a grey sea turtle is known to marine biologists as the bastard Ridley.
There is surely a simple rule, here, which seems to have escaped the BBC: a word is offensive only when its used in an offensive sense. Thus, bastard is a very rude word when its used to describe someone we dont like  and even more so, when applied deliberately to a person whose parents are unmarried.
In the same way, Titty would indeed be derogatory and offensive if it were applied maliciously to a large-breasted woman.
As an affectionate nickname for a young girl, derived from the name of a mouse in a childrens story, it is utterly inoffensive.
So when BBC executives apologise for Alan Titchmarshs correct use of a gardening term, or change the name of a much-loved character in Swallows And Amazons, theyre not making a stand for decency or the rights of women.
Theyre just proving that, like me, they have dirty minds.
Could we start thinking of ways to protect children from the myriad modern influences that genuinely harm them  and stop fussing about nothing?

A flagship free school in a deprived area has outperformed leading private rivals in the toughest A-level subjects.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the sixth form college  which sent five pupils to Oxbridge  showed that rigorous academic education needn't and shouldn't be the preserve of the rich or lucky.
The London Academy of Excellence in Stratford, East London, had more pupils score highly in two or more difficult A-levels  such as maths, biology, chemistry and history  than Roedean, Marlborough College and Wellington College, which all charge more than 30,000 a year.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) said the sixth form college  which sent five pupils to Oxbridge  showed that rigorous academic education needn't and shouldn't be the preserve of the rich or lucky
Nicky Morgan shares plan to improve 3,500 schools in England
In the schools first A-levels last summer, 39 per cent of pupils achieved two As and a B including at least two tough subjects while Wellington College in Berkshire and Roedean in Brighton had 38 per cent and Wiltshires Marlborough College had 30 per cent.
Seventy-two students from The London Academy, which is in the borough of Newham, went to top universities  compared with 46 in the rest of the boroughs schools combined.
Mrs Morgan said: With teachers and parents in the driving seats, free schools are leading the way in inspiring children from disadvantaged areas to break down barriers and achieve their full potential.
We are opening 500 more free schools this Parliament, underlining our commitment to giving children from all walks of life access to a world-class education.
About 70 per cent of pupils at the free school are from ethnic minorities, mainly Bengali and Pakistani. Languages spoken include Bengali, Urdu and Arabic
About 70 per cent of pupils at the free school are from ethnic minorities, mainly Bengali and Pakistani. Languages spoken include Bengali, Urdu and Arabic.
About 30 per cent of pupils are eligible for free school meals. The school, which opened in 2012, was the brainchild of Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, and is supported by seven independent schools including Eton College, Caterham and Highgate.
Mr Cairns said he had the idea when talking to pupils at Kingsford Community School in Newham, a comprehensive where he is a governor, and sporty children said they wanted to join a football academy.
He said: I thought how wrong it was that those with sporting aspirations had a focus for their ambitions but there was no academy of excellence for those with academic aspirations.

	HMRC failed to answer 18million phone calls from the public last year, with a staggering 10.5million going to answer machine and a further 7.4million terminated by frustrated customers who hung up.

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs revealed last night it had been forced to divert 45million of taxpayers' cash to fix the call centre chaos, which was branded 'woeful' and 'unacceptable' by tax experts. This will pay for 3,000 extra staff, who have been hastily recruited in the past month.
At peak times  including the end of the tax year in March  the taxman missed a third of calls. In January alone, more than a million callers hung up after being forced to wait on the line, which costs up to 40p a minute from mobiles.
Even if calls were answered, some people had to wait 40 minutes to speak to an adviser, experts said last night.
Paul Aplin, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: 'Telephone response times have been getting steadily worse and have reached totally unacceptable levels.
'It took me 40 minutes to get through earlier this week. It's good that HMRC has acknowledged the scale of the problem and that it has allocated 3,000 extra people to the task.
'But it's essential that this resource remains in place long-term. Until we see things improve, customers should look to use the online services instead wherever possible.'
'Woeful': Even if calls were answered, some people had to wait 40 minutes to speak to an adviser, experts said last night (file photo)
Tax expert George Bull, at Baker Tilly, added: 'Anyone who has tried to get through to the HMRC helpline in recent months will be relieved to hear that the department is taking steps to improve its woeful record on call handling.
'However, the problem is not just about getting through, it's also about the quality of the service that's provided. Simply getting more people to man the phones will not necessarily solve this problem.'
Robin Williamson, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: 'These figures will come as no surprise to the many people who have experienced their telephone performance in recent years.
'The phone lines are the only way you can contact HMRC after they closed most of their offices and with a digital system which is still in development. They remain a lifeline if you need to sort out your tax affairs, so the telephone system has to work.
'Waiting times are not uncommonly over half an hour. This can be very expensive for those on pay-as-you-go, which is typically people on lower incomes.' The '03000' number to call the taxman is typically 9p a minute from landlines and between 8p and 40p a minute from mobiles, unless the user has a free calls package, according to Ofcom estimates.
Between April 2014 and March this year, 64.7million calls were made to HMRC, of which 72 per cent (46.8million) were successfully answered. This fell short of the revenue body's target of 80 per cent.
The 45million allocation will come from the current spending budget and is not additional revenue from the Treasury, HMRC said.
Chief executive Lin Homer said: 'Despite our best efforts, our call performance hasn't been up to scratch and we apologise to all those customers who have struggled to get through to us.'
She added that staff numbers had been boosted from 15,000 to 18,000, and another 2,000 workers temporarily drafted in from other roles to deal with the crisis.
Patrick Stevens, at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: 'The fact almost 18million taxpayers could not get through to HMRC last year is alarming.
'HMRC must prioritise customer service so taxpayers aren't disadvantaged by not being able to get through to an adviser.
'We have previously voiced concern that the closure of walk-in inquiry centres would increase the strain on HMRC's call centres.'

And a project to promote safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos, south-east Asia, cost 970.
Humanitarian groups last night said it was important overseas aid spending was concentrated on alleviating poverty.
Diane Sheard, director of the ONE Campaign founded by U2 singer Bono, said: By law, UK aid must help to reduce global poverty. If money is being used to fund schemes that dont meet this goal, then it shouldnt be counted as aid.
Big bite budget:3,104.09 was spent on English lessons for young football players in Urugay, hoping to follow the nation's biting hero Luis Suarez
Shakespeare in love: The FCO spent 5,000 last year on Hamlet education workshops in Ecuador andgave 2,042-worth of free tickets to children for a Hamlet production in Haiti
The reports of Foreign Office aid spending raise legitimate questions.
More than 13,000 was budgeted for a Q&amp;A game show to be shown on Ethiopian television with a UK and Ethiopia theme. A further 5,000 was spent in the African country on a 10k run.
Hundreds of leaflets were printed in Russian and Romanian  at a cost of 2,300  to promote the EU in Moldova.
HEY BIG SPENDER: HOW FOREIGN OFFICE USED YOUR TAXES
Here are just some of the projects on which the Foreign Office spent tax payers' money from their 2013/14 budget.
3,400 was spent on finding female mates for the endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish, in Madagascar.
3,104.09 was spent on Englishlessonsfor youngfootball players inUruguay.
13,888 spent on a Q&amp;A game show on National Televisionin Ethiopia.
51,564 giving Serbians work experience in the UK.
5,000 last year on Hamlet education workshops in Ecuador, South America.
2,042-worth of free tickets given to children for a Hamlet production in Haiti.
And a scheme to find female mates for endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in Madagascar cost 3,400.
Only three of the species, known as gorgeously ugly, were thought to exist in the world in 2013 and all were male.
In Bolivia 13,500 was budgeted for measuring the carbon footprint of the Dakar off-road car rally.
Last night Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: Taxpayers will be outraged at these damning revelations. It is totally inappropriate to spend taxpayers cash on pointless projects and propaganda.
Foreign aid is supposed to help the worlds poorest, not subsidise game shows. Until the Foreign Office can prove value for money for these projects, and theyll struggle, this spending should stop.
The Foreign Office last year spent 343million on overseas aid, while the majority of the UKs 12billion annual aid budget is distributed by the Department for International Development. In March the Government passed a bill to enshrine in law its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of the countrys annual income on aid.
But it has failed to commit to its Nato obligation to spend 2 per cent of its GDP of defence.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: The Foreign Secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCOs aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money. Building closer relationships with growing economies is important.
The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show taxpayers cash is being spent wisely.
The Department for International Development said that it would not be launching a review into its own projects in light of the Foreign Office spending.

Nicola was in Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital for two weeks and needed to take two months off from work to recover from her illness.

Nicola claims the pool area was dirty with murky water and that the food was  served lukewarm and with dirty cutlery.
She added: 'Although I'm now back at work I'm often shaking and tired and I still don't feel normal now ten months on.
'I also have to be careful about my health as my immune system is not that great and so I tend to get ill easily.
'I'm desperate to know what caused my illness as there could be other people affected who might not be as lucky as I was in surviving my condition.'

Amandeep Samra, an expert holiday illness lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are currently investigating the exact cause of Nicola's illness.
'It is extremely worrying to hear how severely ill Nicola became as a result of the illness she suffered.
'She has been through a traumatic experience and continues to suffer as a result of the illness she contracted.
'As we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the Siva Sharm Hotel and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible.'

The mother-of-one, who has edited the British version of the magazine for 23 years, added that she 'doesn't really get' working from home.
She told The Times magazine: 'I think [it] is frustrating for offices. You can't say, "Ooohhh, it's wonderful being away for a year, and now I am going to be away for another year".
'I can't pretend I think that's wonderful. I know I'm meant to...'
The comments were slammed by one parenting group, who said maternity leave 'is part of modern life'.
Rachel Burrows, from the UKs biggest parenting site Netmums, said: 'Ms Shulman raises some interesting points but while they may apply to staff at Vogue magazine, they are less relevant to the normal family.
'The latest figures show the average length of maternity leave is just six months while the average gap between siblings is now three years and eight months - so to suggest women are almost permanently pregnant or on maternity leave is simply wrong.
'Most mothers plan their families according to what they can afford and taking a year of maternity leave is a luxury available only to very few.
'The real issue here is that for many normal families, wages dont cover the cost of childcare, making part-time work with family help for childcare often the only viable option after children.
'Maternity leave is part of modern life so companies need to be wise and embrace what it can bring to improve both the company culture and the bottom line.'

'It's like looking for a green needle in a green haystack, but there are so many people out looking. It's half of Maidstone.'
Heavy-breathing Zombie is thought to have escaped by sneaking through one of Chris' conservatory doors.
Once in his garden, she is thought to slithered through the centre of town before reaching the long-grass 'heaven' beside Tesco.
Zombie - a Coastal Carpet Python - is one of nine pet snakes owned by reptile loving Chris Cini, who has spent the last 24 hours combing grass land to find his beloved pet
Mr Cini's wife Tracy reported Zombie - who feasts on rabbits and rats, bought for her by her owners - missing yesterday
A photo of the constrictor passing by a GP's surgery was posted on Facebook by local woman Sarah Bick.
It is seen with its head held high in the air with it's curving body in the short grass behind.
Mrs Bick uploaded the picture, saying urging the public to 'be careful'.
Kent Police confirmed that a member of the public contacted them to report seeing the snake  in the town's Chaucer Way.
Chris poses holding one of his nine pet snakes. He's now on the hunt for his missing 11-year-old python
Mr Cini's wife Tracy reported Zombie - who feasts on rabbits and rats, bought for her by her owners - missing yesterday.
A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'Our advice for anyone who spots a stray exotic (non-native) snake is to keep a safe distance, monitor the animal and call the RSPCA's Cruelty line.
'Never try to pick up a snake, unless absolutely certain that it has been correctly identified and that it is not venomous.'
To Chris, however, she's a joy to be around.

The footage then jumps back to the beach where two sunbathers in their swimsuits lie slumped on the ground having been caught in the gunfire.
The sun loungers that had been packed earlier in the day are now deserted, some stained with blood.
As the footage returns to the Sousse streets, the sound of gunfire pierces the silence once again and the person filming the video takes refuge behind a wall.
Locals and tourists run down the streets of Sousse as they try to escape the murderous gunman
A holidaymaker in a pair of swimming shorts surveys the scene yesterday during the massacre in Sousse
In the chillingmassacre yesterday a student named as Seifeddine Rezguipulled out a Kalashnikov hidden in a beach parasol and fired bullets at sunbathers lounging on a beachfront resort.
The gunman, who was laughing and joking among the midday bathers, was later shot dead by police after a rampage lasting at least 20 minutes.
Blood soaked bodies in swimsuits were left scattered among upturned sun loungers in what was the deadliest Islamist attack on westerners since the July 7 London bombings in 2005.
At least 39 people, including at least 15 Britons were slaughtered in the attack yesterday claimed by ISIS.
Under the scorching African sun and blue skies, locals and tourists sprint down the street away from gunfire
The government said it expected the number of British casualties to rise. Other casualties included German and Belgian tourists.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said today: 'I expect it (the number of British casualties) to increase. Most of the people were British and there were a large number of British caught up in the shooting.'
Thomson and First Choice today sent 10 planes to evacuate tourists from the Northern African state.
They said several of the people killed and injured were their customers and they were working closely with the local authorities to confirm the exact details of casualties.
Meanwhile Thomas Cook, which has sent an additional plane to the country to help bring home its own tourists, is offering holidaymakers the chance to change or cancel future bookings to Tunisia free of charge.
David Cameron is due to chair a meeting of senior ministers today to discuss the response to the attack in Tunisia.

	France is to pay almost 40 million pounds in compensation to foreign Holocaust victims. The US deal was rubber stamped by MPs on Wednesday night, paving the way for pay-outs around the world.

France has slowly owned up to the part it played in the atrocity, and has already paid out some 40 million pounds to its own nationals affected by it.
Now those who took on new nationalities in countries such as America and Israel will be eligible for money, as will their relatives.
But there was anger at the deal in some quarters, because it is reliant on the United States protecting Frances immunity in regard to Holocaust deportation claims filed in America.
The railway tracks which led to one of the Nazi's most notorious concentration camps, Auschwitz
Rail workers and police were among those who assisted occupying Third Reich forces in deporting some 76,000 Jews during the Second World War, and only around 3000 survived

France is to pay almost 40 million pounds in compensation to foreign victims of its wartime Holocaust. A vote on the bill will be held on July 9 where it is expected to pass.
Former French transport minister Thierry Mariani said: Compensation to victims of the Holocaust is a must but this deal with the USA is humiliating and unacceptable.
Patrick Balkany, an MP whose father was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp from Paris, said: My father would turn in his grave if he knew about this text.
Last month a new complaint was filed in Chicago by Holocaust victim descendants against SNCF.

Former French transport minister Thierry Mariani said: Compensation to victims of the Holocaust is a must but this deal with the USA is humiliating and unacceptable
Such actions have proved extremely problematic for SNCF, as they prevent them winning contracts in the USA. The new deal is ultimately aimed at ending this.
In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a long time campaigner for the compensation deal, hailed the proposed deal as a 'breakthrough in a decades-long struggle for justice.'
The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, also welcomed the accord.
'There is no amount of money that could ever make up for the horrific injustice done to these victims and their families,' said Abraham Foxman, ADL's national director and a Holocaust survivor.
'But agreements like this provide some modest redress, an important recognition of their pain, and acknowledge the responsibility of governments and institutions to leave no stone unturned in seeking every possible measure of justice for Holocaust victims.'

	Damien Dinobewei who strangled Tia Kounota is sent to secure hospital indefinitely

	Unemployed Damien Dinobewei (pictured), of Birmingham, killed on-off girlfriend Tia Kounota when he was in a 'florid' state after stopping taking medication for his paranoid schizophrenia.

Ellis New said: 'The guy wants releasing from custody with all of Tia's friends and family informed of the date and let us decide his punishment.
'He stole a friend, a mother, a daughter, a sister, an aunty and he gets kept in a very comfy secure unit.
'What a joke. Miss you every day, Tia.'
The court heard Miss Kounota had been in a relationship with Dinobewei for several years but he could be 'volatile and controlling towards her'.
Dinobewei (right), of Stirchley, Birmingham, admitted a charge of manslaughter after killing partnerTia Kounota (left)
She was living at a friend's house in Halesowen, West Midlands, when she arranged to meet her lover on July 22 last year.
Prosecutor Mark Heywood told the court neighbours heard screams and saw Dinobewei pushing Miss Kounota into her pink Audi.
He added: 'She saw a muscular man dragging a woman by her hair and punching her repeatedly.
'Tia was screaming very loudly and appeared really distressed.'
The court heard Dinobewei sped off and was spotted at a number of locations as he bought petrol at a garage and drove towards the city centre.
He finally parked the Audi in Erdington, Birmingham, where witnesses saw him get out carrying a petrol can.
It was said in court that firefighters only discovered Miss Kounota's body after they put out the blaze because it had been 'inverted' in the vehicle with her head resting in the foot well
Mr Heywood added: 'He started to do something that they could not clearly see behind the driver's door.
'Moments later the car burst into flames and the defendant made his way off.'
Mr Heywood said firefighters only discovered Miss Kounota's body after they put out the blaze because it had been 'inverted' in the vehicle with her head resting in the foot well.
He said the likely cause of death was blunt force trauma, with compression of the neck, but she may have survived for up to 30 minutes before she died.
David Crigman QC, defending, said: 'They had a row which degenerated into a physical struggle.
'He punched her and held her in the area of the neck. She must have lost consciousness.
'Instead of trying to save her he panicked and drove off and made a crude attempt to save himself.'

	Return of the interest-only mortgage: Fierce competition among lenders is making it easier to take out risky loans

        <MainBody>Interest-only mortgages are becoming available once again thanks to competition among lenders
Interest-only mortgages are becoming easier to take out as a result of fierce competition among lenders.
The potentially-risky loans almost disappeared altogether in 2008 after being blamed for inflating the housing market ahead of the financial crisis.
But lenders have begun introducing deals allowing borrowers to take out an interest-only loan with a deposit of 25 per cent and pay it off when they sell the property, the Times reports.
Interest-only deals, where the borrower only pays off the interest each month and not the capital, were immensely popular prior to the financial crisis because they were cheaper in the short-term.
However they carry significantly higher risks in the long-term as homeowners could see a large hike in their monthly payments down the road.
In 2007 interest-only loans accounted for 33 per cent of the mortgage market but by last year that had fallen to just three per cent according to the council of mortgage lenders.
Now both Barclays/Woolwich and Leeds Building Society have introduced deals allowing borrowers to take out an interest-only loan with a 25 per cent deposit and use the sale of the property to pay it off.
High Street giant Natwest is reportedly considering to offer a similar deal.
Mortgage approvals in Britain reached a 14-month high in May, up around four per cent year-on-year, according to new figures out this week.

Flight tracking data showed the plane make a u-turn over Europe, and head back over the Channel.
The plane was a Boeing 777-200 and had a scheduled land time in Kuwait of 9.25pm (BST).
Al Jazeera have reportedly said the landing was forced due to an outbreak of food poisoning on board.
This has also been declared the reason by Russia Today UK news, who took to Twitter to report it.
Sky's Tom Parmenter told the news channel: 'It is something because of that terror attack in Kuwait yesterday, there is more reason to take note of a Kuwait bound jet turning round over Europe in midair and landing in London.'
On Friday at least 27 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Kuwait when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque.
Islamic State have since declared responsibility for the attack.

Former newsagent Mr Collinge died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage - bleeding on the brain caused by trauma - after the attack on October 8, 2011.
Nottingham Crown Court heard that Collinge had told her friend Jessica Dawkins earlier that day that she 'wanted her husband dead'.
Former newsagent Mr Collinge (pictured) died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage - bleeding on the brain caused by trauma - after the attack in 2011
Closing the prosecution case on Tuesday, prosecutor Peter Joyce QC said his wife stepped over Mr Collinge as he lay dying in a pool of blood.
He added: 'What happens after the killing? What does she [Mrs Collinge] do?
'One is someone with whom she had a sexual thing some years before, Stan Boardman, and the other, her husband, she loves to bits, and he is lying on the floor groaning in a pool of blood. He's dying.
'Does she help him? No. Does she speak to him? No. Does she hold him? No.
'What does she do? She steps over him to go upstairs and she comes back down and she steps over him again. She goes out and she rings her boyfriend.'
Mr Joyce QC said Collinge then went back into the house for a second time but still didn't try to help her dying husband.
He added: 'Does she talk to Cliff? No. Does she hold Cliff? No. Does she cradle him, does she touch him at all? No.
'She steps over him again and she steps over him again on the way outside. She wouldn't have done that to her dog.
'And if it had been her daughter who was attacked by an intruder? Would she have helped her? Yes. Why not Cliff?
'You know why not. She wanted him dead.'
Collinge, Shreeves and Dale, all from Warsop, deny murdering Mr Collinge.
Shreeves and Dale also deny assault causing actual bodily harm to Mr Boardman on the same day.
Giving evidence in the trial, pathologist Dr Guy Rutty said there were at least 46 separate blows or injuries to Mr Collinge.
Mr Joyce QC added: 'You will remember what he was saying about the bones to the head and the fractured skull and the air embolism that killed him.
Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) heard that Collinge had told friend Jessica Dawkins earlier that day that she 'wanted her husband dead'
'Every rib, pretty much, was multiply fractured. There was fracture after fracture consistent with stamping and jumping on him.'
Earlier in the trial, the jury heard Collinge confessed to killing her husband moments after he was bludgeoned to death.
Giving evidence, PCSO Georgina Fletcher told the jury that she arrived at the house shortly after 10pm and saw Mr Collinge lying on the floor in a pool of blood.
She said: 'Charlotte Collinge came from around the back of the house to the window.
'She stepped within a few feet of me and said 'oh my God, I think I've just killed him'.
'She came across as quite nervous. She was a bit jittery as she said it and was crying.
'She went from crying to all of a sudden very straight-faced and very calm.. She said 'I haven't killed him. I found him lying on the floor in blood'..'
But Michael Auty QC, defending Collinge, said under cross-examination that the words could have been 'I think they've killed him'.
He added: 'You made a mistake in what you heard.'
The trial continues.

They need to be careful about this sort of thing.
Another customer spotted the same label in a store in Bedford, this time advertising ham and cheese ciabattas.
Twitter users were shocked by what has been called the insensitivity of the promotional stickers.
Morrisons defended itself, however, claiming that the sticker had been moved.
A spokesperson said: Somebody appears to have moved the sticker before the photo was taken.
We can confirm that the Ramadan sticker is not near any pork products this week.
Morrisons replied to a tweet from a customer, saying: 'I am very sorry for this, we are currently looking into this.'
The embarrassing mistake came just days after Tesco shame-facedly apologised for advertising smokey bacon-flavoured Pringles while wishing shoppers a Happy Ramadan.
Raza Hassan described the mistake, which she spotted in a branch in Liverpool Street, London, as hilarious.
Although the crisps dont actually contain pork, a number of Twitter users were still stunned by the mistake.

'But the thing is children want to reach the end of these games and they won't understand that it costs lots of money.'
Mr Leith, from Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, initially registered his card details on Facebook so that he could occasionally buy apps or games.
After that, every time his son, Alexander, logged on to the account before school he was able to make charges to the card without any verification.
Certain levels of Juice Jam can only be reached if the player has enough 'gold coins' to reach them
These can be bought in packages which cost players between 60p and 63. In Alexander's case, he bought a number of the 63 packages.
Mr Leith said  he is 'furious' with the makers of 'Juice Jam' for making it so easy for children to make purchases.
'It's so easy to spend money on your credit card on Facebook,' he said. 'I've since taken my card details off my profile. You should have to enter a password or security code to make a purchase.'
Mr Leith, who said he had been planning to put the money towards setting up his own business, added that he didn't blame his son 'at all'.
He said: 'It's easily done and he's too young to understand. Because of his autism he gets a bit fixated with games. Very few things can hold his concentration.
'At first we just told him Facebook was broken but he got upset and kept asking to play the game.
'In the end I showed him the invoices and explained to him that the game cost money and daddy couldn't afford. He understood but he was very sad.
'He was only playing it briefly in the mornings before school, it wasn't long enough for me to get charged that extortionate amount.
'I know business is business, but there need to be better safeguards to protect children and the vulnerable.'
A spokeswoman for the game's software developer SGN, said: 'SGN makes games based on the parameters set by the platforms it publishes on including Facebook, iOS, Google Play and Amazon.
'Juice Jam is a free-to-play game, with optional in-app purchases that are not required in order to finish the game.
'The company also handles all customer service inquiries within 24 hours and refunds accidental purchases or unintended transactions when appropriate.
'This particular inquiry from the UK was handled by customer service within 12 hours of receiving, where they were given refund information and advised to increase their Facebook security options.
'SGN is also fully compliant with the Children's Online Protection Act.'
Following a complaint to Facebook, the social network has since offered Mr Leith a one-time only refund.
CAUGHT OUT BY IN-APP CHARGES: FAMILIES WHO FACED MASSIVE BILLS wH
Last August, a mother was left horrified after her son unwittingly racked up a 1,000 bill in just two weeks by playing online games.
Kay Flanders, 49, was stunned to discover that 11-year-old Liam's 10 a month phone bill had rocketed to 850.
He had signed up as a member of online game Small Worlds - where users create their own virtual universes - until 2020.
And, unknown to her, he had bought optional extras such as credits to buy special items and VIP membership which grants exclusive access to other parts of the game.

Meanwhile, in September 2012, a schoolboy unwittingly racked up a 2,000 credit card bill playing an online game on his grandfathers iPad.
Six-year-old Will Smith was innocently playing the popular childrens video game Tiny Monsters until his grandfather Barry Slatter, 55, was contacted by the fraud squad.
The family was unaware of little Wills huge spending spree until his grandmother tried to use the credit card at Tesco, only to have it declined.
Families have also been caught out by in-game charges on a number of mobile phone apps.
In March 2013,eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fryracked up an enormous 980 bill for his parents while playing a Simpsons game on the iPad.

	Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has implied that the final ever show - which will air at 8pm tomorrow - is likely to disappoint the show's fans, as only half the footage is 'quite good'.

'Jeremy is all bombastic and [thinks] he's a brilliant businessman and he knows f*** all,' Mr Wilman, who first met Clarkson when they were students together at Repton school, told the Guardian. 
The BBC decided not to renew Clarkson's contract following an internal review, which found he was responsible for the 'unprovoked physical and verbal attack' on producer Oisin Tymon.
But Top Gear has been dogged by controversies almost since the beginning, the most famous of which include referring to Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot', and to Mexicans as lazy, feckless and flatulent.
The BBC was forced to apologise for the latter following a complaint lodged by the Mexican embassy.
BBC release trailer for final Top Gear episode featuring Clarkson
On form: The final show has been put together using films before Clarkson's contract was not renewed by the BBC, following a 'physical and verbal' attack on a producer in March
Looking to the future: The team are currently in talks with Netflix, ITV and Amazon Prime for the rights to the new show
Controversial: The BBC2 show has been plagued by controversy since it's beginning, including calling Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'
Mr Wilman is less than impressed by the series of offences, describing them as 'abysmal'.
'It was charmless, badly delivered and s***,' he continued.
'If you are making a show with a mental age of nine, you are going to act like a nine-year-old and at some point you are going to lose focus.'
The 75-minute final show will air at 8pm tomorrow night, and is expected to smash the show's current viewer record, of 8.4million.
Final screening: The final episode of the show will air at 8pm tomorrow night, and is expected to smash the show's current viewer record of 8.4million
New deal: But the team will not be able to keep the Top Gear name, as it was bought by the BBC three years ago in a multimillion pound deal that benefited Clarkson and Mr Wilman.
Camaraderie: According to Andy Wilman, the clips used in the final show are not their best, but are strong on camaraderie
The current record-holder is the episode that featured Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton as the 'star in the reasonably-priced' car in 2007.
Prior to that was the episode that featured Richard Hammond's return to the show following his near-fatal crash during filming in September 2006, which drew 8.1million viewers.
But the team are looking to the future, with ITV, Netflix and Amazon Prime currently battling it out for the rights for the new show, which is tipped for success.
Although they will not be able to keep the Top Gear name, as it was bought by the BBC three years in a multimillion pound deal that benefited Clarkson and Mr Wilman.
Chris Evans laughs off claims Clarkson was offered Top Gear job
Take over: The show will be handed over to Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has taken on the roles of both presenter and executive producer
Mr Wilman revealed that the team are now looking for a 'global platform', beyond that of Top Gear's record 350million fans around the world. 
But the original will be handed over to the Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has taken on the roles of presenter and executive producer for next year's return.
Evans is understood to be seeking more audience participation, with open auditions for the co-presenting role and opportunity for viewers to drive around the Top Gear track.
Wilman ended: 'Chris will do a good job of his type of show. It will be a healthy rivalry, there will be room for both of us.'

The young woman has been a patient of a psychiatric institution since she was 21, where she made friends with a fellow suicidal girl, who died from euthanasia 18-months ago. Since
She said: 'Even though my childhood certainly contributed to my suffering, I am convinced that I had had this death wish even though I grew up with a quiet, stable family.'
Laura said she has enjoyed the process of planning her own funeral but admits that her death will be difficult for her grandparents and her mother.
She said: 'When I was six, I was once in a room full of friends where guns were located. I remember I was able to hold one and was given directions. "It allows me to meet my end," I thought. "So it may be easy." I thought then the guns were not loaded, but later I learned that it was. If I had known this at that time, I might have pulled the trigger. I can easily imagine.
Belgium's leading euthanasia doctor Wim Distelmans, pictured, arranged a symposium on the practice in Auschwitz last year
'Death feels to me not as a choice. If I had a choice, I would choose a bearable life, but I have done everything and that was unsuccessful. I played all my life with these thoughts of suicide, I have also done a few attempts. But then there is someone who needs me, and I dont want to hurt anyone. That has always stopped me.
'What Im going to say on that last moment, I do not know yet. I have extensively written ideas in letters to my friends. I think everything has already been appointed. Maybe I will finally figure it out with these words, "Those who are about to die salute you."'
According to the most recent figures, the numbers of people choosing to end their own lives has surged by 27 per cent over the previous 12 months.
Figures showed that in 2013 there were 1,816 cases of euthanasia, compared with 1.432 in 2012. 
Of the total number of cases in 2013, 51.7 per cent were male patients and 48.3 per cent were female.
Elderly people aged between 70 and 90 years made up just over half (53.5 per cent) of the total. Those aged between 60 and 70 years represented 21 per cent and those aged over 90 years seven per cent.
The under-60s accounted for just 15 per cent of the total number of cases.
In 2003 Belgium was the second country in the world to legalise euthanasia after Holland liberalised the law a year earlier, becoming the first country since Nazi Germany to permit the practice.
Over the past decade the numbers of Belgians dying by euthanasia has crept up incrementally.
There was a 25 per cent increase in the number of euthanasia deaths from 2011 to 2012, soaring from 1,133 to 1,432, a figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country.
In February Belgium extended euthanasia to children who are terminally-ill and in a state of unrelieved suffering.
They must also be judged to have capacity of discernment, affirmed by a psychologist, and the consent of their parents before they can die by injection.
Anti-euthanasia campaigners have argued that such safeguards have consistently proved to be meaningless.
They say that besides patients who are gravely ill euthanasia is used increasingly on people with depression or non-terminal conditions.
Those killed include deaf twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, who were granted their wish to die in December 2012 after they learned they would likely to become blind.
Belgium's leading euthanasia doctor Wim Distelmans, pictured, arranged a symposium on the practice in Auschwitz, which attracted major international condemnation. 
Last year Nancy Verhelst, 44, a transsexual, was also killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation, leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a monster.
New figures have shown that five Belgians die with the assistance of doctors each day (pic posed by models)
However, some reports claim that Belgium's liberalised Euthanasia regime has led to some patients being killed without their permission.
An academic report found that around one in every 60 deaths of a patient under GP care involves someone who has not requested euthanasia.
Half of the patients killed without giving their consent were over the age of 80, the study found, and two thirds of them were in hospital and were not suffering from a terminal disease such as cancer.
In about four out of five of the cases, the death was not discussed with patients subjected to involuntary euthanasia because they were either in a coma, they were diagnosed with dementia, or because doctors decided it would not be in their best interests to discuss the matter with them.
Very often doctors would not inform the families of plans to lethally inject a relation because they considered it a medical decision to be made by themselves alone, the report published by the Journal of Medical Ethics said.
The report raised new questions over Belgiums increasingly controversial 13-year-old euthanasia law, which has won wide acceptance from the medical establishment, and which now allows even children to be killed by doctors.
Report author Professor Raphael Cohen-Almagor of Hull University said: The decision as to which life is no longer worth living is not in the hands of the patient but in the hands of the doctor.
It should also be noted that deliberately ending the lives of patients without their request is taking place in Belgium more than in all other countries that document such practices, including the Netherlands.
It is worrying that some physicians take upon themselves the responsibility to deliberately shorten patients lives without a clear indication from the patients that this is what they would want.
The Israeli-born politics and philosophy professor added: The Belgian population should be aware of the present situation and know that if their lives may come to the point where physicians think they are not worth living, in the absence of specific living wills advising physicians what to do then, they might be put to death.
Belgiums Euthanasia Act restricts the practice of mercy killing to adults and emancipated children who are suffering unbearably and who are able to consent. It remains officially illegal for doctors to kill patients who have not given their consent to death.
The study found, however, that many GPs are killing their patients without consent and that lack of consent may be more common than officially-approved deaths.
Given that ending patients lives without request is more common than euthanasia, it is suggested to urge the Belgian medical profession to put this issue high on its agenda, Professor Cohen-Almagor said.

Councillors have unanimously refused a planning application for fracking in Lancashire in a move which has been welcomed by environmental campaigners.
Lancashire County Council's development control committee turned down Cuadrilla's application to explore for shale gas by drilling, hydraulically fracking and testing the flow of gas at Roseacre Wood, Roseacre, between Preston and Blackpool.
The vote was in line with recommendations by planning officials who said it should be turned down because it would cause an increase in traffic which would result in 'an unacceptable impact' on rural roads and reduce road safety.

The committee has yet to reach a decision on a second proposal at Fylde, Lancashire, at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, which planning officers have recommended should go ahead.
The decision on Preston New Road has been deferred to Monday.

Marcus Johnstone, cabinet member for environment, planning and cultural services, and a member of the development control committee, said: 'The development control committee has listened very carefully to many hours of evidence both for and against the proposal, and considered the report of the council's planning officers.
'The decision to refuse this application has been reached by a vote of the committee and each member of the committee has ultimately cast their vote based on the evidence they have heard and whether they think the proposal is acceptable.'
Friends of the Earth welcomed the decision to block the proposed plant at Rosacre Wood
Friends of the Earth north west campaigner Furqan Naeem said: 'This is a tremendous victory for local people and everyone across Lancashire and the UK who have been tirelessly highlighting the risks fracking poses to their quality of life and the climate.
'But the fracking threat still hangs ominously over the community near Preston New Road.
'Poll after poll shows people want renewables, not fracking - and the clean energy and long-term jobs they would provide.
'Lancashire councillors must put local people and our environment first and reject Cuadrilla's controversial application when they meet next Monday.'
In a statement, shale company Cuadrilla said: 'We are disappointed but not surprised that Lancashire County Council's development control committee has denied planning consent for our application at Roseacre Wood as their decision follows a negative recommendation by the council's planning officers.
'We are committed to the responsible exploration and development of the huge quantity of natural gas locked up in the shale rock deep underneath Lancashire.
'We will now take time to consider our options, including our right to appeal.'
Cuadrilla said it was confident that its proposed route, road improvements and traffic management plan were safe and suitable for the modest level of HGV journeys associated with the Roseacre Wood site and met all necessary guidelines.
'If we can unlock this shale gas potential it will help create jobs, generate economic growth, help fuel and heat local businesses and homes, and boost local tax revenues for Lancashire,' the company said.
Footage captures moment massive flames erupt from tank
The Preston New Road planning application remains the focus of hot dispute, with legal advice published today warning that rejecting the application for fracking because of its visual and landscape impacts would be 'unreasonable' in planning terms.
Councillors have been under 'intolerable pressure' in making the final ruling on the controversial process of releasing gas.
The Government has said it is going 'all out for shale', claiming it would create jobs and growth, reduce energy prices and cut the country's reliance on gas imports.
But opponents have raised fears that the process causes earthquakes, can pollute water supplies, could lead to inappropriate development in the countryside and damage house prices.
Environmental campaigners and local opponents of fracking have been protesting outside the council's offices in Preston calling for councillors to reject the two proposals.
Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it.
Greenpeace UK energy and climate campaigner Daisy Sands said: 'Today's decision is a victory for local democracy over corporate arrogance and government meddling, and a shot across the bow of the fracking industry in Lancashire.
'Yesterday we saw local councillors paralysed by fears of a legal challenge from the frackers on a separate application.
'Today the people's elected representatives found their voice again and shouted a very clear 'no' to Cuadrilla's plans.
'Tens of thousands of Lancashire residents will now be hoping that, emboldened by today's decision, the councillors will ignore the enormous pressure from ministers and the fracking lobby, and stop fracking at the Preston New Road site too.'

	Plus-size fashion vlogger Loey Lane takes down critics of fat girls

	Loey Lane, 22, talks about beauty and plus-size fashion on her popular YouTube channel. In a recent video, she came up with a tongue-in-cheek list of reasons why 'fat girls shouldn't wear bikinis'.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
Rocking it: On Instagram, Loey shows off many pieces in her closet - including several two-piece swimsuits
Every body is beautiful: The beauty and fashion vlogger says that people tell her that fat girls don't look good in bikinis - but she begs to differ, and notes that everyone has different tastes
Body-positive: Loey (pictured with her husband) says it's 'bull' to claim that fat girls showing so much skin makes you 'uncomfortable', since the same isn't said about thin girls
'The second thing I'm told a lot is that it makes people uncomfortable... seeing this much skin on a bigger woman makes someone else uncomfortable,' she continued.
Her response to this objection is that one person shouldn't be able to tell another what she can or cannot wear based on their own preferences.
In addition, it seems unreasonable to Loey that only 'fat' women showing skin causes this discomfort.
Thin women are not told to stop wearing whatever they're wearing because it makes someone else uncomfortable.
'Other body types are not told this,' she says. 'Thin women are not told to stop wearing whatever they're wearing because it makes someone else uncomfortable. So I'm gonna call bull on that.
'The third [objection] is that we are promoting obesity. So someone who's plus-size, fat, curvy - whatever you want to call it - if they are in less clothing, we are promoting obesity,' she says with air quotes before adding sarcastically: 'Anyone who is fat and not completely miserable is promoting obesity, by the way.'
Loey is by no means 'promoting obesity', she says. When she wears her bikinis on the beach, she is neither 'shoving her face full of junk food' nor 'screaming at the top of her lungs' that other people should be overweight, too.
She is usually just minding her own business. But that doesn't stop strangers from saying things to her like 'Yo, fatty, lay off the hamburgers'. When she is eating fruit, they'll say things like: 'Oh my god, look at her pretending to be healthy.'
Who asked you? The blonde beauty had been verbally attacked by strangers, who have made mean comments to her at the beach; when she eats fruit, they say things like: 'Look at her pretending to be healthy'
No agenda: Another concern Loey often hears is that heavy girls who show skin are 'promoting obesity'
Do your own thing: Loey criticizes those who take time out of their day to make someone else feel bad with unsolicited vitriol
The final comment she's received regarding her penchant for baring her body 'really, really, really bother me,' she said.
When larger women show skin, Loey said, 'I get told a lot that we're asking for feedback. So that's to justify someone else saying to me, "Hey, that swimsuit looks like shit on you, go work out."'
She explains that this kind of comment is 'genuinely scary' to her. No one is looking for a stranger's approval, she argues.
Even if these plus-size people are sharing images on social media, it's likely because they think 'they look bomb in it', so to tell them otherwise is just cruel.
'That is such a bad and negative thing to do,' Zoey lectures, 'and to waste all of your precious time living such a negative life or having such a crappy outlook, to think that someone else really cares about your opinion... it's scary, it's egotistical, and you mightwant to reevaluate things.'
She then wraps up the body-positive message with a sarcastic revelation that - surprise - none of the objections she listed are credible.
'You know, now, going over this list, I don't really think any of these excuses are valid,' she concludes. 'So does that mean we get to continue wearing what we want?'

Operation Purple Barracuda was a joint sting between South Wales Police and various partners including the National Crime Agency, Cardiff Council and British Transport Police.
It's part of a wider project - Operation Fulcrum - which is a crackdown on drugs trafficking, sex offenders and illegal drivers by police.
Chief Superintendent Belinda Davies said the operation had been a 'complex and sensitive' investigation.
She said: 'Yesterday's police action represents the latest phase of Operation Fulcrum  South Wales Police's commitment to keeping communities across Cardiff safe from organised crime.

'During the course of the operation, 20 people were arrested for an array of offences, including suspected forced labour, money laundering, theft and the large scale abstraction of electricity.
'Suspected proceeds of crime ranging from luxury cars, including a Ferrari and Range Rover, were seized along with a very substantial quantity of cash.
'One of the most critical elements of yesterday's operation, however, was our commitment to protecting British and foreign nationals from suspected forced labour and poor working conditions.'
She added that she hoped the operation would reassure members of the public that the police was committed to tackling organised crime and other forms of criminality in the Welsh capital.
Inspector James Dyson said the swoop was the result of several months of planning and research.
He added: 'To ensure the operation addressed all aspects of criminality, advice was sought from other law enforcement agencies - including the National Crime Agency.
The substantial amount of cash was seized, along with high-value cars from three sites across the city

'A police response such as this will no doubt have an impact on the traveller community within Cardiff and beyond.
'With a view to this, there is an ongoing engagement process with Cardiff Council and the traveller community.
'The policing response was designed to reassure (people) that South Wales Police are there to represent and serve all, and will address any criminality and anti-social behaviour that exists.'
The area's MP Stephen Doughty said: 'I've been in touch with South Wales Police over the past 24 hours regarding these raids.
'These allegations of human trafficking and forced labour are shocking revelations.

'It is vital that the police are able to gather relevant evidence and I would strongly encourage anyone with information to come forward and help the police.'
Mr Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, added: 'There have been a number of revelations of forced labour in Wales and throughout Britain and it is crucial that this barbaric form of modern slavery is dealt with severely.
'It is important that the unfortunate individuals involved are released from these conditions and brought to safety.'

La Compagnie
The all-business class airline, which runs a regular service between Paris and New York and London and New York, is as well known for its stylish uniforms as it is for its unparalleled service.
With a nod to the company's French origins, La Compagnie enlisted the help of Parisian fashion house Vicomte A to design the in-flight styles.

Female crew don chic, yet practical culottes and a Celeste blue silk scarf, while the smart male stewards are clad in a three-piece suit and blue knitted tie.
It's far less formal than one might expect from such an airline - not that we're complaining.
Aeroflot
The Russian national carrier's eye-catching uniforms are as noteworthy for their retro blazers and tilted caps as they are for their bold orange hue.
In 2010, the new uniform was created by Julia Bunakova and Evgeny Khokhlov, two prominent local designers from St. Petersburg.
While the women's uniform comes in a chic dark blue colour, as well, specifically for the winter months - it's their red tangerine summer offering that tops our best-dressed flight crew list.

The uniform was crafted by Julia Bunakova and Evgeny Khokhlov, two prominent St Petersburg designers, in 2010
We're not the only ones who think so.
In 2013, the Aeroflot cabin uniform was voted to be the most stylish in Europe in a survey organised by global travel search site, Skyscanner.
And with white gloves and neckties that hark back to the golden age of flying, passengers just might feel as though they've transported back to the swinging Sixties when they step on board.
Emirates
Emirates is home to some of the most sophisticated uniforms in the business.
But instead of sourcing out the designs to an internationally renowned fashion house, the airline decided to employ British designer Simon Jersey, a longtime leader in corporate clothing.
First introduced in 2009 - and using colours and fabrics that mirror the elegance of the brand - the new uniforms simply improve upon the look and comfort of yesteryear's designs.

For men, a rich chocolate coloured suit with a subtle cream and red pinstripe was chosen. Women, on the other hand, wear an elegant mushroom coloured suit with a matching chocolate and red pinstripe pattern.
A cream blouse is worn by both cabin crew and pursers and an inverted pleat on the skirts offer a flash of red when the female flight attendants walk by.
But its the headwear - the signature red hat and white scarf - that is the crew's best accessory, also offering a nod to the Dubai-based brand's culture and history.
Air France
Crafted by Christian Lacroix, Air France's uniforms have long been considered to be one of the most unique in the air.
With a long history of working with top designers, the airline has previously contracted Balenciaga and Dior in the 1960s.
However, the latest Air France incarnation, which was introduced in 2005, may be the best yet, asLacroix's now-signature red gloves and sculptural red bow-tie belts perfectly accent the navy blue theme colour.

Rather than help, his friends stood laughing as Mr Sayers spent 10 minutes struggling in vain to wrestle his head free.

Mr Sayers, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, told MailOnline: 'I'd had about 12 or 13 cans over about eight hours and was in a bit of a silly mood.
'Throughout the day I'd been throwing my clubs round, because that's what I often end up doing, and a couple of them were bent so at the end I said "right, these are going in the bin".

'But when they wouldn't fit everybody started laughing so I thought, right, I'm going to stick my head in there instead, that'll get a laugh.
'So I shoved my head in the bin. It wouldn't go in at first and then as I gave it a big push and forced it I knew straight away I was in trouble. I tried to pull it out again but my ears got stuck.
'Well then everybody was in hysterics. I've got my wife and kids there - and my mother - and they're all laughing their heads off at my stupid predicament.' 
He added: 'I was stuck like that for about 10 minutes until someone who had been carrying Vaseline to avoid sores during the golf day helped get my head out.

But the following year brought relief for the 55-year-old mother-of-two, when Andy finally took the title after defeating Serbian Novak Djokovic in the final.
'Of course I was happy, but mainly relieved, because of everything we had experienced over the years,' she continued.
The 28-year-old is looking good this year to reclaim his title from Djokovic, after winning his fourth Queen's Club title and reaching the semi-finals of the French Open at the beginning of this month.

The tennis ace has credited his new martial status for boosting his game, after marrying 27-year-old Kim Sears.
But Judy thinks the improvement in his game is down to his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, after Andy split last year from the more 'aggressive' trainer Ivan Lendl.
She thinks that Ms Mauresmo has helped develop a more feminine and intuitive side to his game, describing her as a 'smart tactician'.

Murray has previously said he is 'a tough guy to beat', but has defeated him in both of their previous clashes.

	George Osborne urged to use first Tory budget to slash the 45p top rate of tax

	Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said the 45p rate should be abolished altogether – claiming it would attract business to Britain and cost the Exchequer little in lost revenues.

In the run up to the election, the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to rule out scrapping the higher rate.
He said cutting the top rate of tax was not in his 'plan', but refused to rule it out.
According to the Financial Times, Mr Osborne has 'indicated in Treasury meetings that he might cut the 45p tax rate on earnings above 150,000'.
Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said the 45p rate should be abolished altogether
But Lord Lawson has urged Mr Osborne to make the move. The Tory peer said he would 'strongly support' any cut, adding that it would 'significantly enhance the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business, at no cost in terms of lost revenue'.
He told the Financial Times: 'That was the experience when I brought the top rate down to 40 per cent in 1988 and it is even more relevant today.'
The move would be welcomed in the City of London, where banks have complained about high taxes.
Labour increased the rate from 40p to 50p in 2009 after the financial crash, and Mr Osborne cut it to 45p in his 2012 Budget.
The Conservatives have already promised to cut pension tax relief for the highest earners and Mr Osborne is also expected to announce a 5billion crackdown on tax avoidance.
He will also use the Budget to raise the income tax threshold for those on low earnings and to make progress towards a 50,000 starting rate for the current 40p rate.
When the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling announced plans to introduce a 50p income tax rate on incomes above 150,000 from 2010-11, it was originally estimated to increase tax revenues by 2.7 billion a year.
But Mr Osborne commissioned HMRC to analyse the 2010-11 tax returns to assess how much extra tax had actually been raised. It estimated that the 50p rate brought in 1bn more than the 40p rate.
Cutting the rate back to 45p was estimated to cost 100m, suggesting that reducing it to 40p would cost at least 900,000.
The estimates of the cost of reducing the top tax rate are subject to large margins of errors.

Elaine Michelle Smith - who posted the pictures onto Facebook in the first place said she spotted them on Thursday.
She wrote: 'Love the new signs posted on the alleyway near Harwood meadows school that someone's put up - let's hope people take notice.'
Brad Latham-Holt added: 'Haha brilliant, it is like a minefield along that path - minging.'
Grammar fan Pauline Bateson astutely commented: 'If they are ignorant enough to let their pooches poo, they won't know the difference between too and to.'
Dog owner Joanne Davies blasted: 'I've only had my dog for 12 months and always pick up but I can't believe how lazy some dog owners are.
One of the signs mocks the pet owners by saying: 'The Poo fairy doesn't live here...Scoop your Poop'
'It's not difficult to pick it up &amp; carry it home. Unfortunately this is not just a problem in Bolton.
'It does seem to be cleaner in areas that have more bins so come on Bolton Council give us a bit of support.'
Anna Carlin chimed in: 'They should put these up for horse poo too. Ridiculous how much poo is over the streets.'
But poster Ms Smith pointed out: 'At least you can put that on your roses!'
Jackie Greenhalgh added: 'Thank god! It's disgusting in the morning.'
Last January cash-strapped Bolton Council revealed their dog mess bins were actualy being 'phased out' - instead urging owners to used regular litter bins, or take the mess home.
Joanna Davis communicated her frustration at what she branded 'lazy' dog walkers on Facebook
Local woman Lyndsey Leatherbarrow said the onus was now on the council to take more action
Facebook user Niomi Stanley has admitted that she goes as far as taking a different route just to avoid the excessive dog mess
Council chiefs said budget restrictions mean they are currently unable to install new litter bins or dog waste bins.
Yet at the same time it was revealed incidents of fly-tipping went up by 40 per cent last year, with 4,000 reports across Bolton.
The council said it has been phasing out dog waste bins for the past five years - with the authority describing the cost of maintenance of the bins and disposal of the waste as 'prohibitive'.
Waste collected in dog bins is classed as clinical waste and must be disposed of by incineration.
Just because there is not a bin near you does not mean you should drop it on the floor. There is no excuse for that - either take it home or find another bin.
Councillor Nick Peel
The council's cabinet member for the environment, Cllr Nick Peel said that while there was no 'dedicated budget' for new litter bins.
Cllr Peel said: 'Just because there is not a bin near you does not mean you should drop it on the floor.
'There is no excuse for that - either take it home or find another bin.
'When people are putting dog waste in the litter bins it should obviously be properly bagged and if the bin is too full then people should find another one or take it to their bin at home.'
A spokesman for Bolton Council said: 'Due to budget restrictions, we are unable to install both new litter bins and new dog waste bins at the current time.
'With regards to dog waste bins, we have been phasing these out over the past five years.
'Instead we encourage the public and dog walkers to put their dog waste into any litter bin and it will be collected along with the rest of the litter.
'If a resident does have a particular issue with dog waste in their area, we would advise them to contact the contact centre and our Education and Enforcement team will be in touch to discuss the issue.'

The government boasted that poverty levels remained at the lowest level since the 1980s.
But in the Commons,Labour MP David Winnick said: 'If the situation has improved substantially why has there been such a large amount of food banks, far larger than previously?
'Isn't it quite clear that some Tory members have no idea at all of the amount of poverty which exists, in many cases in their own constituencies?'
Earlier the SNP's Ian Blackford said: 'Is it not a disgrace that in my own constituency the biggest increase in food bank use has come from those who are in work?'
I welcome decent people in society trying to help others who may, for various reasons, have fallen into difficulty
Iain Duncan Smith
Mr Duncan Smith said he had no problem with the increased use of food banks: 'Most of my colleagues are usually involved with food banks and actually help them.
'I welcome food banks. I welcome decent people in society trying to help others who may, for various reasons, have fallen into difficulty.
'I don't accept the single cause of that is to do with the welfare reforms, quite the contrary.
'Food bank usage has been rising over a period. It was never part of the British system, but in Germany where their welfare payments you can argue are higher, 1.5 million a week use food banks, much more than they do here.'
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said:'It's small wonder that Iain Duncan Smith is a fan of food banks  his polices are keeping them in business.
'If he spent more time visiting food banks he would see for himself that many users are in work, as well those punished by his cruel sanctions regime. Slashing tax credits for the working poor will only make things worse.'
Senior Conservatives have repeatedly faced criticism for their attitude towards food banks.
But Lord Freud said the rise in demand for food banks was difficult to understand., adding 'it is very hard to know why people go to them'.
Ministers have previously argued that an increase in the number of food banks has been fuelled by Jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help
Two years ago Cabinet minister Michael Gove was branded an 'absolute disgrace' by Labour after claiming families who use food banks have only their own 'decisions' to blame.
He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.
He added: 'I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.
'Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances.
If the situation has improved substantially why has there been such a large amount of food banks, far larger than previously?
Labour MP David Winnick
'We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.'
Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit has also claimed that people who use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, blaming a 'near infinite demand' for anything free.
Last year the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger in the UK found that, since the establishment of the Trussell Trust network in 2004, numbers of emergency food assistance providers have grown to at least 1,500, including 800 food banks - around half of them operated by the Trust.
Its major report, Feeding Britain, found there that 'demand for emergency food assistance is increasing, and sometimes increasing dramatically'.
But Tory peer Baroness Jenkin of Kennington faced criticised after she suggested that a lack of cookery skills was in part to blame for families going to food banks, and boasted she ate a bowl of porridge for 4p for breakfast.

Toms shoes founder Blake Mycoskie has called for all new fathers to receive three months paternity leave.
His comments come after he gave himself 12 weeks off following the birth of his six-month-old son, Summit.
The shoe company entrepreneur offers all new parents at his firm eight weeks paid leave and flexible schedules after they return to work.
Now he wants more businesses across America to support new fathers.
'It's an experience I wish every new dad could have, but I realize how lucky I am,' Mr Mycoskie told Glamour .
'In fact, when I announced I'd be taking leave, some of my CEO peers were mystified.
'Responses ranged from 'You're going to get real bored, real quick' to 'How are you supposed to lead a company while changing diapers?'
According to Mycoskie, just 12 per cent of all workers in America have access to formal paid parental leave and most men take just a week off after the birth of their children.
But the businessman says rather than being a burden on the workplace, bosses should think of it as an investment.
'What may look like a cost on the spread sheets, actually is an investment in higher productivity and more engagement,' he told the Today Show .

	Spearfisher Valentine Thomas reveals the abuse she receives for the sport she loves

	In her spare time, City worker Valentine Thomas (pictured), 28, who moved from Canada to London five years ago, swaps a suit for a snorkel and travels the world in search of another big catch.

'People call me a killer,' Miss Thomas told MailOnline. 'I face sexism, I face a lot of hate, but I have also had marriage proposals.'
In 2010, the French-speaking Canadian moved from Montreal to the UK, and was persuaded by a friend to complete a diving course in Egypt.
She then travelled to the remote Ascension Island in the south Atlantic for her first trip and soon fell in love with the sport.
'For me to be able to grab my own food is amazing,' the keen cook explained. 'I like everything - even cleaning the fish afterwards. We are really involved in sea preservation. We never kill anything we won't eat.'
Amazing: Valentine Thomas encounters huge whale shark
Backlash: Valentine is a successful sportswoman who became a record holder in 2013 on Ascension Island
Haul: The keen cook has been criticised for spearfishing but insists she never kills anything she doesn't eat
World record: Valentine pictured with the huge Atlantic Jack which made her a world record holder in 2013
Criticism: Valentine documents her travels on social media but has faced strong backlash with some calling her a killer
It was on her first fishing expedition that Miss Thomas almost died when she became separated from her partner in high waves.
'I started freaking out,' she said. 'I was trying to swim to the shore and I couldn't.
Sometimes you can be five miles from the shore. When you spear a fish and there is blood everywhere, the sharks are around
'Sometimes you can be five miles from the shore. When you spear a fish and there is blood everywhere, the sharks are around.'
Miss Thomas, who works in the City raising capital for a hedge fund, was lucky on this occasion and found a rope connected to her partner so she could pull herself to safety.
She has travelled to the island in the Atlantic on numerous occasions to indulge her passion, as well as to Durban in South Africa where she swam into a school of between 20 and 30 sharks, Corsica and Greece.
She has also fished off the Channel Islands, Dorset and Cornwall.
In 2013, she broke the  world record for catching the largest Atlantic Jack while diving off Ascension Island.
As a woman taking part in a male-dominated sport, Miss Thomas benefits from free equipment from sponsors and trip invites, but she is also bombarded with abuse.
Hobby: The 28-year-old went to Ascension Island for her first spearfishing trip four years ago but almost died
Deadly: Risks Valentine faces are strong currents and sharks, like this one spotted while she was fishing in South Africa
Future: The world-record holder, who works in the City, hopes to make spearfishing her full-time occupation
Next trip: The sportswoman will be travelling to Zanzibar for two weeks in the summer where she hopes to bag a new world record
Travel: Fishing has allowed her to travel to exotic locations around the world. This photo was taken in Corsica
One of her pictures was recently shared on an Instagram account called Spear Sluts - a page featuring beautiful, bikini-clad women fishing.
Some question whether she actually catches the fish she poses with, suggesting her boyfriend is responsible.
'It's extremely rare to see women, actually,' she said. 'It's really something quite different. It used to bother me - it definitely bothers my boyfriend. People don't believe I can do things like this.'
She concedes: 'It's the good and the bad publicity. I don't think I have ever bought any equipment.'
And Miss Thomas is often called a killer on social media, but she insists her way of fishing is far more humane that using a net.
Some pictures show her gutting her catches - prompting critics to call on her to stop. One  described her on Facebook as Jack the Ripper.
'I shoot them in the brain and they die immediately,' she said. 'I'm very respectful of everything I do.
'If you buy fish from a supermarket, why am I the bad guy? People see blood and they get squeamish.
'People get really angry, they get  upset because they are not used to seeing where their food comes from. Everyone turns a blind eye to what they are eating and I put the reality in front of them.'
Humane: Valentine, 28, insists the way she kills the fish is far more humane than catching them in a net
Getting her hands dirty: The 28-year-old not only kills fish but guts, cleans and cooks her catches before eating them
Doubt: Some question whether she catches the fish she poses with, suggesting her boyfriend is responsible
Miss Thomas believes she got her adventurous streak from her father, Alain, who sailed across the Atlantic when he was in his 20s.
He taught her to dive and fish when she was a child, but she had to overcome her fears to pursue her passion.
Now it's getting harder and harder to go back to the office on Monday and go on the computer
'It took me quite a while before being comfortable with shore diving,' Miss Thomas wrote on social media.
'I almost drowned in the south west of France when I was a teenager after being caught in an underwater current.
'Spearfishing allowed me to overcome my fear of the ocean which got replaced with passion, but it was a long road to get there.'
In July, she will visit Zanzibar off the east coast of Africa for two weeks where she hopes to bag a new world record.
She has already featured in two French television documentaries about fishing but has far bigger ambitions.
'My dream would be to make a TV show so I can fish for a living and I would like to get involved in protecting the ocean,' she said.'Now it's getting harder and harder to go back to the office on Monday and go on the computer.'

Looking forward: She hopes to leave her job in the City and make a television show so she can fish every day

	ITV's News At Ten to replace Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham with Tom Bradby
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3138874/News-Ten-presenters-war-ITV-plans-ditch-current-line-up.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490

        <Description>
	Tom Bradby, currently the channel's political editor, was today revealed as the new presenter of the flagship primetime news programme.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
A source told The Sun there was 'mutiny in the ranks' over the changes, adding: 'Colleagues are either Team Mark or Team Tom. Some don't understand why a change is necessary.'
Earlier this month, another insider told the Guardian: 'If it ain't broke why fix it?'
Disgruntled: Current presenters Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham are said to be unhappy at the move
However, Mr Bradby has apparently been singled out as the 'future face of news' for ITV - a source recently told the Daily Mail he would be 'our new Trevor McDonald'.
The experienced journalist was the first person to interview Prince William and Kate Middleton after they got engaged in 2010, on the specific request of the Prince.
It was Mr Bradby who sparked the News of the World phone-hacking scandal in 2005, when he told police that a reporter had listened in on messages exchanged between him and William.
More recently, he became an unlikely hate figure in the US when American Twitter users confused him with top NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who has been suspended for misconduct.
Legacy: News at Ten was previously hosted by Sir Trevor MacDonald, pictured on screen in 2000
Mr Bradby said in a statement today: 'News at Ten is one of the best known and loved news brands in the country and I have hugely enjoyed working for it in 25 years on the road with ITV News.
'The chance to help lead it into a new era is a unique and incredibly exciting challenge - and, given the programme's heritage, a great honour, too.'
Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs, added: 'ITV News is fortunate to have an exceptionally talented line-up of experienced and knowledgeable newscasters. They bring vast reporting and presenting experience to our programmes and their journalism enhances all our news output.
'I'm delighted Tom is joining our very strong and well established presenting line-up. His expert knowledge of British politics and international affairs will be very valuable as we develop News at Ten.'
WAR REPORTER, ROYAL EXPERT, POLITICAL STAR... NOW THE FACE OF ITV
Tom Bradby is poised to become the public face of ITV after a storied career as a war correspondent, royal reporter and now political specialist.
The 48-year-old was born in Malta while his father was serving as an officer in the Royal Navy, and was educated at Sherborne School, alma mater to Coldplay's Chris Martin and actor Jeremy Irons.
After studying at Edinburgh University, he joined ITN as a graduate trainee 1990 - and 25 years later, he has still never worked anywhere else.
Mr Bradby spent three years as Ireland correspondent, then moved his young family to Hong Kong as ITV's Asia correspondent - almost costing him his leg when he was shot during a protest in Indonesia.
Friends: Mr Bradby was the first person to interview Prince William and Kate Middleton together
In 2001, he reluctantly accepted the job of royal correspondent because it was the only post available in London - but he soon developed a reputation as one of the closest confidants to the next generation of royals.
After accompanying Prince Harry on his gap year in Lesotho, he struck up a friendship with Prince William, and was the first person to interview William and Kate Middleton when they got engaged.
He also found himself dragged in to what would become the phone hacking scandal, when it emerged that a News of the World journalist had intercepted voicemail messages between him and the prince.
Mr Bradby was appointed political editor in 2005, despite not having a political background - which he claims is an advantage because neither side can accuse him of bias.
He is host of the political chat show The Agenda, and last month was the lead anchor on ITV's coverage of the General Election.
Now the presenter - who has three children with his wife Claudia - is likely to become one of the most prominent journalists in the country if, as predicted, he takes over News at Ten.

	Police attend Bradford after Facebook post calling the niqab offensive is shared

	A photo of three women in niqabs with the message ‘share if you find this offensive’ was seen on the Facebook page of a member of a Bradford's school’s support staff and reported.
      </Description>

The Facebook post originated from Britain First  the right wing political movement reportedly founded by a former member of the British Nationalist Party  and was allegedly shared by Angie Dunn, a non-teaching member of staff at the Bradford comprehensive.
However, police are also looking into a complaint from Ms Dunn that her Facebook account was maliciously hacked.
The secondary school has around 1,000 pupils aged from 11 to 18.
Response: The headteacher has maintained that calling the police in over the alleged anti-niqab post was the right thing to do
According to a recent Ofsted report the vast majority of students are from minority ethnic backgrounds and speak English as an additional language.
When news of the anti-Islamic social media photo spread through the school it clearly provoked anger amongst pupils and parents demanding action.
Mrs McIntosh, the headteacher, said: We have dealt with this matter swiftly and informed the police right away. It will now be investigated in the proper way and will be dealt with accordingly.
We will not allow any isolated incident to distract from our focus on delivering a high quality education to all our students, as a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment for the whole community.
In a letter to parents, she added: You may be aware of the tasteless and offensive Facebook post regarding the hijab allegedly posted by a member of staff.
This appalling action in no way represents the thoughts, feelings or actions of Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and the 207 other individuals who work here.
Prejudice and racism in any form is not acceptable in or out of our college and any such behaviour is taken very seriously. That is why the matter has been reported to the police for investigation as a hate crime.
A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said they were contacted on Wednesday morning by a member of staff at the school about an inappropriate picture which had been shared on their social media page. He said: Enquiries are continuing into this matter.
Councillor Mohammed Shafiq said he had ten calls in an hour from worried parents.
He said: Im pleased that the school has launched a full investigation to look into this matter and the priority remains the education of our children.
While Brian Morris, a local UKIP councillor, warned of an overreaction.
He said: It's the times we live in unfortunately. No matter how the post was meant to be seen, people will take it as offensive even if that wasn't the intention.
There are people out there looking for problems and the slightest little thing they can get hold of they will. People will twist things and make a bigger issue out of it.
Councillor Susan Hinchclifffe, Bradford Councils executive member for schools, said the authority would not tolerate any instance of prejudice, in any shape or form.
It is not known if any action has been taken against Ms Dunn, a member of the learning support staff.
Laisterdyke hit the headlines in April last year when the governors were removed following a critical Ofsted report and concerns raised by the council. They were accused of undermining the head and interfering in the day-to-day running of the school.
It was revealed how teachers had previously been suspended after clashing with governors who wanted to model the school on the academy in Birmingham at the centre of the 'Trojan Horse' allegations.

Defence:West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes says the force has come a long way since the report was written
Half of all victims, who were from Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall, lived with their parents, while 41 per cent were in care.
Police pin-pointed 75 grooming suspects - most with a history of sexual violence - with most being from a Muslim background from Birmingham.
The report stated: 'The vast majority of identified suspects (79 per cent) are Asian (59 of 75), 12 per cent are white and five per cent are African Caribbean. 62 per cent of Asian suspects are of Pakistani origin.
'Pakistani males account for half of all identified suspects in the force (37 of 75).
'Offenders are likely to have a history of previous sexual offences, as well as a wide range of other offences and convictions.
'A high level of organised criminality has now been evidenced both across the force area and regionally, with multiple offenders working together to identify, groom and abuse victims.
'In a number of organised groups victims are forced into prostitution and high levels of intimidation and force are used to keep the victims compliant.'
Concerns: The report speaks of an upcoming English Defence League march through Dudley a month later, which saw streets emptied and shops boarded up
The shocking document also highlighted fears of 'community tensions' if the police made the report's findings public.
HOW WEST MIDLANDS REPORT HAS SHADES OF ROTHERHAM SCANDAL
West Midlands Police's decision to withhold details of alleged child abuse amid fears of increasing racial tensions has shades of the scandal in Rotherham.
Police and social workers in the South Yorkshire town were accused of being too concerned about being labelled racist to speak out about the crimes involving 1,400 children.
Yesterday it emerged that the massive inquiry into the Rotherham sex abuse scandal could run until at least 2018 and has so far identified 300 suspects.
Investigators say the number of possible offenders is changing on a daily basis and they suspect thousands of offences have been committed.
The team has seized 92 boxes containing several thousand files and identified more than 3,300 lines of inquiry. The suspects are predominantly Asian men from the South Yorkshire town and include two who have worked for the council. Their victims are mainly white, British, underage and vulnerable girls.
Operation Stovewood is currently costing up to 5million every year, and is still likely to be ongoing in three years time  putting the total bill for the inquiry at around 15million.
So far the inquiry has backed an original estimate that 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham during a 16-year period from 1997 to 2013.
Last night childrens charities demanded that the men should be brought to justice.
Barnardos chief executive Javed Khan said: Because so many vulnerable children were ignored by the authorities, groomers got away with exploiting them for years.
Ensuring the cases against groomers go to trial is vital in giving sexually exploited children confidence that the justice system does work for them; that if they come forward, they will be believed and supported'.
It stated: 'The predominant offender profile of Pakistani Muslim males... combined with the predominant victim profile of white females has the potential to cause significant community tensions.
'There is a potential for a backlash against the vast majority of law abiding citizens from Asian/Pakistani communities from other members of the community believing their children have been exploited.
'These factors, combined with an EDL protest in Dudley in April and a General Election in May could notably increase community tension.
'Police will be criticised if it appears we have not safeguarded vulnerable children, investigated offences and prosecuted offenders.'
The lengthy report concluded authorities in the West Midlands needed to improve its care of missing care home children.
It stated: 'There is strong evidence in the vast majority of all cases that the victims are enticed, stupefied or controlled by alcohol and a mixture of controlled drugs.
'The victims are already suffering from health conditions relating to their chaotic lifestyle and exploitation (Pregnancy, termination, STDs, neglect, and physical and psychological problems).'
West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: 'These reports, spanning six years, give a real insight into the journey we have undertaken along with our partners into investigating and tackling child sexual exploitation.
'There is no doubt that there has been a significant cultural change within the force in respect of this issue and it is now very clear that the responsibility of tackling CSE (child sexual exploitation) lies with every police officer, staff member, PCSO and special constable.
'The force has carried out extensive work to train officers across the force in how to identify and deal with CSE so we can gain as much intelligence as possible and thereby improving the outcomes for victims.
'We continue to take great steps and as a result of our efforts and without doubt the coverage within local and national media, we are seeing more victims coming forward to report abuse, knowing we will take their allegations seriously and treat them sensitively and respectfully.'

	Vince Brown, pictured, helped ground worker Tom Lofus after he noticed he was in distress when their cars were stopped next to each other on the M62 between Liverpool and Manchester.

'We owe Vince a huge debt of gratitude, what he did was priceless and he did it without a second thought. We can't thank him enough.
'It might seem like only a small thing but people are reluctant to help strangers out now.'
Mr Lofus and Mr Bolam were driving their van back from a job in Liverpool when Mr Lofus began feeling ill.
'Usually Tom has his medication with him but we'd left in such a rush he had forgotten it,' said Mr Bolam. 'Then the heat of the day had taken its toll on him too and was making it worse.
We owe Vince a huge debt of gratitude, what he did was priceless and he did it without a second thought. We can't thank him enough. It might seem like only a small thing but people are reluctant to help strangers out now
'We thought if we got him home he would be fine but once we were stuck in traffic he really took a funny turn and we knew it was serious.'
Mr Brown had been stuck on the stretch of road for two hours when he spotted Mr Lofus in distress.
Since the traffic was at a standstill, he got out of his van to see if he could help.
He offered Mr Lofus two cereal bars and a Cadbury's Brunch chocolate bar that he had brought along for himself. Moments later, he returned and gave Mr Lofus three bottles of water.
Mr Bolam, who lives in Bury, Greater Manchester, said: 'What impressed us most is that Vince wasn't looking for praise or thanks, he just did it out of the goodness of his heart.
'He is obviously just the kind of guy who is happy to help out where he can - and we really needed it in this instance, or who knows what might have happened to Tom.'
In recognition of Mr Brown's kindness, Mr Bolam uploaded a post about his actions to Facebook. It has now been shared more than 21,000 times and has more than 45,000 'likes'.
Mr Brown said: 'I've been completely overwhelmed by the response. I don't consider it a big act of kindness, it's just something I would do for anyone really.
Internet sensation:In recognition of Mr Brown's kindness, Mr Bolam uploaded a post about his actions to Facebook. It has now been shared more than 21,000 times and has more than 45,000 'likes'
'I have stopped my van before when I've seen people broken down and offered them a drink or an apple and so on in case they have been stranded a while.
'I think it's important to offer help when you can.'
The driver, who recently celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary, has worked for DHL driving exclusively for Iceland for 15 years.
Nick Canning, Joint Managing Director at Iceland said: 'We pride ourselves on providing an excellent service - wherever we are!
'And this is exactly the kind of upstanding behaviour we encourage from any member of the Iceland family. We want to congratulate Vince for being such a hero.'
After seeing the post online, a number of social media users shared their memories of Mr Brown being kind and helping them.
Julie Williams said: 'Vince is a lovely man, l remember him from when l worked at Iceland, and this doesn't surprise me.'
Jody Bate said: 'He's a dude. Always make him a hot drink when he calls at our store and he's always ready to chat and willing to help. Good on ya Vince.'
Sirah Younis said: 'I've only met this driver a couple of times when he delivered to our store and he was really nice! Well done to him!'
Paul Bayliss said: 'Vince is a true hero, his act of kindness restorers our faith in todays society. He is a credit and shines as an exampled to all of us that there are kind people out there. Vince we salute you and wish you many years of happiness as you deserve the best in life.'
Gaynor Longmire said: 'Vince is a great fella, and it always a pleasure to see him when he delivers to our shop...a true gentleman with a heart of gold.'

The videos see Corden participate in a car share with a celebrity and has already featured stars to the likes of Mariah Carey, Justin Bieber and Iggy Azaelea.
Speaking at the palace on Thursday, James revealed that his ultimate royal appearance would come from Prince Harry, but then again any royal appearance would be a dream come true.
'I can absolutely say that any member of the royal family,' he joked. 'Should they wish to, the invitation will always be there to do a Carpool Karaoke.'
'I don't imagine they'll take me up on it, but should they ever wish they are all welcome, yes.'
Happy families: James, joined here by his mother and father, recently said that his mum was busily trying to decide what to wear to the ceremony
Stateside success: James has recently taken his comedy styling over to the US and cracked The Late Late Show over there
Recognition: James explained that while the honour was 'wonderful' he felt unworthy
Sights are high: Corden joked that he'd love to have Prince Harry take part in his Carpool Karaoke feature on the US chat show
Pinching himself: Julia and James enjoyed a candid moment in front of the cameras
At the time that James' accolade was announced he joked that his mother was already fretting about her outfit, saying: 'My family are very proud. My mum is already fretting about what to wear.'
But it looked like faithful partner Julia didn't have any trouble picking out the right thing and looked elegant in black and white.
She wore black patent heels to set off an a-line dress with lily floral detail, a clutch bag in her hand just rested by her side.
Also being honoured on the day was television presenter Esther, bold in deep red, who was being made a Dame.
What an honour: Corden was delivered the honour by the Princess Royal, who he shook hands with
Special invitation: James entered into formal conversation with the royal inside Buckingham Palace
Making her giggle: He evidently couldn't resist making her giggle when he stepped up
Getting on famously: The pair appeared to be enjoying an excellent conversation
Nerve-racking: Corden seemed to clam up when caught in conversation with the royal
Proud: On the same day,Esther Rantzen was made a Dame by the Princess Royal at an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace
Lady in red: Esther was bold in a deep red wrap dress, bolero and hat for the ceremony
Matching manicure: She held up the honour with a matching manicure on her fingertips

	This group of migrants, many of them elderly, were photographed on Grosvenor Place - one of the exclusive roads that borders the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

        <MainBody>Groom's heartwarming reaction as bride walks down aisle
Curled up: Two women huddle together for warmth as they sleep in the doorway on Grosvenor Place in central London
Packing up: In a matter of minutes the migrants can fold away their entire lives, ready for another day on the streets of the capital
A new day: Two rough sleepers stand in a doorway. It is estimated that some 40 per cent of London's homeless population are migrants
Homeless: One man curls up in front of one of the luxury addresses on Grosvenor Place in central London
Belongings: A group of people sleep beneath colourful blankets in one of the doorways - scraps of food on the ledge next to them
A spokesperson for Westminster City Council said: 'As this is private land, the council has no power to move people on but we will work with the leaseholders to support and advise them on a suitable resolution.
'We take the issue very seriously and commission outreach teams in the area to ensure the welfare and safety of those in genuine need of help.
'We work hard with the Police and Immigration Services to address any area where groups are involved in anti-social behaviour.'
The most recent photographs of the migrants have emerged as European leaders gather in Belgium to discuss the growing crisis facing the continent.
The 28 member states have faced a recent influx of illegal immigrants so desperate to live in Europe that they are risking their lives on dangerous road journeys and crossings of the Mediterranean.
And it comes just weeks after another group of migrants was pictured sleeping rough at Marble Arch. More than 70 migrants are now said to be sleeping rough in the area - with some of them, believed to be Eastern Europeans.
Owners of nearby businesses have said not enough is being done to tackle the problem of migrants sleeping rough, some of whom have been living in the area for two years.
Westminster City Council has in the past campaigned to remove migrants from the area - at one point even buying them tickets home - but said earlier this month it needs tougher powers to enforce their removal.
TACKLING HOMELESSNESS ON THE STREET OF LONDON
All local authorities in the UK have been given a target to reduce people sleeping rough in the community.
Councils work alongside teams from outreach groups, the Metropolitan Police and, in the case of migrant rough sleepers, Home Office Immigration Enforcement, to assess the needs of rough sleepers and help provide them with accommodation.
Outreach teams and other services work to help rough sleepers into a range of accommodation types, most commonly hostels but also the private rented sector and residential treatment centres.
Services also help people to reconnect to their home area or country, where they are more likely to find a solution to their homelessness, for example through appropriate support networks, entitlement to accommodation or access to an alcohol treatment centre.
Last year, the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals would face deportation under an EU law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient.
Westminster Council has previously held high-level talks with Home Office officials about the issue, after the number of Romanian rough sleepers in Central London jumping from 20 in January to 59 in May 2014.
Cramped: A man reaches out and stretches before packing up his belongings into the carrier bags strewn on the doorstep around him

	WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT. Emma Clark left three dogs, two cats, two rabbits, two snakes and a lizard locked in cages at her home in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, for months.

The court heard that inspectors found the decaying animals in different parts of the house, with used tea bags stacked up against one of the decomposing dogs
Mr McCole said: 'He could smell something rotting when he got to the back door. He pushed the door open to be greeted by an horrific sight.
Horrific: Emma Clarke left ten animals to starve to death, telling the RSPCA that she had re-homed them
Sickening: Clark, 28, left three dogs, two cats, two rabbits, two snakes and a lizard locked in cages with no food or water
'There was no evidence of any water available for any of the severely emaciated animals.
'The defendant's parents were shocked and horrified when the RSPCA spoke to them.
'They had been led to believe the animals had been re-homed at an earlier stage but the evidence showed that wasn't the case.
These animals will have suffered, starving to death in cages, it would have been horrible
RSPCA inspector Sheona Morley
'The animals had died while in the defendant's care and control.
'She had just given up. She returned to the house from time to time but hadn't provided food, sustenance or water for the animals.'
In a police interview, Clark confirmed she was responsible for all the animals but said she'd been having serious family problems and that 'everything just went wrong'.
Addressing the magistrates herself, Clark said: 'I didn't want any of these things to happen.'
Clark, of no fixed abode, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the ten animals over a period of nearly four months. She was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from owning animals for life.
She was also ordered to pay 300 costs and an 80 victim surcharge.
Tragic: Shockingly, some of the pets were thought to have been dead for up to five months by the time they were finally found
Distressing footage played to the court showed RSPCA officers finding the decaying and mummified animals in Clark's former home
Clark was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from keeping animals before leaving the pets to starve to death
Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA inspector Sheona Morley said: 'In my 20 years, this is the most horrific case I've ever been to - it is also the saddest.
'This was a case of horrific cruelty which could have been easily avoided if she had asked for help from her friends and family or tried to re-home her animals.
'It was absolute horror to see all those animals had died from starvation, left in their cages with no access to food or water.
'This is an incredibly sad case, everyone involved is absolutely devastated - these animals will have suffered, starving to death in cages, it would have been horrible.
'Whatever sentence she got nothing is going to undo the suffering caused to those poor animals.
'Nothing can undo what happened to these poor animals. There's no excuse for that kind of cruelty.'

Mike Stubbs, director of London Overground, said: 'This is a horrible attack on a revenue officer doing their job.
'We take every assault on staff and passengers extremely seriously and will be working closely with the police to assist them with their investigation and push for the toughest penalties.'
A spokeswoman for the London Ambulance Service said the two victims were taken as 'priorities to hospital'.
She said: 'We were called at 7:56pm to reports of an assault at South Tottenham railway station. We sent two ambulance crews and our hazardous area response team to the scene. We treated two patients. They were taken as priorities to hospital.'

	Immigration and an ageing population have fuelled a boom in the number of people living in the UK, official figures released by the Office for National Statistics revealed this morning.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
The population increase over   was fuelled by growing numbers of births over deaths, caused by people living longer, and a surge in migration.
'Natural growth'  of 226,200 accounted for around half the population increase - with net migration of 259,700 making up the rest.
Between mid-2013 and mid-2014, 582,600 migrants arrived in the UK, compared with just 322,900 people leaving the country.
An ONS spokesman said the statistics meant the UK population had grown by almost half a million since mid-2013, up 0.77 per cent to 64,596,800.
Out of the wider UK population, England accounted for 54.3 million, up 0.84 per cent, with the Scottish population hitting 5.3 million - up 0.37 per cent.
Wales's population has grown 0.31 per cent to 3.1 million, with a further 1.8 million living in Northern Ireland.
Use this map to see how your local population has changed
Tower Hamlets had the largest population increase in the country - increasing 34.5 per cent over just 10 years.
This was because 56,300 people came to the area from overseas and 12,000 left the area to live elsewhere in the UK, giving a net migration gain of 44,400.A further 32,700 more people were born in the area than died, the figures showed.
Eight of the 10 local authorities with the biggest population growth between 2004 and 2014 were in London.The remaining two were Corby in the East Midlands and Slough in the South East.
There were 16 local authorities, meanwhile, which saw their population fall over the last decade. The greatest loss was seen in Kensington &amp; Chelsea in West London - which lost 5.8 per cent of its population.
The main driver of this decrease was net internal migration, a high number of people moving to live elsewhere in the UK.
However, the majority of local authorities suffering falling populations were in the North of England.
The populations of Barrow-in-Furness and Cleveland slumped as families moved to other areas of the country for work.

	Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said work remained the best root out of poverty, and called on companies to increase pay for their staff ahead of planned cuts to tax credits.

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Duncan Smith told MPs: 'I believe today's figures demonstrate that if you deal with the root causes of poverty - and I believe this Government is doing that - then even under a measure of poverty I have consistently over the last few years described as flawed, you can still have an impact.'
The Tory government is planning to scrap Labours controversial child poverty target within weeks.
The legally binding target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 is to be repealed.
In a speech this week, David Cameron said: 'Because of the way it is measured, we are in the absurd situation where if we increase the state pension, child poverty actually goes up.
Poverty levels remained level in the last year, but the proportion of people in absolute low income after hosuing costs has risen steadily in recent years
Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: 'Politicians might understand these measurements but the electorate certainly doesn't. What I hope would interest the electorate is action to prevent poor children becoming poor adults.
'We must therefore begin talking about, and measuring, poor children's life chances and how they can be improved. It is important that such measurements are accurate, but that they can also safely drive anti-poverty policy.'
However, charities warned that levels of poverty were still too high and warned further benefits cuts would make the problem worse.
Javed Khan, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, said:'Every child living in poverty is a child that's being let down. Child poverty is a direct reflection of a failure, as a society, to protect our most vulnerable families.
'Poverty is blighting the life chances of our children, making them more likely to fall sick, do less well at school and be unemployed in the future. Government plans to cut struggling families' incomes further by changing tax credits is deeply concerning.'
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said work remained the best root out of poverty, and called on companies to increase pay for their staff ahead of planned cuts to tax credits
Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: 'Moving the goalposts by changing the definition of child poverty will do nothing to help the millions of children who are suffering in real poverty.
'The Government needs to stop debating definitions and start doing more to help children.'
The 28billion budget for tax credits paid to working people is expected to suffer the biggest cuts in George Osborne's Budget on July 8.
Tax credits are paid to people whose income from work is judged not enough to live on.
Ministers have demanded that firms pay their staff properly instead of relying on the benefit system to top up their workers' wages through tax credits.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'The extreme cuts to tax credits the Government is planning for working families will do nothing to raise wages and will leave low-paid families even worse off. There's a big danger this will start poverty rates rising again.'

Another shot shows a massive crowd of children gathered at the flogging site, with young fathers holding theirs sons and elderly men struggling to view the atrocity from behind teenage boys.
Bizarrely, at least two of the boys wear football shirts belonging to Western clubs - Italy's AC Milan and France's Paris Saint-Germain - a chilling reminder of how their innocence is being corrupted by witnessing rape, massacre and unduly harsh public punishments on a near-daily basis.
Throughout the month of Ramadan, which began last Thursday, the majority of Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and having sex from dawn until sunset.
For most Muslims around the world, fasting is down to personal willpower, but under the brutal rule of ISIS, which regularly stages public beheading, stonings and crucifixions those accused if crimes, the punishments for not obeying religious law is unsurprisingly harsh.

ISIS MILITANTS RE-ENTER KOBANE: JIHADIS DETONATE SUICIDE BOMB AND LEAVE BODIES STREWN ACROSS SYRIAN TOWN'S STREETS
ISIS fighters have re-entered the key Syrian town of Kobane, detonating a suicide bomb and battling Kurdish forces in the streets.
At least 12 people have been killed and 70 wounded as the terror group attacked the town on three sides after reportedly coming across the border from Turkey.
ISIS battled for four months to seize the border town last year, but Kurdish fighters backed by US-led air strikes wrestled back control in January in a symbolic victory.
In the months since, forces of the Kurdish People's Protection Units have advanced from Kobane in Aleppo province into neighbouring Raqqa province, a stronghold of ISIS.
In recent days, they captured the strategic town of Tal Abyad, also on the border with Turkey, and pushed towards ISIS's de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city in the Euphrates valley to the south.
The news comes just days after ISIS savages tied two young boys to a beam by their wrists and left them hanging in the air for several hours after accusing them of breaking the Ramadan fast.
The shocking incident took place in the village of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province and involved boys 'aged under 18', according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights.
The Hisbah, seized the two boys at some point over the weekend and suspended them from a pole in a public square alongside a placard informing passers by that the pair were being punished for eating during daylight hours.
Residents of the village of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province reported that IS suspended from a crossbar two boys aged under 18 near the HQ of the Hisbah', Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based human rights monitor revealed.
'The children have been suspended by ropes from a pole since noon, and they were still there in the late evening... Apparently, they were caught eating,' he added.
A placard was attached to the bodies reading 'They broke the fast with no religious justification'.

Violence: Police officers detain a migrant accused of throwing stones at a truck during a clash between migrants and a truck driver next of the ferry boat port of Calais on Wednesday
Migrants climb on board vehicles heading for England
Ten migrants were found in the back of an articulated lorry parked in a truck park in Folkestone, Kent at 4.30pm yesterday.
A Kent Police spokesman said: 'They were all fine and taken by police to Dover Immigration Centre and are now under their care.'
The worsening migrant plight near the Port of Calais has seen numbers camped there swell to more than 3,000 since April.
Aid workers have reported a 'catastrophic' situation, with predictions that some 2,000 more migrants displaced from war-torn countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan could arrive over the summer.
Statistics showing the number of people who applied for asylum in the UK in the month of April are due to be released today.

	Paul Barker, 39, and wife Kerry, 30, from Hetton, Sunderland, were due to appear in court on Tuesday over the theft of nine bottles of wine worth £89.91 but failed to arrive for their 10am hearing.

They initially appeared at Sunderland Magistrates Court in May after being taking the food on the supermarket's CCTV.
Both admitted theft but were given absolute discharges.
Their absence comes after they scavenged from bins outside their local Tesco Express (pictured) in Hetton, Sunderland, after their benefits were stopped
They said they were forced to live off discarded food, which they allege supermarkets would otherwise throw away, because they could not afford to feed themselves
Mrs Barker, who gave up her job at Durham County Council five years ago due to depression,was charged with theft and her husband, who left his job as a scaffolder after breaking his back, was accused of handling stolen goods on June 7.
Commenting on their 'no show', Mr Barker's solicitor Brian Chapman said: 'I would invite you to issue a warrant to see whether these people have indeed been stuck inside the bins in Tesco.'
A warrant was issued for their arrest. The couple will now be brought before the court when they are detained.

	British universities allow foreign students to use dictionaries in exams

	EXCLUSIVE: Among the dozens of institutions which give finalists access to a dictionary are some of the country's most prestigious universities, including 12 members of the elite Russell Group.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
In total, half of the Russell Group, which is often thought of as the top tier of British universities, sanction the use of dictionaries in exams.
However, Oxford and Cambridge, along with most leading London universities such as University College, King's College, Imperial and LSE, do not allow the practice.
University bosses claim that letting foreign students use dictionaries evens the playing field for all - pointing out that they have to attain a minimum level of English to get a student visa.
Prestigious: The University of St Andrews, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met, is one of the elite universities which allows the use of dictionaries
However, some experts have suggested that it is unfair to let one group of students use dictionaries when others are not allowed to do so.
In addition, critics link the regulations to universities' push to recruit more students from outside the EU, who pay fees many times higher than those demanded from British students.
Anger: MP Philip Davies said the university rules were 'absolutely ridiculous' and warned that institutions could compromise their standards
Tory MP Philip Davies told MailOnline: 'I think this is absolutely ridiculous. An exam should be the same for everyone and universities shouldn't be bending the rules to help foreign students and giving them qualifications when their standard of English is not up to scratch.
'It is sad that in their desperate rush to get as much money from overseas students as possible that our universities are prepared to compromise on their standards and rigour.'
Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, added: 'Once you give a dictionary to the non-English speaker, you're discriminating against English speakers. It's confusing, it's misleading, it's unfair.
'They should not be sacrificing academic integrity to recruit more foreign students.'
Universities UK, the body which represents all higher education institutions, warned that relaxing standards for overseas students could be damaging to academic excellence.
Chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: 'International students are subject to numerous tests to ensure they meet high English language requirements.
'For overseas students to benefit from studying at a UK university, they need a high level of English so that they can complete written assessments and take part in discussions and seminars.
'It is in no one's interest for international students to come to the UK if they are unable to complete their studies because they are struggling with the language.'
A spokesman for the UK Council for International Student Affairs said: 'We would welcome any support for international students.'
MailOnline surveyed a total of 127 universities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Of those, 62 said that they do allow foreign students to use dictionaries in exams, 53 said they do not, and 12 failed to respond.
Help: At dozens of universities, students from outside the EU are given permission to take in dictionaries translating between their native language and English
Around a dozen of the 62 universities let all students use dictionaries, regardless of whether or not their first language is English.
Most of the institutions specify that students can only use a translation dictionary, between their own language and English, but some allow them to use regular dictionaries which contain words' definitions in English only.
Nearly all universities say that they check students' dictionaries to ensure that they do not contain any notes or additional material which could fuel suspicion of cheating.
Some only let students use dictionaries which are provided by exam invigilators, in a further attempt to stop students taking advantage of the policy to smuggle in crib sheets.
Universities have been keen to recruit as many students as possible from outside the EU because there is no cap on the level of fees they can charge.
Foreign students typically pay up to 14,000 a year for most courses, compared to a limit of 9,000 for students from the UK and other EU countries.
The Government requires overseas students to sit an English language test in order to qualify for a visa.
In addition, the most prestigious institutions have their own tougher language exam, which they say ensures that all students are completely fluent in English by the time they start their degree.
There is no official Government policy on the use of dictionaries in exams, because as autonomous institutions universities are free to set their own regulations in most areas.
The Quality Assessment Authority, which certifies degrees, says: 'Through inclusive design wherever possible, and through individual reasonable adjustments wherever required, assessment tasks [must] provide every student with an equal opportunity to demonstrate their achievement.'

Extra police patrols were being deployed in the area this weekend, but officers said the incident was being treated as 'isolated'.
Chief Inspector Patrick Holdaway said: 'My thoughts go out to the children who have been hurt and their families. We're providing assistance to them at the current time and both children are being treated in hospital for their injuries.
Two boys were stabbed as they walked home from school along this road (pictured) this afternoon
Police cordon off the scene where two boys were stabbed
'We'd like to reassure the local community that no-one else is being sought in connection with this assault at this time.
'Thankfully no-one else was hurt in the incident and there is no further risk to members of the public.
'Our inquiries indicate that a school in the local area had an inset day, so there were not large groups of parents and children in the area when the assault happened shortly before 3pm.
'A cordon will remain in place overnight to preserve evidence. Local officers will also be patrolling across the weekend and will be speaking to local residents to keep them informed.'
Police were last night speaking to witnesses and appealed to anyone who may have seen anything out of the ordinary in the area shortly before 3pm to come forward.
A police spokesman said: 'Police deployed immediately to the scene and a 43-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested.
'He has been taken into custody and detectives have commenced an investigation.'
Anyone with information is asked to call Hampshire Constabulary on 101, quoting Operation Narrow.
Witnesses said a knife was found in the road and that pupils and parents had recently been warned about a man hanging around the neighbourhood, exposing himself to pupils.
A woman working at a local children's nursery said the boys were walking home from nearby Warblington School at the time of the attack.
She said: 'When we heard about the attack we went into lockdown to make sure our children here were protected.
A policeman talks to a member of the public on the junction between Southleigh Road and Horndean Road
'One of our workers was at home and rang in with details as one of her friends' friends is the mother of one of the boys.
'He is 12 and it seems he was walking home with a friend when they were victims of what we understand to be a knife attack.
'It's a busy road at that time with school traffic so I would imagine there were people on the scene very quickly.
'We know police and ambulances rushed there and we had the police helicopter going overhead.'
The front page of the Warblington School website currently features a warning to parents and pupils to be 'extra vigilant' in the area at the moment.
The undated post reads: 'We would ask parents to ensure that their children are extra vigilant during their journey to and from school as there has been an incident of exposure to a student from this school within the last 24 hours. The police are involved.'
Witnesses said a knife was found in the road and that pupils and parents had recently been warned about a man hanging around the neighbourhood, exposing himself to pupils
Locals posted comments about the stabbing on Facebook this evening.
Sean Murtagh said: 'My other half passed just as the police were blocking the road. She saw a knife in the road, whether that's related to this incident or not I don't know.'
A parent of a child at the school, Pauline Matthews, said: 'There was trouble a few weeks ago there. I got a text from the school saying there was a bloke hanging around exposing himself to kids.'
A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary today said the National Police Air Service have been called out to help police on the ground.
Extra officers will be patrolling the area this evening to provide reassurance to those living in the area.
No one else is being sought by police in connection with the incident and a cordon is in place at the scene on Horndean Road.
Police were called to the scene shortly after 3pm after a 999 call came in to say the two youngsters had been attacked in the street by a man. One of the boys was taken to Southampton General Hospital (pictured)
A witness on the ground who arrived near the scene half an hour later said: 'There was a very loud helicopter circling above and all the mums and children from the nearby school were wondering what was going on.
'There were lots of police cars and an ambulance.
'I just can't believe what's happened. It's horrific. And in a small town like Emsworth which is usually so quiet. It's awful.
'I saw a few young girls on the side of the road very upset.'
Delivery driver Derek Wherry, 39, who lives on the road where police arrested the man, described the news as 'worrying'.
He said: 'We don't expect this to happen around here.
'There's so many police around here you wouldn't believe it. There's been police cars all afternoon screaming around the place and helicopters circling above.
'It's worrying to know that one of the kids had been taken to Southampton General but also reassuring to hear someone is in custody.'
Hampshire Constabulary (headquarters pictured) said a man had been arrested in relation to the attack and are appealing for witnesses

Martinstetter warned 'You can buy these things on the internet and easily put explosives on them but there is no efficient protection against them.
The system, which the German Ministry of Defense is part funding, envisages an external sensor like a radar spotting the target before a low power laser beam illuminates it for better targeting.
An optical sensor then locks onto the target and guides the laser.
The new weapon is reminiscent of the one used by the Death Star in the propular star Wars films
The drone, circled, landed in front of Ms Merkel as she delivered a speech in Germany sparking fears that the device could easily be used to commit a terrorist act.
The four, 10 kilowatt lasers are focused into one beam by a mirror. The sytems' efficiency is about 30 percent, meaning that 400 to 500 kilowatts of battery power are required to produce the 100 kilowatt laser.
'We have designed a system with six lasers and 8 to 10 is possible, but 4-6 is the best number for reasons of size,' Martinstetter told Defence news.
The four laser, 100 kilowatt set-up would be mounted on the same type truck used to ferry the MEADS missile defense system, he said.
The firm plans to have the ability to knock out IEDs using a 5 to 20 kilowatt laser mounted on a vehicle at a range of less than 500 meters , as well as the ability to blind or destroy optics using a 5 kilowatt laser at a range of 2.5 kilometers.
Five years after the signing of a full development contract, the firm would be able to offer a counter piracy laser with a range of less than 1,000 meters using a 10-40 kilowatt laser.

A mid to long range plan is for an antimissile laser firing a 100 kilowatt beam up to 3 milometers .
'We are now working on a deployable, ruggedized laser demonstrator, but the principal technology is proven,' said Martinstetter.
Earlier this year it conducted the first tests of its systems.
Man tackled to ground for trying to fly 'drone' over White House
It deployed a laser effector to acquire, track, and defeat a free-flying mini drone, the first time such technology has been used to this effect.
The mini drone was destroyed within seconds of the start of the test which was carried out at MBDA Deutschland's testing area in Schrobenhausen.
The drone in question manoeuvred in the target area at a range of about 500m with the test proving the laser effector's capability to combat realistic targets with precision, speed and safety.

'We are going to suggest, with reasons connected with her background, there were powerful reasons for Paige Chivers to finally leave home.
'Can I be sure she is alive? No I cannot but equally you cannot be sure she is dead either. The evidence is simply not good enough to make any rational, careful person be sure.'
Detectives hunting for Paige Chivers, who vanished in suspicious circumstances eight years ago, dug up a farmer's field amid fears she maybe buried in a shallow grave but still no trace of her has been found
Police investigate a site in Thornton Cleveleys in Lancashire during an earlier search for Paige's body
An extensive proof of life inquiry had not found any evidence Paige was alive and she had yet to claim a 'significant' inheritance sum left to her on her mother's death once she turned 18, the jury heard.
The Crown has told the jury they can be sure Paige is dead even though no body has been found.
Ewing was arrested in connection with her disappearance in September last year and is currently on trial at Preston Crown Court.
But Mr Denney said there are people who 'badly' do not want to be in contact with the authorities for various reasons.
He also pointed out that four separate, independent witnesses - including her brother - said they had seen Paige locally in the weeks after her supposed murder
He said: 'How are you to exclude that Paige Chivers is not findable in the United Kingdom because she is elsewhere?
'All I say to you is the fact is if Paige Chivers or any 15-year-old wanted to disappear and stay disappeared she certainly could if she wished.'
In his closing speech to the jury on behalf of Ewing,s barrister Stuart Denney QC suggested the 'off the rails' and 'wild' teenager (pictured) had decided to run away and is still alive
Police search field for the body of missing Paige Chivers
Addressing the inheritance, he said: 'She knew there was something coming for her, yet she did not know how much it was.
'If she made a fresh start for herself in 2007 do you think it makes any sort of common sense to come back three years later. Her family have been distraught, the police have expended so much and she strolls back.'
Ewing, formerly of Bispham, Blackpool, denies the murder of Paige between August 23 and August 27 2007.
He also denies intending to pervert the course of public justice by intimidating witnesses and providing false information to the police in their investigations.
A co-defendant, Gareth Dewhurst, 46, of Duncan Avenue, Blackpool, also denies intending to pervert the course of public justice.
Dewhurst has also pleaded not guilty to sexual penetration of a corpse and not guilty to assisting an offender in disposing of a body.
He is said to have told a 16-year-old boy that Ewing had killed Paige and then made him have sex with her corpse before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body.
The court previously heardEwing had an 'inappropriate sexual interest' in 15-year-old Paige and took advantage of her 'chaotic and dysfunctional' upbringing which had left her 'very troubled and vulnerable'.
Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home and, despite appeals from police and a 12,000 reward offer from TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found.
The trial continues.

'A small bag was found onboard which nobody claimed and the crew therefore decided to contact Copenhagen airport to ask for permission for an emergency landing,' Kristian Aaskov, duty police officer, told Reuters by telephone.
Dr. Ali Genc, a spokesman for Turkish Airlines, said there the Boeing 777 plane had been diverted to Copenhagen 'as a precautionary measure following a possible security alert.'
He said all passengers and cabin crew were safely evacuated to the terminal building. The plane eventually reached New York around four hours behind schedule.
MailOnline Travel has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment and is awaiting a response.
Passengers were forced to return to the airport as the plane was checked by security officials
Back in March a Turkish Airlines flight was forced into an emergency landing after a note with the word 'bomb' was reportedly found in the toilet.
The flight from Istanbul scheduled for Sao Paulo, Brazil touched down in Casablanca, Morocco after declaring an emergency over North Africa.
The airline confirmed the Boeing 777 with the flight number TK15 was carrying 256 people and made a diversion due to a 'bomb threat'.
Only two days earlier, a Turkish Airlines flight out of Istanbul was subject of a bomb threat.
Flight TK-52 from Istanbul to Tokyo was forced to land at Ataturk Airport after the words 'C4-Cargo' were discovered written in the toilet.
The words relate to the plastic explosive C-4.
BGN News reported that the words were discovered by the cabin crew. They alerted the pilot who sent out a signal to make an emergency landing.
After the passengers were evacuated after landing, a full sweep took place involving mobile technology, but no threat was discovered.

        <MainBody>Corey Davison, 11, was left paralysed down one side of his face after life-saving surgery for a brain tumour
It was an operation that saved his life after he was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour.
But while it was successful, the surgery leftCory Davison with a further devastating problem - paralysis down the side of his face.
The 11-year-old defied the odds to survive a rare and aggressive form ofcancer, diagnosed when he was just six years old.
After a tumour the size of a plum was discovered around Cory's brain stem, he was forced to undergo a delicate seven-hour operation.
During it, surgeons attempted to remove as much of the growth as possible, withoutdamaging his brain.
But while performing the procedure, which ultimately saved his life, medics were forced to cut through delicate nerves, leaving one side of his face paralysed.
For the past four years, Cory, who has a twin called Cain, has lived with the damage surgery caused to his sight, hearing, balance, and  movement in his face.
Now tumour-free and preparing to start high school, Cory, from Blyth, Northumberland, has taken the decision himself to go under the knife again.
On Monday, a team of surgeons will take muscles from his legs and insertthem in his face in the hope that he will regain movement.
His father Steven said the family hoped the surgery,which will last around eight hours, will help Cory have a normal childhood.
The 35-year-old said: 'It was Cory's choice to do this. He's going to highschool in September and obviously he's at an age now where he is consciousabout his looks.

	Alexander Wood, 33, was due at Highbury Magistrates Court, where he is accused of claiming to be the Duke of Marlborough at the luxury Great Northern Hotel in King's Cross.

Officers arrested the man on suspicion of fraud. He was later charged with making off without payment of a sum of 645.60.
The hotel - where a night's stay can cost up to 325 - has refused to comment on the incident.
The alleged con resembles the plot in an episode of Fawlty Towers - the iconic 1970s comedy starring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.
The pilot episode, called 'A Touch of Class', follows Basil as he tries to raise the tone of the hotel as the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.
Basil starts fawning over his Lordship, ignoring the rest of his guests and even cashing dodgy cheques for him, until workers discover the man is actually a fraudster.
The alleged con resembles the plot in the pilot episode of Fawlty Towers - the iconic 1970s comedy starring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty - where a fraudster claimed to bearistocratic Lord Melbury (pictured above)
The Great Northern Hotel was designed by Victorian master builder Lewis Cubitt and first opened its doors in 1854.
It describes itself on its website as 'magnificently refurbished' and the 'finest luxury boutique hotel in London'.

A new hearing date for Wood is yet to be set.
FRAUDSTER CONS BASIL FAWLTY BY POSING AS LORD IN ICONIC SITCOM
The alleged fraud is similar to an episode of theiconic 1970s comedy Fawlty Towers, which starred John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.
The pilot episode, called 'A Touch of Class', follows Basil as he tries to raise the tone of the hotel as the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.
Basil starts fawning over his well-dressed Lordship, ignoring the rest of his guests and even cashing dodgy cheques for him, after becoming infatuated by his air of class.

Polly (right) discovers thatLord Melbury is in fact a fraud and a confidence trickster and breaks the news to Basil and his wife Sybil (centre). The man claiming to be Melbury is  ordered out of the hotel and arrested
However, all is not as it seems and hotel worker Polly Sherman - played by Cleese's real-life ex-wife Connie Booth - discovers thatLord Melbury is in fact a fake.
She makes the discovery after going into Torquay - the town where the comedy is set - and bumping into local policemen who inform her they have been watching Melbury.
He is revealed to be a confidence trickster pulling off a large scam in the town.
Polly later returns to the hotel and informs Basil he has been duped. The fraudster posing as Melbury is frogmarched out of the hotel and later arrested by police.
Fawlty Towers was a BBC sitcom which ran in the 1970s. Only two series - a total of 12 episodes - of the hit-show were ever made, being aired for the first time in 1975 and 1979 respectively.
The series was set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, in the 'English Riviera' of south Devon.
It has previously been named several times as one of the best British television series of all time.

Mr Dunford said Aaron was just 'a typical lad at university enjoying himself but fell foul to this legal high.'
He said: 'It should be made illegal because it's harming kids.
'It's down to the government who need to make it illegal, it's really doing damage to kids.
'To be honest I didn't have a clue about the drug before but it seems to be a cheap party drug in university towns. Taking it even once may be too much.
'It's a proven fact that kids have died so I don't get why the kids are doing it.'

Mr Dunford added: 'I was not aware that he was taking the drug and I had seen him about four months before he died.
'His younger brothers are devastated. He was a typical lad at university enjoying himself but fell foul to this legal high.
'I've done a bit of research into it and it's so easy to get hold of on the internet.'
Aaron's chronic nerve pain was due to a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by inhaling the dangerous nitrous oxide gas, the inquest heard.

According to findings in the Global Drugs Survey,some 15 million people in the UK have inhaled nitrous oxide for feelings of light-headedness and euphoria.
Detective Inspector Mick Jones of Sussex Police, who oversaw the investigation into Aaron's death, said people should think again before taking the drug.
Following the inquest, DI Jones said: 'Anyone considering using this substance in this way should think again.
'The effect of asphyxia through inhalation could happen on the first occasion it is used or after repeated use.
'This tragic case has highlighted that even when it does not result in a fatality that there are longer term effects on your health.
'Despite the deceased being a young man, he was unable to walk down a simple flight of steps due to the chronic pain he had in his knees, which was a direct result of using nitrous oxide gas.'
The University of Brighton student's death was recorded as a verdict of misadventure by asphyxiation, inhalation of nitrous oxide and chronic nerve pain likely due to B12 deficiency caused by chronic use of the gas, Brighton Coroner's Court, East Sussex heard.

Nitrous oxide continues to have several legitimate uses, such as numbing pain for dental work, increasing power in engines and food production.
Although not illegal to possess, it can be very dangerous to inhale - not least because it pushes oxygen out of the lungs.
It was responsible for 17 deaths in the UK between 2006 and 2012, according to research from the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton.
And according to the Global Drugs Survey, which quizzed 102,000 people extensively on their use of substances, only Holland inhales more hippy crack than Britain.
Just yesterday at the Glastonbury festival, hundreds of revellers were pictured taking the substance with balloons.
Aaron, originally from East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, died on March 2.

An article on May 27 said that burglar Wayne Bishop had been released early from prison so that he could look after his five children on the grounds that their rights were more important than the rights of his victims. We are happy to make clear that the judgment in fact weighed the childrens rights against the seriousness of Bishops offences and not against the victims rights.
A graphic accompanying a news item published in one edition yesterday wrongly stated that the cost of Prince Harrys 2014 visit to Brazil and Chile was 185,626. In fact, as the article itself stated, the trip cost 85,626.
