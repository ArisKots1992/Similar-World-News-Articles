	Office for National Statistics figures show married couple numbers have increased

	In 2011, married men and women were almost a minority at just 50.7 per cent of the adult population. But last year 51.2 per cent of people over the age of 16 were found to have tied the knot.

Explanations for the changing trend include suggestions that partnerships are increasingly stable because couples are choosing to marry later.
Official recognition of so-called pre-nup deals is also thought to have had an effect, as it means couples are more willing to risk a wedding.
On the rise: Last year 51.2 per cent of people over the age of 16 were found to have tied the knot (file image)
Other factors could include the impact of immigration, which is bringing into the country people with a greater attachment to marriage than many of the existing population.
The ONS figures found 51.2 per cent of people over 16 in England and Wales were married in 2014. The figure went up to 51.5 per cent when civil partnerships were included.
It compared with 54.8 per cent of adults who were married in 2002.
The report showed that cohabitation continues to grow in popularity but mainly among young people.
Those under the age of 30 are increasingly likely to choose to cohabit rather than to marry, and fewer than a quarter of all those aged between 25 and 30 were married men or women last year.
Around one in eight of the adult population are now cohabiting with a partner. Three quarters of the cohabitees have never been married.
Cohabiting relationships are highly unstable compared to marriages and those that do not lead to a wedding are at least three times more likely to break up than a marriage.
Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation think tank said: One of the paradoxes of our modern approach to marriage is that marrying later on tends to be more successful.
'But starting later means that if your marriage does go wrong, youre less likely to marry a second time because youre so much older.
Of course that doesnt stop older people marrying. It just becomes less common. In both cases, inertia plays a big part in making older marriages work and much older people less likely to remarry.
'When youre older youre more likely to stick with what you know.
'SILVER SPLITTERS' FUEL SURGE IN DIVORCEES
The number of divorcees in Britain is rising relentlessly, driven by silver splitters.
An analysis of living habits showed that 8.2 per cent of the adult population of England and Wales  almost one person in 12  was a divorcee last year, compared with 7.4 per cent in 2002.
The Office for National Statistics said of its findings: This [rise] is being driven by the population aged over 45, who have seen larger increases in the percentage divorced than younger age groups. Nearly one in ten people over the age of 65 are now divorced, twice the level at the beginning of the century.
The growing willingness of this age group to contemplate separation is said to be linked to longer life expectancy, which makes it more likely that older people will prove unfaithful.
Womens increasing financial independence is also said to have an impact. Experts in family law say the figures reflect a decline in the stigma surrounding separation.

	Barclays fire CEO Antony Jenkins as bank says 'new set of skills' is needed
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3153139/Barclays-chief-executive-Antony-Jenkins-sacked.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490
      </Link>
        <Description>
	Jenkins took over in 2012 and told a Treasury Committee in February 2013 he would ‘feel obliged to resign’ if there was a ‘grave regulatory event that happened under my watch’.
      </Description>

He said the announcement was delayed out of respect for Mr Jenkins, who was making a speech in the City on Tuesday evening.
We could not hold it any longer than 7am Wednesday morning because I had told executive directors and they might tell their wives, their lovers, whoever, said Mr McFarlane.
It is amazing it didnt leak out, even though I read the riot act to people about keeping quiet. I can assure you we did not deliberately do it on Budget Day.
Appearing before the banking standards commission in 2013, Jenkins vowed to transform Barclays
Despite his denials, it is the second time in two years that the bank has issued bad news on Budget day.
In 2013 it made an announcement that it was showering former investment banking chief Rich Ricci with 17.5million of shares and that Mr Jenkins was receiving 5.3million-worth.
Barclays shares rose strongly after Mr Jenkins exit was announced. He had taken over from Bob Diamond, who quit in the wake of the Libor rate-rigging scandal, in 2012 vowing to clean up the banks culture and repair its relationship with customers and City regulators.
It earned him the nickname Saint Antony but his efforts to overhaul the high street lender, which included cutting tens of thousands of jobs, did not progress fast enough.
Barclays was fined 1.5billion in May for manipulating the foreign exchange market (file photo)
He was toppled following a board meeting late last month, where non-executives led by veteran industrialist Sir Mike Rake said they wanted him to step aside.
Mr McFarlane said: Some very strident voices came forward saying we are very grateful to Antony, but we dont think he is the right person for the future, we think somebody different is required.
The chairman will take the reins on his current pay packet of 800,000 until a replacement for Mr Jenkins is found.
Although Barclays has yet to recover fully from the battering it took in the financial crisis, Mr Jenkins will get an exit package consisting of a years pay of 1.1million, plus 950,000 of role-based pay in shares and a pension allowance of 363,000. He is also in line for payouts over the next three years and holds 14.4million-worth of shares.
THE ZEALOUS BARCLAYS BANKER KNOWN AS SAINT ANTONY
Antony Jenkins, who has been sacked as the boos of Barclays bank
He was known as St Antony for his zeal in trying to clean up Barclays. So perhaps it was always ominous that St Anthony of Padua is the patron saint of lost causes.
Antony Jenkins, who has been sacked as the boss of Barclays bank, was brought in to lead the high street lender in 2012. He replaced Bob Diamond, who fell on his sword in disgrace after the Libor-rigging scandal.
An earnest Oxford graduate from a modest background in Nantwich, Cheshire, Mr Jenkins earned his spurs in the British retail bank  not the risky investment side so beloved by Mr Diamond and his brash American sidekicks.
The 53-year-old was meant to be the antidote to the banks ill-fated attempts to ape Wall Streets biggest operators. It was thought he would help restore the Quaker values of Barclays founders some 300 years before.
The contrast between Mr Jenkins and the irrepressible Mr Diamond could not be greater. Jenkins is dryer than the Sahara on a dry day, said one executive. He is all logic, and no emotion, the Mr Spock of banking.
There is no one, with the possible exception of his wife and family, who has a connection with him. He is 100 per cent technocratic. Mr Jenkins tried to purge the lender of the toxic culture that prevailed in the Diamond years.
Posters sprang up at its Canary Wharf office, all starting with The one about in a reference to episode titles from the sitcom Friends. They featured examples of Barclays helping hard-pressed businesses.
But many of his initiatives  including the catchphrase I want to make Barclays the Go-To bank  were mocked as meaningless.
Mr Jenkins is married with two children and lives in west London. He began his career as a management trainee at Barclays and has also worked for Citigroup in New York.

The protest had been organised online, with demonstrators representing the Disabled People Against Cuts, Class War and Streets Kitchen movements all believed to be involved
David Peel, 55, from protest group Class War, said Mr Osborne's Budget was 'probably one of the worst budgets in living memory for poor people, for working class people and especially for the disabled'.
He added: 'This is about raising the profile of the opposition to the austerity and the opposition to the cuts which are hurting disabled people most.
'We will keep doing this until we win'.

Wearing a mask bearing the Chancellor's face he said: 'Osborne is about to unleash spending cuts in local government which will in effect end local government if nothing changes.'
Later the anti-austerity group People's Assembly will hold a series of rallies across the country, including London, Cardiff, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield.

	The court in southern Italy sentenced Berlusconi to three years in jail and banned him from holding any public office for five years, a judge said in a ruling shown live on television.

Prosecutors accused Berlusconi - who denies the charges - of bribing Sergio De Gregorio, a former senator in the small Italy of Values party, to switch allegiance in 2006 in a move that eventually helped topple the government of Berlusconi's arch rival, Romano Prodi.
De Gregorio admitted receiving 3 million euros (2.37million) from Berlusconi and attempting to persuade other senators to change sides. He was separately sentenced to 20 months in jail after a plea bargaining deal.
Berlusconi said he gave De Gregorio the money to help finance a new political movement.
Niccolo Ghedini, Berlusconi's lawyer, described it as a 'desperately unjust and unjustifiable ruling'.
Berlusconi finished in March a community service sentence tied to the tax fraud case, but fresh judicial woes are lapping at his feet.
A court in the southern city of Bari has ordered him to appear as a witness on Friday in the trial of seven defendants who are accused of procuring prostitutes for the ex-premier's alleged sex parties between 2008 and 2009.
Berlusconi's lawyer Niccolo Ghedini (pictured centre) described it as a 'desperately unjust and unjustifiable ruling'. Berlusconi was not in court today to hear the verdict
President of Naples court Serena Corleto (centre) sentences Berlusconi and co-defendant Valter Lavitola to three years in prison for bribing a senator
Earlier this year, Berlusconi was acquitted of having sex with an under-aged prostitute at the parties when the judge ruled it could not be proved that he knew the woman was just 17.
Last week, magistrates in Milan completed an investigation into suspicions key witnesses in the case were bribed, saying they believed Berlusconi gave 10 million euros to persuade various women to keep quiet.
Berlusconi has denied the accusations and a court will rule later this year whether to press further charges.
He was ousted as prime minister in 2011 in the midst of the euro zone financial crisis. He has repeatedly said he was forced from office as a result of a plot by European Union officials.

	Baby Samuel Harry was found already unconscious and very pale by the time an ambulance arrived at a two-storey terraced house in Bromham, on April 21, 2013.

He added: 'This is not just a child who fell off a chair. It could not have happened with normal frolicking or playing - otherwise hospitals would be full of children with this problem.
'It is indicative of something more than a simple impact here. The substantial injuries are indicative of a substantial blow to the brain. There could have been side to side or front-to-back shaking. Or he could have been swung around.'
Paramedics had rushed the toddler to Bedford Hospital, on April 21, 2013, accompanied by his mother and her partner but he died of his injuries, an inquest heard
Police have previously accepted either Miss Buffham or her lover Ryan Bate (pictured) was responsible for her child's death but the CPS has not prosecuted either of them as they each blamed each other
Mr Harry (with father Peter Harry, 62, and mother Vivien Harry, 60.) is has launched a petition calling on the CPS to change its mind
Dr Cary admitted there was no sign of significant bruising on Samuel's body but said comprehensive tests had shown no underlying medical condition like leukaemia or meningitis that might have been responsible for his death.
Police have previously accepted either Miss Buffham or her lover was responsible for her child's death but the CPS has not prosecuted either of them as they each blamed each other.
Samuel Harry had brain injuries so horrific they were similar to those found in a child who had 'fallen down a flight of stairs', an inquest has heard
Samuel's natural father Nick Harry, 30, is now campaigning for a review of that decision and has launched a petition calling on the CPS to change its mind.
Earlier, medic Roger Smith told the hearing at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, how Samuel was already unconscious and very pale by the time an ambulance arrived.
Mr Smith said: 'He was sat on a man's lap, wearing just a nappy and staring straight ahead vacantly.
'His heart rate was low and his blood pressure was raised. I was very concerned because he was obviously a very poorly child.'
AtBedford Hospital he was given a CT scan which showed a huge subdural haematoma had left the cavity between his brain and skull filled with blood.
Senior clinical fellow Dr K Naik said: 'This could have been caused by shaking of a child or it could have been a blow to the child's head. But there was no evidence of a blow.
'It would have had to have been a really good impact to cause that amount of bleeding and there was no evidence of a blow. It would have left a mark.
'There was no sign of physical injuries. There were no marks to his chin or face.'
Samuel was later transferred to Addenbrooke's at Cambridge where emergency neurosurgery was carried out in a bid to remove the swelling of his brain.
Consultant paediatrician Dr Diarmuid O'Donnell, who examined him the following morning, described how 'splodges of blood' in the youngster's eyes showed that he had been haemorrhaging.
He said: 'It was clear from very early on that Samuel was critically ill. It was very unlikely that he would survive. It was a grim situation. He'd had an horrendous night.'
Pathologist Dr Nathaniel Cary said the toddler 'could have been swung around' to suffer such substantial head trauma which had resulted in blood seeping into both his eyes
Medics had told the hearing at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, how Samuel was already unconscious and very pale by the time an ambulance arrived
Samuel was rushed to Bedford Hospital before being transferred to Addenbrooke's, Cambridge. After speaking to the mother, father and step-father, hospital staff stopped life support on April 22 and Sam died
Samuel was later transferred to Addenbrooke's at Cambridge where emergency neurosurgery was carried out in a bid to remove the swelling of his brain but tragically he later passed away
The lack of bruising and other tests that came back negative, he added, made 'the likelihood of an inflicted injury much more likely'.
Dr O'Donnell went on: 'It is highly likely from his condition that he had been subjected to an inflicted injury.'
Miss Buffham, 28, is due to appear at the inquest itomorrow via video link from Falkirk, Scotland.
Mr Bate, 23, who is believed to no longer be in a relationship with Miss Buffham, and his mother Sandra will be also giving evidence.
Buffham and Bate were remanded on police bail after Sam's death. They were released without charge last November.
It is believed they and Sam were the only people in the house that day, but both went out separately making it even harder to pin on one of them.
Mr Harry appealed the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to press charges but had it rejected in January.

He has launched a Justice for Sam petition to overturn the CPS' decision with his parents Peter and Vivien.
A CPS spokesman said, 'This case was reviewed as part of the Victims' Right to Review Scheme.
'A specialist prosecutor undertook an independent and comprehensive examination of the evidence.
'This review determined that the original decision to take no further action still stands because there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against either suspect.
'The charges of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child were considered.
'However, there is insufficient evidence to prove that either one of the suspects caused the little boy's injuries, or to prosecute them both on a joint enterprise basis.'
The inquest before Deputy Coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton Martin Oldham continues is expected to conclude on Thursday.

Surrey Police has released the CCTV footage of the moment the 23-year-old's BMW crashed through barriers on the southbound carriageway at the entrance to the Hindhead Tunnel on the A3.
Highways England employees and contractors were removing cones from behind the barriers in preparation for opening the road when the accident happened at 3.53am on February 17.
A Surrey Police spokesman said: 'Johns had, despite the numerous warning signs leading up to the tunnel, overtaken an HGV and pulled back in, making no attempt to stop.

'He then crashed through the barriers causing the road workers to fear for their safety.
'The HGV put on its hazard lights in advance of approaching the barrier, but Johns had failed to notice.'
Johns admitted under caution that he was the driver and later provided a positive breath sample of 61 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit being 35mg.

PC Tom Richardson said: 'This was a shocking incident which fortunately didn't lead to any serious injury or loss of life, as is sadly often the case when alcohol and driving are mixed.
'Driving while over the limit is simply unacceptable and severely affects a motorist's concentration levels which puts not only the driver at danger but other motorists and on this occasion the road workers who were lucky to escape harm.'
Surrey Police recently ran an anti-drink and drug driving campaign throughout June, during which 65 people were charged, with a further 31 drivers on bail pending further enquiries.

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: 'There was a collision between a Land Rover and some cyclists between Christow and Canonteign turning. Two cyclists have come off their bikes.
'One male has a head injury while the other man has cuts and bruises. Counter allegations have been made by the driver who is alleging that he was assaulted by a cyclist and we are making inquiries into what happened.'
No arrests have been made.
Jason Acreman, 35, from Torquay, Devon, claimed: 'I heard this beeping from a car and then heard screeching and skidding.
Police are now investigating the incident in Teign Valley in Devon after both the cyclists and Mr Atkinson claim they were injured
'I was riding by the hedge and had nowhere to go and was left upside down and hanging out of a tree. I was quite lucky really but do have a badly bruised hip, muscle damage, pain in my back and my shoulder is grazed.'
Fellow rider Rob Pierce said: 'We were riding single file along that road which is one of the few flat roads we can use. My main concern is that someone is going to be killed.
'We ride 200 miles a week and we are experienced riders. One of the injured riders was a stranger who suffered a head injury. An ambulance was called for him.
'We tried to speak to the driver about what had happened and he gave me his middle finger. I was giving him a piece of my mind that he could have killed people - women and children use this road - and he looked me in the eye and kept swearing at me.
'A lady driving the other way stopped and confronted him. She rang the police.
'He had a clear view of us but was revving and beeping his horn. My friend who was hurt has a three year old daughter, I have a son, people could have been killed.'

Labour's acting leader Harriet Harman responded to George Osborne's budget today - criticising his attacks on the low paid
Highlights of first Conservative budget in almost 20 years
Dave Penman, leader of the senior civil servants' union FSA, added: 'By restricting public sector pay rises to 1% for a further four years, the Chancellor is excluding public servants from the benefits of the economic recovery he spent so much time lauding this afternoon.
'Public servants are being asked to deliver a further 13 billion of spending cuts, yet many of them will be taking home less pay than they did in 2010.
'A further four years of pay restraint will do nothing to help recruit, reward and motivate the greatest asset the Government has: the people who deliver public services.
'The Chancellor said today that 'Britain deserves a pay rise and Britain is getting a pay rise'. Unless, of course, you're a public servant.'
Unison general secretary Dave Prentis slammed the public sector pay cap
But Mr Osborne said there was a 'simple trade-off between pay and jobs' in the public sector.
Delivering his first Tory budget he said: 'I know there has already been a period of pay restraint, but we said last autumn that commensurate savings in this parliament.
'To ensure we have public services we can afford and to protect more jobs we will continue restrict public sector pay awards with a rise of one per cent per year for the next four years.
'Public spending should reflect public priorities and we have to make choices.'
The announcement came before Mr Osborne announced plans to introduce a 'living wage', dramatically declaring that 'Britain deserves a pay rise'.
Hailing a new 'higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare' Britain, the Chancellor said from next April everyone over 25 would be entitled to 7.20 an hour - and the figure would rise to 9 by 2020.
Some six million people will see their pay increase as a result - and those currently earning the minimum wage of 6.50 an hour will be 5,000 better off by 2020, he claimed.
Mr Osborne said he was following the Conservative tradition as the party that brought in protections for mill workers during the industrial revolution.
'Taken together with all the welfare savings and the tax cuts in this Budget, it means that a typical family where someone is working full-time on the minimum wage will be better off,' Mr Osborne told MPs.
But acting Labour leader Harriet Harman responded by claiming the Budget was 'making working people worse off' by cutting tax credits for the low paid and grants for students from poorer backgrounds.
The announcement was the final flourish in an audacious package of reforms which amounted to the
The government spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, forecast that the new living wage will result in 60,000 fewer jobs, but the impact will be reduced because of corporation tax being cut to 18% by 2020.
The Low Pay Commission will be given responsibility for recommending future rises to the National Living Wage, with the remit that it should reach 60% of median earnings by 2020.
Mr Osborne said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) believed that even with the NLW there will still be one million more jobs in total by 2020.
'They also estimate that the cost to business will amount to just 1% of corporate profits. To offset that I have cut corporation tax to 18%,' he said.
'To help small firms I will go further now and cut their national insurance contributions.'

	Robert Fidler, 66, secretly constructed the mock-Tudor castle, in Salfords, Surrey, complete with battlements and cannons and lived there with his family from 2002.
      </Description>

But now the council has said it will proceed with contempt of court action which could land the furious farmer in jail unless he relinquishes the property.
Reigate and Banstead Borough Council's planning committee wrote to Mr Fidler after they met on Wednesday last week and decided to take action - and may even demolish the home for him.
But now the father-of-six, who also owns more than 100 cattle, claims even the new owner will not be able to destroy the country pile - because it is full of bats.
He said: 'I'm not going to prison, it's not mine any more. It's nothing to do with me. How can they put me in prison?
'The injunction is nothing to do with the property, it's to do with the person.
He hid his dream behind hay bales and tarpaulin for years butimmediately fell foul of local planning officers, who have repeatedly refused to grant retroactive planning permission
He has since sold the home. But now the father-of-six, who also owns more than 100 cattle, claims even the new owner will not be able to destroy the country pile - because it is full of bats
'When a judge issues an injunction he doesn't know what the future holds.
'He didn't know there was going to be bats there and it's illegal to move them.'
But the council insists Mr Fidler - who lives at the farm on Green Belt with wife Linda, 45, and son Harry, 14 - is responsible.
A spokesperson said that any sale 'doesn't change the fact that he is required to comply permanently with the requirements of the enforcement notices'.
They added: 'Furthermore, the Injunction Order explains that it is a contempt of court for any person notified of the Injunction Order knowingly to assist in or permit a breach of it.'
The home was meant to have been demolished on June 24 but he claims to have sold it a week earlier around the time he says an independent survey uncovered legally-protected bats in his attic.
He started building the mock castle in 2002 but kept it hidden from neighbours behind hay bales and tarpaulin until unveiling it in 2006.
The four-bedroom house, complete with chandeliers, would be worth well in excess of 1million if sold on the open market - but it must be pulled down within 90 days
Features include weathered brick and stone, carved wooden pillars and beams, and a stained-glass dome above the stairwell
He hoped that by concealing the he would exploit a loophole that meant if a construction last four years uncontested, authorities could not touch it.
But Reigate and Banstead Borough Council - which estimates it has spent 50,000 in its battle - refused to grant retrospective permission and he has since spent tens of thousands of pounds on numerous court hearings.
The Planning Inspectorate dismissed his appeals but last November he was granted temporary planning permission for a maximum of three years.
Mr Fidler believed he had won his battle but the permission was withdrawn by former Communities and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles who told him to tear it down.
He said: 'It's like going into a boxing ring with someone and when you start to when they pull out a gun and shoot you - you can't win. But it's in somebody else's hands now.
'They are adamant the property is there lawfully and they won't demolish it.
'They have written to me and said 'Don't touch it, I will sue if you demolish it'.
'If someone said to Picasso, 'Rip up your best oil painting' he wouldn't be able to do it.
'And neither can I. It's beautiful and I haven't broken any laws.'
The council spokesman said: 'At their meeting on Wednesday, July 1, the planning committee authorised officers to pursue contempt of court proceedings as the next step in seeking compliance with the injunction orders and outstanding enforcement notices.
'It is then entirely a matter for the court to decide the outcome.
'We hope that Mr Fidler will remove the building of his own accord, however the planning committee also authorised the council to take the required steps to seek permanent compliance with the injunction order, which could include direct action if it becomes necessary.'

'The tapping of natural resources, which are so abundant in Ecuador, must not be concerned with short-term benefits.'
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa has been harshly criticised by environmentalists and indigenous groups for pushing mining and oil drilling in the Amazon, which together with the Galapagos Islands make Ecuador one of the Earth's environmental priorities.
That push, coupled with high crude prices, allowed Correa to lift 1.3 million people out of poverty in his eight years in office.

	George Osborne replaces student grants with loans that graduates will pay back

	Maintenance grants, which are not currently paid back, will be replaced with students loans, which are paid back. School leavers will also be told to get a job or study in changes to the benefits system
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

'And to ensure universities are affordable to all students from all backgrounds we will increase the maintenance loan available to 8,200, the highest amount of support ever provided.
'To ensure our university system is sustainable, we will consult on freezing the loan repayment threshold for five years and will link the student fee cap to inflation for those institutions that can show they offer high-quality teaching.
'It is a major set of reforms to make sure Britain continues to have the best universities in the world. It is fair to students, fair to taxpayers and vital to secure our long-term economic future.'
He also said university tuition fee caps would be linked to inflation for institutions offering high-quality teaching.
Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary (left) secretary has been working on plans for the grants, which were unveiled in George Osborne's budget today
Changes to the welfare system mean under-21s will be expected to stay in education or get a job under new 'earn or learn' rules.
Mr Osborne said: 'It is not acceptable that some young people leave school straight into a life on benefits.
'Young people in the benefits system should face the same choices as other young people who do work but cannot afford to leave home.'
The plans for student grants will go down badly with student groups, who say that with fees having tripled to 9,000 a year, the prospect of getting into further debt will put off students from low-income families.
Megan Dunn, National Union of Student  President, said: 'Students living on beans and sketches about student poverty have become a punchline. But this isn't a joke, it's a national crisis.
'For our poorest students every day is a struggle. It is really important for them to have money in their pockets they know they are entitled to, and won't have to pay back. It gives them the confidence they need to succeed.'
Universities and College Union general secretary, Sally Hunt, added: 'Maintenance grants are crucial for engaging students from disadvantaged backgrounds who are already daunted by cripplingly high tuition fee debt.
'Increasing the debt burden on students will act as a disincentive to participation, and it does not make sense for the taxpayer either as the extra loan amount is unlikely to be repaid in full.'
Mr Osborne said the cost-cutting measures are necessary to ensure to the future health of British finances
She said that the level of financial support available should not be the deciding factor for a student choosing where to study.
Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust and the Education Endowment Foundation, warned that the reforms could put many low and middle income students off the idea of going to university.
He added: 'Since grants were reintroduced, there have been significant improvements in participation from full-time less advantaged students, and this will be put at risk by today's Budget plans.
'The reality is that the Government has miscalculated the levels of repayments it will get from its student loans under the new fees system. Rather than penalising poorer students, it should have a fundamental review of the repayments system. We need long-term solutions not a short-term fix.'
Under the previous system, full-time UK students from families with annual household incomes of 25,000 or less qualified for maintenance grants of 3,387 a year.
For families with incomes of 30,000, the grant fell to 2,441, while at 35,000 it was 1,494.
Anti-austerity protesters outside parliament today. The plans are likely to be unpopular with some students
Students from families with a household income of 40,000 received 547, and if the income was above 46,620 no amount was awarded. Unlike loans, the grants were not required to be repaid.
Whitehall officials proposed converting grants to loans two years ago, but the plans were abandoned due to opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who were concerned about further damage to their reputation with students after Nick Clegg's u-turn on tuition fees.
But as unprotected departments are faced with making budget cuts of around 15 per cent over the next three years to meet the Conservatives' targets to cut the deficit, the move will help Business Secretary Sajid Javid reach his goal of cutting 2.2bn.

US President Barack Obama urged Britain to meet its Nato requirement to spend 2 per cent of GDP on defence to counter the growing threat posed by Russian leader Vladimir Putin
Military spending will increase every year to help Britain's military keep up to date with the growing threat posed by Russia (pictured two RAF Tornados)
In addition, a joint security fund of 1.5 billion a year will be created by the end of the Parliament to pay for increased spending on the military and intelligence agencies.
The Chancellor also disclosed that the budget for the overall counter-terrorism effort - a total of more than 2 billion spent by a range of departments, agencies and the police, will be protected.
He added: 'I said that this was a Budget that delivered security to the people of Britain. And I said that we had to choose our priorities. Well, today, this government makes this choice.
'Committing to our armed forces who fight to keep us free. Committing to the intelligence agencies who keep us safe. Committing to the values we hold dear - and defend around the world.'
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was briefed on the budget commitment this morning
The budget also included funding for the Defence Medical Welfare Service and the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League.
Mr Osborne added: 'We're supporting the incredibly courageous members of our special forces who are injured and, in the 75th Anniversary of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, quadrupling the annual annuity we pay to those who demonstrated the highest valour and who I had the honour of meeting yesterday.'
Former Navy chief Admiral Lord West said he was 'absolutely delighted' that the Nato target will be met.
He said: 'That's got to be seen very much as a minimum. My only concern is what exactly is now included in that methodology compared to two years ago? I would like a very clear explanation.'
Lord West said it is crucial that the UK's military capability is enhanced, saying: 'It is a much more dangerous and unstable world.'
At Prime Minister's Questions ahead of the budget Mr Cameron faced pressure from the new Tory chairman of the Commons Defence Committee to guarantee military spending.
Tory Julian Lewis asked Mr Cameron whether Britain, should 'not be aiming at a 3 per cent target rather than the bare Nato minimum figure'.
Mr Cameron told MPs: 'We assess our defence spending constantly as to whether it meets our obligations and keeps our country safe. As figures published last month show we are meeting the 2 per cent Nato target this year.'
He added the only way to have strong defence 'is to have a strong economy'. The MP for New Forest East raised the issue of quantity in the armed forces.
Mr Lewis said: 'As the Prime Minister and indeed the Chancellor know, quality is not the issue with our armed forces, but quantity is.
'Given that we used to spend regularly between 4 and 5 per cent of GDP on defence when we last faced a threat on the Continent and a major terrorist campaign, should we not be aiming at a 3 per cent target rather than the bare Nato minimum figure?'
Mr Cameron replied: 'The point I would make to him - he is right we do face very severe threats in our world - is the only way to have strong defence is to have a strong economy, that is absolutely key.
'We made some very clear commitments about the size of our armed forces, about the successor to the Trident submarine and also the vital equipment programme, where we have the aircraft carriers and the other equipment vital to our armed services that are coming through.
'Those things are only possible because we closed the deficit in our MoD, and the mess that we found when we became the Government and we have a strong economy.'

Osborne stuns rivals with new National Living Wage
George Osborne outmanoeuvred his political opponents today with the shock creation of a new National Living Wage.
The Chancellor had been stung by criticism in recent weeks that his plan to cut tax credits paid to top up low wages would hit poor working families.
Instead, he announced that from April next year employers will have to pay everyone over 25 at least 7.20 an hour - rising 9 by 2020.
George Osborne was congratulated by David Cameron after unveiling his Budget designed to make work pay
Some six million people will see their pay increase as a result - and those currently earning the minimum wage of 6.50 an hour will be 5,000 better off by 2020, he claimed.
Mr Osborne said he was following the Conservative tradition as the party that brought in protections for mill workers during the industrial revolution.
'Taken together with all the welfare savings and the tax cuts in this Budget, it means that a typical family where someone is working full-time on the minimum wage will be better off,' Mr Osborne told MPs.
Mr Osborne also ruled out reducing the top rate of tax for those earning more than 150,000 from 45p to 40p.
London Mayor Boris Johnson this week warned Britain's richest bosses should not get a tax cut until they pay their workers properly.
He said the idea of cutting the top rate of tax cannot be supported until business leaders pay their staff a living wage which means they do not have to rely on welfare to top up their income.
A study by Citizens UK this year showed that there were 5.2million low paid workers in supermarkets and shops the UK, receiving 11billion in state support through tax credits.
It is argued that if their firms paid them the Living Wage instead of the minimum wage it would save the taxpayer 6.7billion in benefits.
CitizensUK suggested that workers at five of the country's biggest retailers  Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Next  receive 1billion-a-year in taxpayer-funded subsidies topping up their low wages.
Some businesses have already adopted the voluntary Living Wage of 7.85 an hour (9.15 in London), rather than the adult national minimum wage of 6.50.

Income tax cuts for 29million a 'for a country on the up'
Almost 30million people were promised an income tax cut as George Osborne brought forward help for low earners and the middle classes.
From next April workers will be able to earn 11,000 before paying tax, a year earlier than planned.
And the threshold for paying the 40p tax rate will rise from 42,385 to 43,000, taking 130,000 people out of the higher rate of income tax altogether.
From April next year the amount workers can earn without paying income tax will rise to 11,000, a year earlier than planned
In their election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to increase the amount workers can earn before paying income tax to 12,500 by 2020.
David Cameron also set out a new law to ensure that someone working for 30 hours on the minimum wage paid no income tax at all.
When the coalition was formed in 2010, the personal tax allowance was 6,475 but was increased gradually to hit 10,600 this year.
It was due to rise to 11,000 by April 2017 but will now happen from April 2016.
Mr Osborne said: 'That's 11,000 you can earn before paying any income tax at all  boosting wages by over 900 in total  and a down payment on our goal of reaching 12,500.
'We will now legislate so that after that the personal allowance always rises in line with the minimum wage, and we never ask the lowest paid in our society to pay income tax.'
The Chancellor has also been under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to act on the growing number of people dragged into paying the 40p tax rate.
David Cameron has said it was wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was 'only ever meant for the better off'.
Since 2010-11 the number of people paying the 40p rate has risen from 3million to 4.65million this year.
Mr Osborne said increasing the threshold to 43,000 from next year 'marks a strong start to our commitment to raise the threshold to 50,000'.
He said: 'It will lift 130,000 people out of the higher rate of income tax altogether.'
He added: 'A personal allowance of 11,000.A higher rate threshold of 43,000.29 million people paying less tax.A downpayment for a country on the up.'

Inheritance tax threshold to rise to 1million for family homes
Honouring a pledge announced eight years ago, George Osborne confirmed today that all but the richest will now be able to pass on their homes to their children without a huge tax bill
Families will not have to pay inheritance tax on homes worth up to 1million, under long-promised Conservative reforms.
Honouring a pledge announced eight years ago, George Osborne confirmed today that all but the richest will now be able to pass on their homes to their children without a huge tax bill.
The Chancellor also unveiled provisions that mean people who downsize will not lose out.
The change will come into effect in 2017 and ensures that 94 per cent of families will pay no inheritance tax at all.
Mr Osborne said: 'The wish to pass something on to your children is about the most basic, human and natural aspiration there is.'
He told MPs inheritance tax had been designed to be paid by the very rich, but was now hitting ordinary families.
He said: 'Today there are more families pulled into the inheritance tax net than ever before  and the number is set to double over the next five years. It's not fair and we will act.'
Mr Osborne said his reforms meant 'no more inheritance tax on family homes', adding: 'Aspiration supported, the tax paid only by the rich, the security of home ownership restored - promise made  promise delivered.'
Inheritance tax is currently levied at 40 per cent on assets above 325,000 for a single person or 650,000 for a married couple.
Mr Osborne has increased that threshold to 500,000 for singletons and 1million for married couples.
The increased amount however will apply only to the value of the main home, and not to other sources of wealth.
Polls have found that death duties are the most unpopular of all taxes  even among Labour voters.
Because the threshold has stood still as property prices have risen it is affecting record numbers of families.
In March's budget, Mr Osborne unveiled forecasts showing the number of estates hit was on course to almost double from 35,000 in 2014/15 to 64,000 to 2019/20.

Welfare cuts: Tax credits slashed and FOUR year benefit freeze
Tax credits slashed and benefits frozen for FOUR years: Osborne cuts 12bn from welfare but admits it will take TWICE as long as planned to make the savings
George Osborne froze benefits for four years and took an axe to tax credits today, but admitted it would take twice as long as originally planned to find 12billion in welfare savings.
The Chancellor, delivering the first Tory budget in almost 20 years, said he wanted to turn Britain into a 'high wage, low welfare' economy.
The amount workless families can claim in benefits will be cut to 23,000 in London and the South East, and 20,000 for the rest of the country, well below the average annual salary of workers in every part of the UK
He announced that tax credits would be cut by 9billion and limited to a family's first two children, while in-work benefits will kept at today's levels until 2019/20.
The amount households can receive in benefits will also be limited to a maximum of 20,000 a year outside London and 23,000 in the capital.
The Chancellor also stripped under 21s from receiving housing benefit and slashed Employment and Support Allowance for those too sick to work by 30 a week.
Taken together, the benefit cuts will save 12billion by 2019/20 - two years later than Mr Osborne promised in the Conservative manifesto.
The Chancellor insisted the benefit cuts were needed to secure Britain's 'economic security'. He told MPs: 'If we are to build a more productive economy, and our country is to live within its means, then we have to make this fundamental change.
'Welfare spending is not sustainable and it crowds out spending on things like education and infrastructure that are vital to securing the real welfare of the people.'
Mr Osborne warned the scale of tax credits was not sustainable and major reforms and cuts were needed
To make 12 billion in welfare savings Mr Osborne unveiled a series of benefit cuts, including plans to:
Force those aged between 18 and 21 to either 'earn or learn'
Strip housing benefit from under 21s
Cut Employment and Support Allowance  paid to people too ill to work  by over 30 a week.
Freeze working age benefits for four years
Cap the total amount of benefits a family can take home in benefits to 20,000 outside London and 23,000 in the capital
Mr Osborne said the cuts we designed to put the welfare budget 'on a sustainable footing'.
He said: 'In 1980, working age welfare accounted for 8 per cent of all public spending. Today it is 13 per cent.
'The original Tax Credit system cost 1.1 billion in its first year. This year, that cost has reached 30 billion. We spend more on family benefits in Britain than Germany, France or Sweden.'
Mr Osborne said this was simply 'not sustainable'.
The Chancellor also reduced the benefit cap from 26,000 to 23,000 in London, and 20,000 in the rest of the country.
He said confirmed a crack down on middle class families living in council houses with cheap rent.
The Chancellor told MPs: 'We are also going to require those on higher incomes living in social housing to pay rents at the market rate.
'It's not fair that families earning over 40,000 in London, or 30,000 elsewhere, should have their rents subsidised by other working people.

Tory delight as Osborne vows to spend 2% of GDP on defence
Britain will meet the Nato spending target for defence, George Osborne has announced.
The Chancellor committed the Government to spending 2 per cent of national income on the military every year of the decade and raising the Ministry of Defence's budget by 0.5 per cent a year in real terms.The announcement ended months of speculation over the pledge.
Until now, ministers had not committed the UK to spending at that level beyond the current financial year - prompting pressure from backbench MPs and military chiefs.
ritain will meet the Nato spending target for defence, George Osborne has announced to the delight of Tory MPs
Mr Osborne said: 'The Prime Minister and I are not prepared to see the threats we face to both our country and our values go unchallenged.
'Britain has always been resolute in defence of liberty and the promotion of stability around the world. And with this government it will always remain so.
'So today I commit additional resources to the defence and security of the realm.'
Announcing the 2 per cent commitment, he added: 'We will ensure that this commitment is properly measured, because we know that while those commitments don't come cheap, the alternatives are far more costly.'
The Ministry of Defence's budget will rise by 0.5 per cent above inflation every year until 2020-21.
In its budget policy document, the Government says it remains committed to maintaining the size of the Army at 82,000.
In addition, a joint security fund of 1.5 billion a year will be created by the end of the Parliament to pay for increased spending on the military and intelligence agencies.
The Chancellor also disclosed that the budget for the overall counter-terrorism effort - a total of more than 2 billion spent by a range of departments, agencies and the police, will be protected.
The move was cheered by Tory MPs in the House of Commons who have called for the pledge to be made.

10,000 thank-you for heroes given George and Victoria Crosses
Britain's most remarkable heroes are to be handed a 10,000-a-year 'thank you' from the nation, George Osborne announced.
Thirty holders of the Victoria Cross and George Cross already qualify for a 2,129-a-year annual stipend from the state in recognition of their bravery.
The Chancellor has now ruled that this should be increased to 10,000.
Mr Osborne yesterday met Victoria Cross and George Cross winners during a reception at 11 Downing Street
The 3 million cost of the tax-free payment will be funded by fines levied on the banks for misconduct.
Mr Osborne, who met holders of the two medals in Downing Street yesterday, said: 'These inspirational people have gone above and beyond for this country and it is only right that we do all we can to support them.
'That's why I am so pleased to commit an extra 3 million to the holders of the Victoria Cross and the George Cross in the Budget. It is quite right that we use the bank fines from those who demonstrated the worst of values to support those who have shown the best of British values.'
The Victoria Cross is the highest military award for bravery. It is often awarded posthumously, and there are only 10 living holders.
The George Cross is the civilian equivalent for gallantry. Awards are rare and there are only 20 living recipients.
Yesterday's guests at Downing Street included Johnson Beharry, who was awarded the VC for 'supreme courage' in Iraq, when he twice rescued fellow soldiers under intense fire, and Bill Speakman, who was awarded the VC after leading repeated grenade charges against the enemy despite being wounded.

Shops to open for longer on Sundays to boost trade
Sunday trading restrictions could be axed under plans to announced in the Budget.
The Chancellor wants to hand power to councils and elected mayors to scrap some or all of the rules governing the opening hours of larger stores on Sundays.
The move has been welcomed by many supermarkets, garden centres and other large retailers, who have warned for years that the restrictions from 1994 are out of date and unfair.
The government will hand power to councils and elected mayors to scrap some or all of the rules governing the opening hours of larger supermarkets on Sundays
But it has put the Chancellor on a collision course with church groups and trade unions who want Sunday to be treated as a special day.
At the moment, large stores can only open for six hours between 10am and 6pm on Sundays, while shops with a floor area of less than 3,000 square feet can open all day.
Mr Osborne said that changes in shopping patterns meant it was time to look at the restrictions again.
The Chancellor said this would let towns and cities 'determine their own futures'. The Treasury is expected to consult on whether to devolve power over Sunday trading laws to elected mayors, or whether all local authorities should be included.
Asda boss Andy Clarke said in February that the existing laws were 'fundamentally wrong' because those who wanted to shop at other times had to pay more for their food.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said lifting the restrictions on Sunday opening would 'take precious family time away from shop workers'.
She said: 'There is no pressure for this from shoppers and it may push some smaller retailers out of business.
'It's a sign of desperation that the Chancellor is trying to strengthen growth through shopping instead of manufacturing. We need a better economic plan than asking people to spend another day of the week putting debt on their credit cards.'

30million to speed up adoption of children in council care
Funding will be provided to help thousands of children in local authority care to be adopted by new parents.
Ministers argue it is a 'tragedy' that so many children ready for adoption were forced to wait months or years to join a loving home.
The Budget provides 30million to councils to 'tear down the barriers' and accelerate the process for some 3,000 children waiting to be adopted.
George Osborne argues it is a 'tragedy' that so many children ready for adoption were forced to wait months or years to join a loving home
More than half of these children have been in care for at least 18 months while a new family is found, despite a national surplus of potential adoptive parents.
The money will used to waive the fees which local authorities must pay to adoption agencies for finding, assessing and matching an adoptive parent and child outside their catchment area.
A 27,000 fee is paid for an adoptive parent found from outside a local authority's border, either by another local authority or by one of 30 voluntary sector adoption agencies.
Ministers believe these steep costs prevent councils from looking far and wide for potential parents for children in their care, particularly those that are least likely to find a new home.
Since 2010, the number of children adopted has increased from 3,200 to 5,050 by last year. The average time it took to place a child with adoptive parents fell from an average of 656 days in 2012/13 to 533 days in 2013/14.

Ever-rising green taxes to be scrapped to curb energy bills
Environmental taxes subsidise wind farms and other green energy sources by increasing household bills
A review of green taxes and subsidies will be launched in a bid to clamp down on runaway energy bills.
Environmental taxes subsidise wind farms and other green energy sources by increasing household bills.
Under the Coalition the government had a target to increase the proportion of tax raised from environmental levies  a commitment that also featured in the Conservative manifesto five years ago.
But ministers are concerned that the bill to subsidise low-carbon energy, which is added to business and household electricity bills, has spiralled out of control.
The Department for Energy and Climate Change budgeted for 7.6billion to subsidise wind farms, nuclear plants and solar power by 2020.
But on current trends it could reach 9billion  or 170 on an annual household bill.
But the Chancellor has signalled a major change in direction  setting out plans to reduce in the longer term the amount families and businesses are expected to funnel into renewable energy schemes through their energy bills.
The review of green taxes and subsidies underlines David Cameron's shift away from longer-term environmental goals during his time in office.
In 2010 the PM promised 'vote blue, go green' but has since watered down his green commitments

Student grants for the poor to be axed and replaced with loans
Student grants will be axed and replaced with loans, under plans being announced in today's Budget.
Sajid Javid, the Business Secretary, has been working on plans for the grants  worth up to 3,387 per year this September  to be paid back after a student graduates.
Maintenance grants, which are means-tested, cover a students' rent and living costs at university and are intended to help those from poorer backgrounds.
Order called as Harriet Harman brings up minimum wage
Student grants will be axed and replaced with loans, which students will pay back once they have graduated
But they already cost 1.6billion a year of the Business department's 13billion budget. Officials are concerned that the grant budget could double over the course of the Parliament.
The proposal will go down badly with student groups, who say that with fees having tripled to 9,000 a year, the prospect of getting into further debt will put off students from low-income families.
Grants are available for students with a family income of up to 42,620 a year. One option is keep them only for students with a family income of under 25,000 who are eligible for the maximum grant.
Whitehall officials proposed converting grants to loans two years ago, but the plans were abandoned due to opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who were concerned about further damage to their reputation with students after Nick Clegg's u-turn on tuition fees.
But as unprotected departments are faced with making budget cuts of around 15 per cent over the next three years to meet the Conservatives' targets to cut the deficit, the move will help Mr Javid reach his goal of cutting 2.2billion.

BBC to pay 650million for free TV licences for the over-75s
The BBC has agreed to cover the cost of providing free TV licences for 4.5million over-75s - saving the government 650million a year from 2020.
In return legislation will be brought forward in the next year to 'modernise the licence fee' - allowing BBC bosses to begin charging for the iPlayer.
The annual charge - currently set at 145.50 a year - will also rise by around 10 by 2020 helping the BBC recoup around 250million.
Legislation will be brought forward in the next year to 'modernise the licence fee' - allowing BBC bosses to begin charging for the iPlayer
A deal has also been struck to let the BBC decide whether or not to continue funding the free licence perk after the next election.
Culture Secretary John Whittingdale said the Government was pleased the broadcaster had agreed to 'play its part in contributing to reductions in spending like much of the rest of the public sector' while further reducing its 'reliance on taxpayers'.
George Osborne said the BBC needed to make savings like every other publicly-funded body.
He said: 'The deal we have agreed with the Corporation means that it will take on the significant cost of TV licences for the over-75s, easing some of the pressure on taxpayers who have to meet the country's welfare bill, while also ensuring that our promise to maintain pensioner benefits is met in full over the next five years.'
BBC Director-General Tony Hall, said it was the 'right deal for the BBC in difficult economic circumstances for the country'.
The BBC could recoup a lot of the money from the rising number of households each paying the licence fee.
The 650million bill is more than 10 times the cost of Radio 1 (52million) and Radio 2 (60million), while hit shows like The Voice cost 55million over five years.
Big name stars are also expensive. Chris Evans has reportedly been handed a 3million deal to host Top Gear for three years alongside presenting the Radio 2 breakfast show, while Graham Norton and Gary Lineker are both said to earn more than 2million.

Can George Osborne can write like an injket printer?
As Chancellor of the Exchequer, writing the Budget speech is one of the biggest parts of George Osborne's job.
But he was mocked online this morning after posting a picture online which appeared to show him writing in a perfect Times New Roman font.
Mr Osborne tweeted the picture of his Budget speech, but social media users were quick to point out that the sheet of paper in front of him had been typed and not handwritten.
George Osbornewas mocked online this morning after posting a picture online which appeared to show him writing in a perfect Times New Roman font

In a tweet posted online this morning, Mr Osborne said: 'Today I will present a Conservative Budget - a Budget that puts economic security first.'
The picture was taken at his desk in Number 11 Downing Street, with his official red leather folder to his left and the red Budget book to his right.
While Mr Osborne hoped to communicated the message behind his Budget measures, some on Twitter were more interested in what he was doing with his pen.
Andrew Wilson asked: 'Why is Osborne holding a pen in this photo? Is that supposed to be his handwriting? Or is he colouring in the O's?'
Benjamin Partridge wrote: 'George Osborne can write Times New Roman with a pen!'
Dave W added: 'That awkward moment when you're George Osborne and your pen is an inkjet printer.'
'GIRLS? GIRLS!':  NICKY MORGAN HITS OUT AT NO.10 PHOTOGRAPHER

As the government's minister for women, Nicky Morgan has attacked misogynistic attitudes holding back female equality.
But the top Tory cabinet minister, who is also the Education Secretary, appeared to take the fight against 'everyday sexism' into her own hands today after slapping down a photographer who shouted at her as she left Downing Street.
As Mrs Morgan walked out of Number 10 with the Energy Secretary Amber Rudd this morning, a photographer attempted to get her attention by shouting 'morning girls'.
The Education Secretary snapped back 'Girls?! Girls!' before appearing to win an apology from the photographer.
REVEALED: GEORGE'S SECRET TWITTER WAR WITH THE LIB DEMS
Just four months ago, George Osborne and his Lib Dem number two Danny Alexander stood together in Downing Street ahead of their last Coalition budget.
But the relationship between the Chancellor and his former allies appears to have dramatically soured after it emerged he had officially 'blocked' the Lib Dems on his official Twitter account.
Mr Osborne's decision, which means the Lib Dems cannot view any of his Twitter messages, was ridiculed this morning.
One party source said: 'You would've thought he had much greater things to worry about on Budget day than the Lib Dem press office.
'He must have seen something from us he didn't like and decided to block us. It's rather daft. It gives you a bit of an insight into his state of mind.'

        <Description>
	Neighbours Professor Martin Cranage and Judge Keith Cutler - who oversaw the high-profile Mark Duggan inquest - had been locked in a dispute over the former's radio aerial at his home in rural Wiltshire.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
Prof Cranage - who is leading the fight to find a vaccine for HIV - also has to ensure feeder cables are routed correctly through the side of the house in a village on Salisbury Plain.
Mrs Cutler had written to Wiltshire Council planners to complain about the radio aerial.
She wrote: 'One concern is that whilst the application states the dimension of the aerial it also states that an alternative may be installed from time to time.
'On 16/6/15 an aerial which appeared to be of considerably greater dimensions was temporarily installed. If planning permission is granted what control will there be over the size of any future potentially larger installation?
'A second concern is that of sound interference which has occurred through the internet. What plans are there to ensure this does not happen in future?'
Allowed to stay: The dispute was eventually hauled before council planners, where Prof Cranage, an amateur radio enthusiast, was told he could keep the aerial he put up without planning possession
Although Wiltshire Council granted retrospective permission for the professor to keep the aerial, a report stated: 'One neighbour has written in regarding the application stating that whilst they have no objections to the aerial they are concerned a larger aerial may be erected in the future. This would require further planning permission.'
Prof Cranage said: 'I am absolutely delighted. It seems a common sense decision.
'My application said I could alter it but not to a larger size. They have agreed with that condition which was self imposed.
'I believe the great majority of my neighbours are satisfied with the resolution.'
I am absolutely delighted. It seems a common sense decision
Professor Martin Cranage
Recorder of Winchester, Judge Cutler, has stayed tight lipped about the controversy
But after she wrote to Wiltshire Council Mrs Cutler admitted it was right there were concerns over it affecting the Internet connection.
She said: 'What I said is fair enough. I am not making any further comment but it is me making the comment not my husband.'
Prof Cranage had to get planning permission because the aerial was 4ft too high on his roof. He put up the aerial himself
The planning dispute started when a council official inspected the 100 aerial while Prof Cranage was sick in hospital.
A member of the public had told Wiltshire Council that Prof Cranage had allegedly breached planning rules. It was then confirmed planning permission was required. The council also said the aerial was nine and a half feet too wide.
The professor has just retired from St Georges Medical School in London but is still actively involved in HIV research.
He has been an amateur radio enthusiast since his student days - and he and his wife have 40 years' transmitting experience.

The move by the Chancellor has also brought joy to many in the Tory ranks, who feel that by promoting policies to help those on low pay, they are undermining Labour's claim to be the party of the 'working poor'.
Mr Osborne used his speech to pay tribute to Mr Iain Duncan Smith's work on reform welfare, marvelling at his 'Herculean efforts'.
Mr Duncan Smith is also keen to dispel claims he is a 'Sheriff of Nottingham' figure, when he has always insisted he is battling to 'make work pay'.
The Work and Pensions Secretary's reaction sparked a flurry of internet jokes at his expence
Mr Osborne said of the plans: 'Working people aged 25 and over will receive it. It will start next April, at the rate of 7.20.
'The Low Pay Commission will recommend future rises that achieve the Government's objective of reaching 60% of median earnings by 2020.
'That is the minimum level of pay recommended in the report to the Resolution Foundation by Sir George Bain - chair of the Low Pay Commission.'
'Let me address the impact on business and employment. The OBR today say that the new national living wage will have, in their words, only a 'fractional' effect on jobs.'
Mr Osborne added: 'The OBR have assessed the economic conditions of the country, and all the policies in the Budget. They say that by 2020 there will be 60,000 fewer jobs as a result of the national living wage but almost one million more in total.'
The former Tory leader, who has been working to reform the benefits system, shouted: 'Fantastic, Get in!'
His jubilation came as the level of noise in the chamber reached deafening levels, with the Chancellor forced to stop speaking
The announcement follows a report by KPMG earlier this week which said that paying the living wage rather than the statutory minimum would only cost 1.3% of the national wage bill and bring in 4.5 billion in taxes and reduced benefit payments.
KPMG said it had calculated for the first time the impact of adopting the current higher rate of 7.85 an hour (9.15 in London), compared with the adult national minimum wage of 6.50.
The professional services firm said companies that adopted the living wage had reported 'clear benefits' to their businesses.

	The Federated States of Micronesia suffered their third record defeat when they were thrashed 46-0 by Vanuatu in an Olympic qualifying tournament on Tuesday.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>3.8k shares
Thumbs up: Vanuatu's top scorer Jean Kaltack bagged an astonishing 16 goals during the match
'A bit of criticism I got before we left was [for] picking a younger squad, but it's no use picking older players who won't be around for the next four [years].'
'Most of them have never been out of their villages let alone on to another island. I took them to Guam the other day (and it was) the first time they've been on an elevator or an escalator.'
'It's been a huge step-up for these guys and they've just been overawed really.'
Those villages Foster refers to are on four island states spread across 60 miles in the western Pacific Ocean - Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae.
They sit about 1,800 miles north of the eastern Australian coast and about 2,500 miles southwest of the main islands of Hawaii.
The islands, which use American currency because it is a U.S. 'associated state,' have no organized football and often only get practice matches against teams from visiting ships.
They are not a member of the Oceania confederation or FIFA, so their only funding to help develop their approximately 500 mostly school-age players comes from international agencies like the U.N.
Couldn't keep track: At one point during the match the official score keeper temporarily left his seat. It wasn't an ideal move as Vanuatu bagged a goal on average once every two minutes during the match
Chaos: Members of the crowd struggled to keep up with the ever-increasing scoreline
Foster said most of his team played in only seven-a-side teams and that the Pacific Games marked the first time many of them played on a pitch with 11 players.
The Pacific Games is an under-23 tournament, so the scores won't count as any type of international record for most goals scored in a match.
That mark still belongs to Australia: Archie Thompson scored 13 goals when the Socceroos beat American Samoa 31-0 in 2001 in an Oceania qualifying match for the 2002 World Cup.
Social media wasn't around in 2001 to help spread news of the big Australian win, and predictably Twitter was active with news of the huge Micronesian losses.
With a team made up of largely teenage players, many of whom have left their home villages for the first time, Micronesia suffered the steepest of learning curves in the Pacific Games soccer tournament
Despite winning the match 46-0, Vanuatu were actually eliminated from the tournament as results elsewhere went against them
Having a good time: Speaking after the match, Micronesia coach Stan Foster said he wasn't surprised by the result and admitted his players 'didn't have high expectations'
The official Pacific Games website even re-tweeted a note from a New Zealand radio network which pointed out that Micronesia conceded more goals in three matches than Lionel Messi has scored in the past two years -84.
'These are a team of boys and they're playing against men,' Foster said after his team's final lopsided loss.'But the makings are there. If we just to stick to our development I'm sure we can join the other teams.'
'We didn't have high expectations,' Foster added, admitting that he told his players before they left they left not to worry about the scores of any of their matches.
Which, as it turned out, was probably a good thing.
MICRONESIA: BREATHTAKING BEAUTY IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC
The Federated States of Micronesia consists of more than 600 tiny islands scattered across a vast space in the western Pacific Ocean.
Located northeast of Papua New Guinea and east of The Philippines, these islands are divided into four states - Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei and Kosrae.
While its total land area is small, the islands are spread across an area five times the size of France.
With a population of 106,000, it depends heavily on foreign aid mostly contributed by the U.S. and many live in small, isolated villages without running water or electricity.
Due to its remoteness, unemployment is high. While its beautiful scenery forms an attractive destination for tourists, the industry has struggled to boom due to the islands' remoteness.

Original features: The vehicle is being sold unrestored - and previous models have fetched huge sums at auction
Last year, another 1967 Toyota - this one fully restored - sold for more than $1million.
At the time, RM Sothebys wrote that the 2000 GT was introduced to the world at the 1965 Tokyo Motor Show as its makers looked to muscle in on the two-seater sports coupe market.
The auction house said on its website: 'There is no question that the 2000GT holds a very important place in automotive history.
'Although it didnt see instant success when new, it was clear that this Toyota made a huge impact far away from its home country and it put the established European and North American automotive manufacturers on notice.'

On July 7th, Mr Bolin was discharged from hospital, but has to return for check ups and chemotherapy appointments. He is planning to move in with his mother in central Stockholm
I feel so afraid and worried for my life right now. I dont feel like I deserve to die just yet, I have so much more to do and so many goals to fulfill,' Mr Bolin wrote on his blog. He is pictured before his diagnosis

The chemotherapy treatment will wreck his immune system and leave him infertile, doctors have said.
My last healthy sons and daughters are now stored away for me and my future special one, should I make it through this, he writes.
In his latest post he said  he has now been allowed to leave hospital,  returning for check ups and chemotherapy appointments.
He plans to move in with his mother in central Stockholm, something he says he would not have previously considered.
He wrote: 'This is something I never saw myself doing again; to move home.
Ive always seen myself as an adventurer and conqueror with no fear on my mind, but right now I couldnt feel a stronger need to be safe with the people that love me the most, my parents.
He attaches a picture of him signing out for hospital, as well as another of his mother holding him as a baby.
He signs off his blog post with the news that tomorrow he will return to hospital to find out how his body is reacting to the treatment.

	Jersey MP Steve Pallet goes to BUDAPEST instead of Bucharest after booking error
      </title>

	Jersey politician Steve Pallett missed the handover of the Dance World Cup to the island when he flew to Budapest in Hungary, instead of Bucharest in Romania.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share

The booking had been made by someone within the Education, Sport and Culture department, a spokesman said, adding it was 'human error'.
Mr Pallett, assistant minister of both the Economic Development and Planning and Environment departments, said the department should have been more careful when the flight was booked.
Pallet was due to receive a flag from the Romanian hosts of the Dance World Cup event in Bucharest (above)
'It is really disappointing, I have to apologise for wasting taxpayers' money and for letting down the Dance World Cup,' he said.
'I don't know the exact cost as I've still got some figures to come back, but it won't be less than 1,000. All I can do is apologise for what is a schoolboy error, the last thing I needed was a day trip to Budapest after a long week supporting the Island Games.'
He was supposed to make a speech and accept the flag on behalf of nearly 3,000 competitors from 32 countries, including England, Northern Ireland and Wales.
He had been heavily involved in the Island Games, a multi-sport competition similar to the Olympics, that was being held in Jersey the week before.
The Dance World Cup will be held in Jersey in 2016 but Mr Pallett missed the flag handover
It's not the first time a geographical mix up has caused embarrassment.
Earlier this year a medical student attempted to fly to Guyana to begin his scholarship but ended up nearly 2,000 miles away in the Brazilian city of Goiania.
In 2013 Lamenda Kingdon, a British woman, had planned a visit to the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain. Instead she mistakenly caught a flight across the Atlantic to the tropical Caribbean island of Grenada.
Also in 2013 Sandy Valdiviseo and her husband Triet Vo were intending to fly from Los Angeles to Dakar in Senegal with Turkish Airlines. However, instead they ended up almost 7,000 miles away  on an entirely different continent  in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, after the airport codes were mixed up.
The stories were widely reported across all media, leaving both travellers and booking companies more than a little red-faced.

	Tunisia Prime Minister Habib Essid said the barrier would stretch inland from the Mediterranean coast which has become a new breeding ground for the Islamic State and other terror groups.

Mr Essid told state TV the wall would be built be by the army, with surveillance centres spaced along it and would be completed by the end of the year, according to the BBC .
Security has also been stepped up massively since the Sousse attack, with more than 1,400 armed officers deployed at hotels and beaches.
Earlier this week,Tunisia's president admitted his country was 'not safe' and  at risk of 'collapse' following two the deadly terror attacks in the past three months.

The British Ambassador to Tunisia, Hamish Cowell (left) and Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid (second left) attend a memorial ceremony and a minute's silence at the site of a terror attack on a beach outside the Imperial Marhaba Hotel, in the tourist resort of Sousse earlier this month
Declaring the urgent reinstatement of 30 days of security measures that were lifted in March last year, Beji Caid Essebsi said terrorists pose an existential threat to the North African nation.
Speaking over the weekend, Essebsi said the state of emergency would last 30 days.
In a nationwide televised address, the president officially reintroduced urgent security measures for Tunisia that had been lifted in early 2014.
Essebsi blamed the poor security in Libya for Tunisia's problems, and the lack of international resolve in targeting the Islamic State group throughout the region.
He said Tunisia specifically had been a target of the extremist group because it had a functioning, secular democracy.
Tunisia's government has promised new laws to increase police powers and provide for harsher penalties for terrorism convictions. Immediately after the Sousse attack, the prime minister pledged to post armed guards at tourist sites and close mosques outside government control.
The country was under a state of emergency from January 2011, at the outbreak of the Arab Spring, until March 2014.
It initially included a curfew and a ban on meetings of more than three people.
Although those measures were relaxed, police and the military retained powers to intervene in unrest or for security reasons.

	Budget 2015 unveils tax cuts for 29m people and vows 'higher wage, lower tax'

	From next April workers will be able to earn £11,000 before paying tax, a year earlier than planned to let working people 'keep more of the money they earn', the Chancellor said.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share

Mr Osborne said: 'That's 11,000 you can earn before paying any income tax at all  boosting wages by over 900 in total  and a downpayment on our goal of reaching 12,500.
'We will now legislate so that after that the personal allowance always rises in line with the minimum wage, and we never ask the lowest paid in our society to pay income tax.'
The Chancellor has also been under intense pressure from Conservative MPs to act on the growing number of people dragged into paying the 40p tax rate.
Mr Cameron has said it was wrong that millions of people doing normal jobs like teaching are now paying a tax rate that was 'only ever meant for the better off'.
Budget: New Fiscal Charter for country to run budget surplus
Since 2010-11 the number of people paying the 40p rate has risen from 3million to 4.65million this year. The Tories are committed to increasing the threshold from 42,385 to 50,000 by 2020
Since 2010-11 the number of people paying the 40p rate has risen from 3million to 4.65million this year.
Mr Osborne said increasing the threshold to 43,000 from next year 'marks a strong start to our commitment to raise the threshold to 50,000'.
He said: 'It will lift 130,000 people out of the higher rate of income tax altogether.'
He added: 'A personal allowance of 11,000. A higher rate threshold of 43,000. 29 million people paying less tax. A downpayment for a country on the up.'
Mr Osborne had faced calls for the government to force companies to pay staff the Living Wage of 7.85 an hour (9.15 in London), rather than the adult national minimum wage of 6.50.
But he outmanoeuvred his political opponents with the shock creation of a new National Living Wage. National Living Wage.
Mr Osborne said the tax cuts announced today were a 'downpayment' on the way to meeting Tory promises for 2020
The Chancellor had been stung by criticism in recent weeks that his plan to cut tax credits paid to top up low wages would hit poor working families.
Instead, he announced that from April next year employers will have to pay everyone over 25 at least 7.20 an hour - rising 9 by 2020.
Mr Osborne ruled out reducing the top rate of tax for those earning more than 150,000 from 45p to 40p.
London Mayor Boris Johnson this week warned Britain's richest bosses should not get a tax cut until they pay their workers properly.
He said the idea of cutting the top rate of tax cannot be supported until business leaders pay their staff a living wage which means they do not have to rely on welfare to top up their income.
A study by Citizens UK this year showed that there were 5.2million low paid workers in supermarkets and shops the UK, receiving 11billion in state support through tax credits.
It is argued that if their firms paid them the Living Wage instead of the minimum wage it would save the taxpayer 6.7billion in benefits.
CitizensUK suggested that workers at five of the country's biggest retailers  Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Next  receive 1billion-a-year in taxpayer-funded subsidies topping up their low wages.

Non-dom tax status scrapped in crackdown on tax avoidance
Chancellor George Osborne announced plans to crack down on wealthy non-UK domiciled individuals who use their status to avoid paying full UK taxes.
Mr Osborne said permanent non-dom tax status will be scrapped and that anyone resident in the UK for more than 15 of the past 20 years will now pay full British taxes on all worldwide income and gains.
This means so-called non-doms will pay the same tax as everyone else in the UK.
Mr Osborne said permanent non-dom tax status will be scrapped and that anyone resident in the UK for more than 15 of the past 20 years will now pay full British taxes on all worldwide income and gains
Budget: Osborne to abolish nom-dom tax status by 2017
He said: 'Non-dom status was meant to be temporary, but it became permanent for some people. Not any longer.'
The Chancellor announced a package of measures tightening up who qualifies for non-dom status, which will come into effect from April 2017 and will raise 1.5 billion in additional tax over this parliament.
The Chancellor added it will no longer be possible for somebody who is born in the UK to parents who are UK domiciled, to claim non-domicile status if they leave but then return to live in the UK.
In a final measure, Mr Osborne said that non-doms with residential property in the UK will no longer be able to put it in an offshore company to avoid inheritance tax.
Non-dom tax status has existed in the UK since 1914, and has attracted wealthy foreigners, many of whom set up businesses in the UK.
The Chancellor also said he was boosting the budget of HM Revenue and Customs by 750million so it could intensify its chase of tax fraud, offshore trusts and the businesses in the hidden economy.
He said the move would triple the number of wealthy evaders the department pursued for prosecution, and forecast it would raise 7.2billion.

Career criminal: Homeless Robert Knowles, 68, pictured, has been convicted of 271 thefts
A career criminal who has been charged with theft every year since 1959 has been jailed again after stealing pair of trousers that were too small for him.
Robert Knowles, 68, has been convicted of 271 thefts - earning him the title of the nation's most prolific thief.
The homeless alcoholic  is now back behind bars after stealing an outfit worth 158 - including the pair of ill-fitting trousers - from a Marks and Spencer store in Plymouth.
When officers caught him he was wearing the clothes, which still had the security tags attached, and was moaning about the size of the trousers, a court heard.
Knowles was first sent to a correctional school in 1959 and has been back in court charged with theft every year since.
His record is so long prosecutors have lost track of his expansive rap sheet and it is believed he is now heading for nearly 350 offences.
Knowles was jailed for four months after pleading guilty to theft of the jacket and trousers from Marks and Spencer and theft of alcohol, socks and cheese worth 61 from Sainsbury's, both on May 12.
He also admitted breaching a conditional discharge imposed by Exeter magistrates only three days before for threatening criminal damage in which he threatened to smash a shop window.
Sentencing Knowles at Plymouth Crown Court, Judge Paul Darlow said his previous convictions 'smashed the previous record' for anyone else he had sentenced.
He told the defendant's barrister: 'I do not know what I should do. There can be no realistic prospect of community disposal.

	Buying motor, home and other insurance cover is set to become pricier from November after Chancellor George Osborne announced a tax hike from 6% to 9.5%.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

On the claims management industry, the Government said it wanted to build on the success of previous measures such as action to address fraudulent whiplash claims.
AA Insurance issued an angry response to news of the insurance premium tax hike to 9.5 per cent, saying: 'The contention that falling premiums somehow justifies the tax increase is outrageous.'
Managing director Janet Connor said: 'It means an additional 17.50 on top of the average quoted Shoparound premium, according to the AAs benchmark British Insurance Premium Index, and it comes precisely at a time when premiums are beginning to rise once again.
'The average Shoparound premium at the end of the first quarter of 2015 was 530, having fallen from a peak of 742 at the end of 2011, following a significant increase in the number whiplash injury claims and cash for crash fraud. They have not yet fallen back to the 493 which was a typical premium at the beginning of 2010.'
Ms Connor said the tax increase hadn't been thought through and would have unintended consequences, including greater upward pressure on premiums as a whole and people being tempted to attempt to drive without insurance cover.
Kevin Pratt, insurance expert at MoneySupermarket.com, said: 'For drivers and households across the country, it is important to note that the taxation you pay on home and car insurance premiums will rocket by almost 60 per cent from November, adding 35 to insurance bills for the average two car family.
Home cover: Government pointed out the cost of contents insurance had fallen 8 per cent since last year
'While we have all been benefitting from declining costs for car and home insurance premiums over the last few years, this tax increase may now sadly negate those benefits.'
Simon McCulloch, director of comparethemarket.com, said the major worry was that the insurance premium tax increase to 9.5 per cent would simply be passed on to consumers through higher premiums.
'There is a risk that through increasing insurance premiums, it may in fact discourage people from taking out insurance, or being underinsured.
'The regulators must safeguard against this happening, otherwise these policies, however well intentioned, will simply hit people's pockets to the detriment of all.'
Amanda Blanc, boss of AXAs UK Commercial Business, said: 'The cap on charges from claims management companies is a very welcome development in todays Budget.
'A clampdown was necessary to address a growing compensation culture epidemic. We recently found that more than a quarter of people have received a nuisance communication from a claims management company in the last 24 hours and this bombardment can often lead not only to the annoyance but also the anxiety of victims  not to mention higher premiums for everyone.
'More work needs to be done to address the societal issue of claims farming  and, for instance, we would support a ban on automated voicemail calls  but hopefully todays cap will reduce the volume of unsolicited messages.'

'Large amounts of camera equipment and lighting have been observed entering the property and we have tried turning a blind eye to the goings on at the property until now.'
Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said the dungeon would 'affect property prices' in the area, where five-bedroom homes sell for upwards of 1million.
He said: 'This place gets quite busy sometimes as it's used for filming as well as a dungeon - you often see men hanging around smoking and looking nervous.

Neighbours have complained to police about the 'whipping and screaming' sounds heard from the property
Mistress Evilyne, 31, (pictured), who appears to have been inspired by the hit 50 Shades of Grey franchise,insists she is registered with the HMRC and operates a legal business, which is 'all above board'
'You can hear whipping and screaming sometimes and people have complained to the police - as it's not just one dominatrix operating out of there, it's several.
'This is certainly not going to help property prices around here.'
Another, who also asked not to be named, said: 'Since we found out that the house was being used by a dominatrix we've been a bit more careful about taking the children past it as who knows what they might see.'
Staff at the nearby Knoll Orpington Lawn Tennis Club have also written to the police with concerns.
The garden of Mistress Evilyne's dungeon backs onto the tennis club, where 250 children enjoy lessons each week.
A tennis club spokesman said: 'We are aware of the dungeon. The garden of the house used by the dominatrix backs onto our tennis club.
'We host Crofton School for coaching and we are concerned the children might be exposed to something that they shouldn't see at their age.
'Is it legal? That's all we want to know.'

Punters have to agree to sign a waiver agreeing that 'Miss Evilyne will not be held responsible for any injury resulted from our risk-aware and consensual play session'.
From the outside, the property is a large, detached home on a quiet, leafy street but inside it is a thriving fetish establishment.
Mistress Evilyne said: 'People come to us for their fantasies, there are people who are into certain, specific things.

She said she was aware that some residents were concerned about her dungeon and said they were welcome to visit for a cup of tea and see the inside of the house for themselves.
She said: 'People are very uneasy about things they don't understand.
'Even me, before being a dominatrix, I was completely what you'd call vanilla.
'I'd never considered even going to a fetish party because I always thought it looked very dark and dingy. And actually, it's not at all like that.
'It's like hippies with leather.
'I think people are scared that it's sex, that it's sleazy, that it's something dangerous or whatever. That it's going to bring a bad name to the neighbourhood.'
She described those who complained as 'nay-sayers' who 'hide their identity behind their twitchy curtains as they grumble'.
She said: 'The police were indeed called to the property recently, and that was by my next door neighbour who didn't like the fact that a production company who had rented the property for the day chose to film a scene at the front door, with two actors dressed as policemen, being opened up to by two others who were acting out a couple having a domestic argument.
'After coming over and swearing at the crew, who told her that they were now done filming outside, and apologised profusely for any disturbance, she retreated and called the police saying that people were running around with guns outside the property.
'An armed response unit was called out, but when the police arrived and saw that there was nothing more than a couple of kiddy toy plastic truncheons, they left.'
One neighbour, who asked not to be named,  said Mistress Evilyne's dungeon would 'affect property prices' in the Orpington area of south east London (pictured), where five-bedroom homes sell for upwards of 1million
Staff at the Knoll Orpington Lawn Tennis Club (pictured), which backs onto the garden of Mistress Evilyne's dungeon, have written to police with concerns that children may be 'exposed to something they shouldn't'
She also struck out against the tennis club for claiming children may be able to see lewd goings-on in her home.
She said: 'They will be hard pressed to see anything happening. There are a fence, trees, and a long garden between the club and here.
'We hear coaches screaming at children all day long from the house.'
Mistress Evilyne became a dominatrix two years ago and describes herself online as an 'upper class English rose that you have dreamt of but never believed could exist'.
On her website, she says of herself: 'A graceful and well-spoken lady, of youthful and chaste looks, she hides beneath this demeanour a most cunning and mischievous wickedness.
'This FemDom practitioner is an artist and takes much delight in the spontaneous and creative approach to BDSM.
'Whether you be submissive or masochist, Mistress Evilyne will put to use her superior understanding of the male psyche to dig into your deepest desires and unearth your fetishist core.
'This stylish and talented Mistress will artfully push you to your limits, whether it be in servitude, humiliation, endurance or pleasure.'
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We haven't made any arrests but there has been a call to the location in the last week. That was a noise complaint about filming that was going on.'
He added officers had not found any evidence of illegal activity at the address.

	Former midfielder Terry Bradbury, 74, and his wife, Eleanor, known as Ann, from Buxton, Derbyshire, pictured together, held the only winning ticket in Saturday night's  draw.

'I was getting 20 for playing football but a tradesman was only getting 8 to 10, so it's all relative,' he added.
He said Jimmy Greaves was 'the greatest goal machine I ever saw' but 'ruthless' Dave Mackay was the hardest player he came up against.
'There wasn't the other distractions there are now,' he said. 'The crowds are always big. There was this banter between the crowds because they weren't segregated.
Mr Bradbury, pictured left in his Chelsea strip and right in 1966, said he played in the golden age of football
'People went to watch the football and enjoy the atmosphere.'
Asked about modern players, he said: 'Good luck to them. You can't blame the sportsmen. If someone offered you another 1,000 a week you would go.'
Mr Bradbury said: 'I had a good time at Chelsea, enjoyed every minute - all through my playing career. This is just the icing on the cake for Ann and I.'
He said he does not watch live football any more because 'I'd rather be playing'.
Mr Bradbury said one of his most cherished memories was walking out at Wembley in front of 90,000 people as a 15-year-old schoolboy.
The Bradburys, who have five sons and nine grandchildren together, ran a pub in Tideswell, Derbyshire, together for more than 13 years before retiring. They said they plan to buy a villa in Spain
'I'd like to be 15 walking out again,' he said.
And he said he thought Jose Mourinho 'has done a fantastic job' as Chelsea manager.
Mr and Mrs Bradbury, who have five sons and nine grandchildren together, ran a pub in Tideswell, Derbyshire, together for more than 13 years before retiring.
Mrs Bradbury said they were drinking tea when they found out they had won and celebrated with a second cup. And the first thing her husband did was to take their son's dog, Alfie, out for a walk.
Professional career: Midfielder Mr Bradbury, pictured in 1966, scored one goal during his five years at Chelsea before moving to Southend United for 6,000 after falling out with the manager
The couple said they play Lotto every week and normally play with the same numbers, but decided to change to a Lucky Dip for Saturday's draw.
Mr Bradbury added: 'We just felt like a change so threw two Lucky Dip lines on  and we are so glad we did. We will definitely be continuing to play Lotto  and will probably stick with Lucky Dips too!'
Mr Bradbury said he did not know what he was going to spend his cash on first but that  they are looking forward to spending their winnings on their family - and on a holiday villa in Spain.
Mrs Bradbury said: 'Looking after our sons and our nine grandchildren is something which is a priority for both of us.
'It is wonderful to think that none of our children will have a mortgage or any stress for the rest of their lives.
'This win provides our family with security and this is what pleases Terry and myself more than anything.'

	Madeleine McCann's parents Gerry and Kate McCann hit back at Yorkshire Ripper
      </title>

        <Description>
	Peter Sutcliffe, pictured,  claims 'there's something not quite right' about the case. The killer has several outlandish theories about Madeleine McCann's disappearance from Portugal in 2007.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
The Sun did not print the full allegations made by Sutcliffe for legal reasons. 
Sutcliffe even sent Valentines cards to some women expressing his love, while another he said he felt protective towards her.
The murderer, who received a life sentence in 1981 and was told he would serve a minimum of 30 years informed one of his female admirers that he regularly goes to sleep with a teddy bear.
He asked another whether she had a regular boyfriend.In one of the notes, he claims: 'I would like to visit the seaside and have fish and chips and mushy peas. I've done more than my original sentence after all.'
Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor hospital in Berkshire, pictured, since 1984, three years after his conviction
Sutcliffe is currently writing to a range of female admirers, some of whom send him gifts to his hospital
Chillingly, he continues: 'Don't worry, I'm very easy to talk to and I will put you at ease.. I'm very fond of you. I guess you know that by now.'
As well as writing to his admirers, he gets to speak to some of them regularly on the phone. In return they send him various gifts, from DVDs, CDs to even a book by Jeremy Clarkson.
Hospital authorities are believed to be considering moving Sutcliffe from his current high security unit to the Priory centre with Broadmoor, set within the Berkshire woodland.
Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial.
Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail.
Police believe Sutcliffe, pictured, murdered more than the 13 women he was convicted of
He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours.
It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital's shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions.
It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah's Witness and was even given a baptism.
In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported.
A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe  the first for 20 years  supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard.
He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes.
The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack.
The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately.
Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree.
Former lorry driver Sutcliffe has received a book written by Jeremy Clarkson, pictured, by a female admirer. The former Top Gear host caused controversy when he said that truck drivers murdered prostitutes
The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly.
He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left
It costs taxpayers more than 300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell.
Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected.
In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released.
Sutcliffe was convicted of murdering 13 women, 12 of whom are pictured here, but he may have killed more

	Christopher Kellie, 21, from Mount Vernon, Glasgow, ventured down to his local fast food joint in quest of a part-time job and he left with a modelling contract.

Speaking to the Daily Record about how he was scouted after handing in his CV to McDonald's, he said: 'I had just got back in her car when this crazy woman threw herself in front of it and started shouting at her to stop. I rolled down the window and she asked if I would like to be a model.
'I thought she was joking until she handed me her card.At the time, I didnt think about what a big deal it was - I was a typical teenager.'
Christopher, who was 16 at the time, was scouted by the Colours Agency after the company's founder spotted him in the restaurant when she was dining with her family there
Christopher, who has thousands of Instagram followers, is now the face of Harvey Nichols, JD Sports and has stripped to his boxers for underwear brand, D. Hedral, pictured, which is a brand Thom Evans has also worked for
It did, however, turn out to be a big deal. Alison Bruce, co-owner of Colours Agency, quickly helped Christopher become one of Scotland's most sought-after models.
Speaking to FEMAIL about spotting his potential, she said: I was in McDonald's with my husband and two kids and I spotted this fresh-faced, gorgeous boy walking up to the counter.
'I knew immediately that he had something very special. I had to follow him into the car park and literally throw myself in front of his poor mothers car! They both thought I was a crazy woman.
'It just happens like that sometimes. You just see a face and know they have incredible potential.'
She says people are going 'crazy' for him because he has a brilliant personality, as well as model good looks.
'Everyone that books him absolutely adores him. The skys the limit for this boy. He just needs to continue working hard and looking after himself, and hell be sure to be a huge international success,' she added.

Christopher, who has just been signed to Boss Model Management in Manchester, originally left school to study for a HNC in personal training but models full-time - something he admits he never thought was possible.
The budding posterboy hopes to travel to Los Angeles and New York and model for the likes of Versace, Tom Ford and Hugo Boss. 
Christopher added: 'Fate took me to McDonalds that day and I havent looked back. Its a good job because I never heard back from McDonalds.'

	Workers earning £150k-plus face cut to pension annual allowance
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/pensions/article-3153336/Workers-earning-150k-plus-face-cut-pension-annual-allowance.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490

	The size of the annual allowance will be gradually reduced from £40k to £10k for those making £150k a year or more, it was announced in today's Budget.

What do pension tax relief changes mean for you?
The general perception of reductions to lifetime and annual allowances is that only the wealthiest savers are hit.
But opponents say reducing tax incentives to save for old age doesn't only affect higher earners and is a bad idea in principle, because it effectively sets a limit on people's ambition to get a decent pension.
Annual bill: George Osborne's Treasury currently pays out around 34.8bn a year in pension tax relief - including rebates to employers as well as workers.
To many, 40,000 might seem a very high sum to put in a pension in just one year, but people do sometimes come into large sums suddenly - from inheritances, redundancy payouts or property sales, for example.
Workers who feel they underfunded their pensions because they couldn't afford the higher contributions in earlier life might well be keen to make up shortfalls if they become wealthier in later life.
Wage inflation means that if the lifetime allowance keeps being either frozen or cut, more middle-level earners will hit it too as time goes on. But if too many people are ensnared, future Governments will come under pressure to increase the allowance again.
The lifetime allowance also sounds like a lot of money - and it is - but see the box below for an example of how someone who starts out earning 30,000 could eventually run up against the 1.25million limit.
The current lifetime allowance system also benefits final salary scheme members more than defined contribution pension investors.
A pension pot of 1.25million will produce a very comfortable annual sum of around 62,500 if you are in a generous final salary scheme, which provides a guaranteed income for life.
It will buy just over 30,000 of guaranteed income from an annuity if you are in a far more stingy 'defined contribution' pension, which workers and employers put money into to build up a retirement pot.
Read more here about how annual and lifetime allowances work and what happens if you breach them.
Osborne discusses inheritance tax in budget
WHY LIFETIME ALLOWANCE IS NOT JUST A HEADACHE FOR  RICH
Reductions in the lifetime allowance over the years have meant it is now a consideration of many more workers than it once was.
For example, if someone starts their career earning 30,000 and is lucky enough to enjoy promotions and pay rises equivalent to 5 per cent a year on average over their career, they would be earning around 165,000 after 35 years of work.
If they were to contribute the recommended 15 per cent of their salary to a defined contribution pension throughout their career, and their fund grew at 7 per cent after fees, they would hit the current 1.25million lifetime allowance in their 34th year of work. Under the 1million limit, they would hit it in their 32nd year of work.
The allowance is hit sooner if they contribute more than 15 per cent, as many older workers do, or if their pay rises faster than 5 per cent a year or if their fund achieves better than 7 per cent growth.
That 165,000 salary and 1million pension pot sound like a lot of money, so many will think this is not their problem.
But it is vital to remember that you need to think of this not in terms of today's money but in terms of what the sums will be worth in thirty-odd years time after inflation has eaten into their purchasing power. If you earned a 30,000 salary today and rose in line with inflation of 3 per cent a year, in 34 years time you would earn 83,000.Ed Monk
What does the pension industry say?
David Smith, financial planning director at Tilney Bestinvest, said the reduction in pensions tax relief could lead to higher earners paying tax at an effective rate of 67.5 per cent.
'The Institute for Fiscal Studies has identified that there are currently circa 300,000 individuals in the UK who receive taxable incomes that exceed 150,000 per annum, so this proposed change will only affect a relatively small proportion of the working population.
'These individuals are already subject to income tax at 45 per cent on earnings that exceed 150,000 and, if you take into account National Insurance contributions of 2 per cent, they already only effectively receive 53p of every pound earned above 150,000.'
Jason Whyte, director in insurance at EY,said: 'As expected, the Chancellor made changes to IHT [inheritance tax] and pensions tax relief that amount to "save less now, inherit more later".
Number crunching: How annual allowance will be reduced if you earn 150,000 a year or more (Source: Retirement Advantage)
'Todays high earners wont be able to save as much on a tax-free basis, but will be able to inherit the ancestral home and the remains of their parents pensions intact.
'People might spend money that would have gone into their pensions on subsidising retired parents to preserve their pension pots. Theres also a big question about whether these changes, which bring tax revenue forward, will create a revenue hole for a later government.'
Ian Naismith, pensions expert at Scottish Widows, said: 'We recognise that the Government needs to make savings and has identified pensions tax relief as one area where this is possible.
'However, constantly tinkering with allowances is problematic at a time when we need people in all income groups to be confident in the pensions system as automatic enrolment is rolled out.
'There is a danger that todays announcement suggests even to those not directly affected by the changes that you wont be able to rely on getting what you expected from your pension.'
Higher earners: Doctors and headteachers are among those who could be affected by changes to the pension annual allowance for the better paid
Paul Waters, partner at Hymans Robertson, said: 'Our view is that the current model of tax relief is distorted, with too much of the value flowing to higher earners.
'We do need a model thats more equitable for all UK pension savers, but it needs to give everyone an incentive to save. A flat-rate tax relief on pension saving, perhaps at the 33 per cent level suggested by Steve Webb, the former Pensions Minister, would do that.'
'This would impose a natural limit for higher-rate tax payers. Lifetime allowance limits could then be scrapped, ending the inequitable impact on defined contribution versus defined benefit [final salary] pension savers.'

	Harry Harling fell to his death from Dubai balcony after drunken row with friend

	Harry Harling, 15, originally from Woking, Surrey, had moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with his family in 2009.

The police investigation in Dubai originally treated the death in March 2012 as suicide but his parents Nicolus and Beverley Harling said they were still no closer to understanding what had happened that night.
They told the hearing Harry had been pre-drinking at his parents' house in the marina area of Dubai with three other male friends, before they headed out to another friend's party in Motor City.
His mother told the hearing that she knew he was drinking that night and he was allowed to drink at home or at his friends' houses.
A coroner was told the sports-mad teenager had played football, rugby, enjoyed mixed martial arts including kung-fu and was academically bright and popular at school
The police investigation in Dubai originally treated the death in March 2012 as suicide but his parents Nicolus and Beverley Harling (pictured today) said they were still no closer to understanding what had happened
'We knew he liked his lager or ciders,' she said.
In the strict Islamic country where drinking in public is forbidden and there is limited access to alcohol, teenagers often gather in apartments with their own supply of drink.
She said she was expecting him to head home in a taxi after the party in a group with other friends, as was usual when Harry went out, as the pair were going to a function together the following day, but when he rang her at 9pm to ask if he could sleep over, she agreed.
However, the following morning there was no sign of Harry and she couldn't get hold of him on his phone as she was getting ready to head to the Arabian Ranches for a barbecue.
Mrs Harling said: 'I was loading all the stuff up (for the party) and I was cross.
'I thought he was hiding, that he's waiting for me to go and then he'll slip in.'
The hearing was told that while at her friend's barbecue, she had a call from the police asking her to visit a local station but she left it an hour as she thought a spell in the cells would 'frighten' her son out of whatever trouble her son had got into.
But after she arrived at the station, after some time talking to officers and answering questions, one revealed the horrific news, saying simply: 'Harry's dead.'
The hearing was told Harry had been pre-drinking at his parents' house in the marina area of Dubai with three other male friends, before they headed out to another friend's party in Motor City (pictured)
'It just didn't feel real,' she told Woking Coroners' Court today.
'I just didn't believe them.'
Harry's body was found in the complex at 9.30am by a passing security guard, the inquest heard.
The New Bridge Hills complex where the party was held was made up of three adjoining buildings, with other housing developments close by.
Tharkabthovar Ram Ram said he had found the youngster.
The guard, who had worked at the complex for around five months, noticed an open window on the 11th floor of the building, which had been 'ripped out' onto its hinges, leaving a large enough gap for a person to fit through.
Post mortem examinations carried out in both the UAE and UK showed he had died from multiple injuries, including a fractured spinal cord, consistent with a fall from a great height.
British pathologist Dr Robert Chapman could find no evidence Harry had been assaulted prior to the fall, but a forensic scientist said she could not rule it out entirely.
Toxicology tests found he had been drinking, and was around twice the UK drive driving limit with 163mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. No traces of any drugs were found in his system.
Police officer Abdullah Al Mazmi inspected the scene and found a small bloodstain on the wall inside the building and fingerprints on the window sill which he thought showed Harry had been 'looking down before jumping.'
Sixteen-year-old Harry Francis, who had hosted the teenage party at his mother's apartment in New Bridge Hills, said there had been a disagreement between Harry and another friend, Harry Radcliff over a prank involving a friend's tee-shirt.
After things calmed down, he said: 'I saw Harry sitting by himself by the elevator.
'He was teary-eyed. I asked him if he needed money for a taxi and he told me to f*** off.
'That was the last time I saw him.'
He added that the windows in the corridors were never locked and it would be possible to 'clamber out' if it was open.
Close friend Thomas Harding cleared up the mystery of Harry's final tweet posted the night of his death.
Before his death the Year 11 pupil tweeted 'F*** the system,' raising suspicions that he had been suicidal.
However, Mr Harding, who met Harry through the Dubai Exiles rugby team, said the tweet had been a reference to lyrics in a song the friends had been listening to in a taxi to the party.
'I think in the days after Harry died, the story was in the press in England,' he said.
'They picked up one of Harry's tweets. It said: 'F*** the system #Hardling..' 'That was not what it seemed. I think it was lyrics from a song.'I'm pretty sure he did that (tweet) in the taxi. I think it was a song that was playing.'
He added that the hashtag 'Hardling' was an in-joke combining both Harry and his surnames.
The family moved to the UAE when Harry was 13, and he went to 9,500-a-year Jumeirah College, and lived in Dubai Marina (pictured)
Other partygoers said they had also seen Harry being 'emotional' and 'upset' but that this was no more than usual for when he had drunk too much.
Friend Amelia Labouchere said Harry was usually the 'life of the party' and she'd been left 'devastated' by his death.
'Harry and I used to talk all the time,' she said.
'He was loveable, fun, confident and kind. He was a bit of a ladies' man but was so kind.'
The sporty teenager was born at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford, Surrey, before his family moved to Switzerland, where he attended a local school near Montreux, learning the language to become bilingual.
The family moved to the UAE when he was 13, and he went to 9,500-a-year Jumeirah College, where he played sports and studied hard, sitting his French GCSE several years early.
Mrs Harling added: 'He settled very well. He loved Dubai.
'For us, it's what happened and obviously it's the different judicial system, but we were very disappointed that people weren't questioned.
'It just seems so unjust for a lovely, very caring young boy with great potential.
'He just deserved better, even in his death. A better investigation in his death.
'I know he would want us to know what happened. I guess that's just how it works when you move abroad.
'We've tried all avenues to find out more and we never will find out.'
Richard Travers, coroner for Surrey, said there was a lamentable lack of evidence in the case, meaning the family would never truly know what had happened.
'The sad fact of the matter is that the general paucity of evidence means that we will never know how Harry fell from the building, though fall he did,' he said.
'Despite strenuous efforts on the parts of all concerned, it's just not proved to be possible.
'I conclude that the cause of Harry's death was multiple injuries and I record an open conclusion.
'I acknowledge that Harry touched the lives of so many in his all too short life.'

The scheme under challenge dates back to the announcement of the drawdown of UK forces from Afghanistan in 2012.
Dismissed: Lord Justice Burnett, pictured, and Mr. Justice Irwin ruled there was no discrimination
It was introduced to help interpreters and other local staff deemed to be in 'dangerous and challenging roles' who had been in post on December 19 2012 and served more than 12 months.
With certain exceptions, staff whose employment ended before that date, either voluntarily or for disciplinary reasons, were not eligible.
Their lawyers contended they were being treated differently to Iraqi interpreters, who were all given assistance when their lives became endangered through assisting the British in the Iraq war.
Rosa Curling, the lawyer at solicitors Leigh Day representing the Afghan men, said they would seek to appeal.
Ms Curling said: 'The court clearly recognised that the British forces operating in Afghanistan could not have functioned without the assistance of locally employed staff, including men like our clients, former interpreters who exposed themselves to considerable personal risk.
'The Taliban have exacted revenge against these locally employed staff, who have been subject to intimidation, some have been attacked and killed.
'Yet despite this, a scheme equitable to the Iraqi scheme is not available to those Afghans to who we owe a great debt of honour.
'We are disappointed by the decision and the failure to recognise this debt and we will be seeking to appeal the decision.'

	War veteran with PTSD killed himself after '6 Army friends also ended their lives'

	Father-of-two Dylan Jones, 37, of Llansawel, Carmarthenshire, was due to marry fiancée Shan Thomas but killed himself a month before the wedding after apparently suffering post-traumatic stress.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>488 shares
'You are broken then, and there's no one there to fix the pieces.'
Mr Jones then spent two years working as a private bodyguard in Afghanistan after leaving the Army before starting work in October last year at his fiance's pub The Pink Geranium Hotel in Pontardawe, south Wales.
She said he was 'loved by the locals' but behind his happy exterior was a tormented soul.
She said: 'When I met him I noticed his sleeping patterns were off and his memory was terrible.
'He was very distant some days and would be thinking, thinking, thinking.
Miss Thomas, 44, said more help was needed for veterans battling to cope with the horrors they have witnessed in war zones such as Afghanistan. She said her partner suffered from post-traumatic stress
Mr Jones joined the Royal Fusiliers aged 16 and served three tours in Helmand Province before leaving the Armed Forces in 2012 but struggled to cope 'with the outside world', according to his long-term partner
'He had flashbacks of the war and would wake up screaming and sweating.
'He had started to open up to me about the war. But you wouldn't think that Dylan suffered with PTSD because he just looked like a normal person.
'I didn't know the extent of the PTSD - it's a silent killer.'
The happy couple returned from a Mediterranean cruise a fortnight before Mr Jones took his own life - and were planning another cruise following their wedding in August.
She said: 'He said he felt the happiest he had ever been.
'I thought he was getting better because he started to open up to me about stories from out there. I thought he was coping with it.'
Mr Jones leaves behind his eight-year-old twin son and daughter Malachai and Faith, his mother Gloria and sister Amanda.
TAKING THE WAR HOME WITH THEM: SOLDIERS, SUICIDE AND PTSD
More than 200,000 British Service personnel were deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan.
Of these troops, it was predicted 20.1 per cent would develop symptoms of PTSD or a common mental health disorder while 4 per cent would develop PTSD, according to a report by the Kings Centre for Military Health Research.
While PTSD remains a problem for veterans, the rate of those reporting experiencing symptoms is very similar to the general population, according to veterans' mental health charity Combat Stress.
The charity said symptoms of trauma can include feeling isolated; angry or aggressive behaviour; and suicidal thoughts.
Some may feel numb or empty while others might experience work-related or relationship problems. Nightmares, flashback and insomnia can also present as symptoms.
In 2013, BBC Panorama reported that more British soldiers and veterans took their own lives in 2012 than died fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan over the same period.
The programme learned that 21 serving soldiers killed themselves, along with 29 veterans.
In contrast, the death toll in Afghanistan was 44, with 40 dying in action.
Combat Stress said suicide remains a 'rare occurrence' in both UK Regulars and Veterans - and that the rate is not significantly different to the rate among the general UK population.
The charityis currently supporting more than 970 Veterans who served in Afghanistan.
Veterans, Service personnel and their families can call the Combat Stress 24-hour Helpline on 0800 138 1619 or visit www.combatstress.org.uk for more information.

	Tiffany and Taliah Sanderson, aged 19, were ordered by magistrates in Stockport not to 'generate any music or loud noise including shouting or screaming' between 8pm and 8am.

The Sanderson sisters have since moved from the family home to a flat on Stockport Road, Marple.
But it has now emerged that they have been causing problems there, too.
Denise Edwards, who works in a nearby newsagents, said: 'They've been here since about April. I believe they're moving out in three weeks because somebody has already put a complaint in.
'Their language is atrocious and the music is very loud. Luckily I go to sleep early but if I heard that music they would know about it.
'The neighbour on the other side says she can't get to sleep. There's usually those two, a Scottish girl and a couple of lads. There are always comings and goings, but always in the night. You don't hear from them in the daytime.'
Another nearby resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I've heard about parties. They're becoming quite well known around here and they haven't been here long.'
It comes after one disgruntled former neighbour, who did not want to be named, claimed the twins were more likely to appear on Big Brother than be properly punished.
They said: 'I have a three-year-old and seven-year-old and these twin sisters have used bad language at all hours of the day and night. I obviously don't want my kids hearing it.
Posing for the camera: The twins are both former beauty students who have since moved from the family home to a flat on Stockport Road, Marple. Tiffany is pictured left and Taliah right
Ongoing problem: The twins, Tiffany is pictured second right and Taliah far left on a night out with friends, terrorised neighbours with loud music and rowdy behaviour for seven years
The family home where 19-year-old twins Tiffany and Taliah Sanderson were said to have been living with their mother. They are believed to have moved to a flat on Stockport Road, Marple, in April
'They were also coming in at all hours of the night. The police have been called out on numerous occasions and their records will show that the girls have been going in and out late at night for many years. Now that the house is up for sale, I hope that it will come to an end.
'Unfortunately, in the crazy world we live in now, these girls will probably end up on Big Brother rather than getting the punishment they deserve.'
Other residents said they were hopeful the saga was now at an end having been brought to court.
Under their ASBOs, the Sanderson twins were instructed by the court to adhere to a number of other strict conditions.
They must not use abusive, insulting, offensive, threatening or intimidating language to neighbours or their visitors.
The pair must also not behave in a way that causes harassment, alarm or distress to anyone they do not live with.
It is thought the sisters will fight the allegations after they were backed by other neighbours.
Old antics: It has now emerged the twins have been causing problems at their new flat, too. One of their new neighbours suggested the pair may be moving out in the next three weeks. Tiffany is pictured left and right
The mother of Taliah and Tiffany Sanderson (pictured) said the allegations against her daughter were false
No problems: Another neighbour Roger Wilkson, 51, a company director, said: 'Their garden backs on to ours and weve never heard any loud noises or parties.' The girls are pictured with friends
Today there was no answer at the models' apartment in Marple. But at the family home their mother, who refused to be named, said: 'They dont live here anymore. They wont want to say anything.
'Its all false allegations. Thats all I want to say. We know who has complained.'
Another neighbour Roger Wilkson, 51, a company director, said: 'Their garden backs on to ours and weve never heard any loud noises or parties.
'I dont know where the stuff about loud music comes from. It seems there is a serial complainer who has been complaining about them.
I have a three-year-old and seven-year-old and these twin sisters have used bad language at all hours of the day and night
An unnamed neighbour
'The family had lived here for about eight years and as far as Im concerned there hasnt been a problem. We have had complaints about our dogs barking and building a chimney and they are completely unfounded too.'
Another neighbour Claire Jackson said: 'The family have never really bothered us. Ive heard a bit of noise every now and again but never complained because its never been a big thing.
'I have three young children and theyve never been woken up. The girls seem alright. We smile at them and say hello to their mother. Theyre typical teens.
'Ive heard arguments every now and again and a bit of bad language but nothing out of the ordinary that would make me complain.'
The neighbour who is thought to have complained about the girls refused to give his name but said: 'Its an ongoing court case, I will comment when its finished. That will be in August. I dont want to comment while its ongoing.
'This is a nice quiet area. Apparently its the quietest in the Greater Manchester police area. You wouldnt expect whats happened, would you? We have young kids here. Would anybody want that?'
Inspector Jim Lockett, from Stockport east area neighbourhood police, said his officers had been called to the address in the early hours for incidents often involving loud music.
Modelling career: The Sanderson sisters (pictured is Taliah) are both former Stockport College beauty and make up media students and are on the books of Boss Model Management in Manchester
Unhappy: Residents on Windlehurst Road, High Lane (pictured), who lived close to the twins at their family home, have repeatedly complained about the sisters' rowdy behaviour to the police
He said: 'There is some kind of neighbour dispute between twin sisters at one address and a person at another.
'Staff have been made aware that there have been incidents at the location and we may be called there again.
'If we are and there is an anti-social behaviour order in place we would be looking at making arrests.'
The Sanderson sisters are both former Stockport College beauty and make up media students and are on the books of Boss Model Management in Manchester.
Both have online portfolios with a string of glamorous shots.
A council spokesman said: 'After a number of complaints of anti-social behaviour, we took legal action against Tiffany and Taliah Sanderson.
'This interim ASBO bans them from harassing people, including using insulting, offensive or threatening language.
'We are very pleased it has been awarded. Their victims have suffered from their actions and we want to see that end.'

William, Kate, George and Charlotte were walking the short distance to Sandringham House for a christening tea hosted by the Queen.
There, the family are believed to have enjoyed sandwiches and slices of christening cake - the latter a tier from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding confection.
Although the Queen is George's great-grandmother, he is following in his father's footsteps by calling her Granny.

That much was made famously clear when, during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, William and Harry were heard shouting 'Go Granny!' during the famous parachute stunt.
In an interview to mark the Diamond Jubilee, Harry told journalists: 'To me, she's just Granny' and, during the closing concert for the Invictus Games last year, introduced a message from the monarch by saying: 'Here's  Granny'.
While the name used for the Duchess of Cornwall is unknown, George is thought to refer to his other granny Carole Middleton as 'Grandma'.

	As Chancellor, writing the Budget speech is the biggest parts of George Osborne's job but he was mocked over a photo showing him writing in a perfect Times New Roman font.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
REVEALED: GEORGE'S SECRET TWITTER WAR WITH THE LIB DEMS
Just four months ago, George Osborne and his Lib Dem number two Danny Alexander stood together in Downing Street ahead of their last Coalition budget.
But the relationship between the Chancellor and his former allies appears to have dramatically soured after it emerged he had officially blocked the Lib Dems on his official Twitter account.
Mr Osbornes decision, which means the Lib Dems cannot view any of his Twitter messages, was ridiculed this morning.
One party source said: You wouldve thought he had much greater things to worry about on Budget day than the Lib Dem press office.
He must have seen something from us he didnt like and decided to block us. Its rather daft. It gives you a bit of an insight into his state of mind.
The picture was taken at his desk in Number 11 Downing Street, with his official red leather folder to his left and the red Budget book to his right.
While Mr Osborne hoped to communicated the message behind his Budget measures, some on Twitter were more interested in what he was doing with his pen.
Andrew Wilson asked: 'Why is Osborne holding a pen in this photo? Is that supposed to be his handwriting? Or is he colouring in the O's?'
Benjamin Partridge wrote: 'George Osborne can write Times New Roman with a pen!'
Dave W added: 'That awkward moment when you're George Osborne and your pen is an inkjet printer.'
Freed from the shackles of coalition with the Lib Dems, Mr Osborne will use his Commons statement to set out the first all-Tory Budget since 1996.
He will give more detail of his plan to tackle the 75billion deficit and have the government raising more than it spends by 2018-19.
The Conservatives are committed to cutting 12billion from the welfare budget, with tax credits and housing benefit suffering the biggest cuts.
However, the Treasury has raked in more than expected in taxes in the last year creating 'wiggle room' for Mr Osborne to implement the benefit cuts over the next three years instead of two.
Analysts have suggested the Treasury could receive an additional 700 million this year - twice official expectations - thanks to new pension freedoms.

	Alton Towers crash survivor Joe Pugh, 18, was sitting in the front row of The Smiler ride with 17-year-old Leah Washington when their carriage crashed into an empty one in front on June 2.

'When we got to the top of the incline, we got stuck for 20 minutes, and I said to Leah, "this shouldn't be happening".'
As the carriage was released and began to hurtle along at 20mph, it smashed into the other car which had become stuck on the track.
Mr Pugh said he had shut his eyes when the carriage was making its descent, and only realised what had happened when he opened them again after the crash.
Joe Pugh describes the horrific Alton Towers crash
Mr Pugh's finger was severed in the impact of the crash, and both of his knee caps were shattered
Mr Pugh said he had shut his eyes when the carriage was making its descent, and only realised what had happened when he opened them again after the crash
He said he did not realise the extent of Miss Washington's injuries, as the carriage was so full of blood, but saw he had badly broken one of his finger, while another had been severed in the impact.
'All the injuries looked similar, our knees were bleeding,' he said. 'All I could see was [my] finger and I could see bone hanging out of it, and [my other] finger hanging off.
'I could have pulled it off, it was that severe.'
Mr Pugh and his fellow ride goers then had to endure a four-and-a-half hour wait to be freed from the ride, such was the complicated and dangerous nature of the rescue mission.
'I was screaming because I was in pain, but it was more like a mental pain, rather than physical, and I remember screaming and shouting at people to just stop taking pictures.'
He said medics were bringing painkillers and antibiotics to those trapped in the carriage, but he had refused.
'I said no,' said Mr Pugh, who is studying textile design at Huddersfield University. 'I'm petrified of needles. I had two paracetamol when I got into the ambulance but that was it.'
The couple were on their first date when they visited the theme park in Staffordshire were sitting at the front of the carriage, which can hold 16 people
Mr Pugh (right) and Miss Washington (left) were trapped on the Smiler ride when the horrific accident happened. They were trapped on the ride for hours before emergency service workers could free them
When they were finally pulled free of the ride, Miss Washington was rushed to hospital by air ambulance, while Mr Pugh was taken by road.
Miss Balch's boyfriend Daniel Thorpe, 27, a hotel manager from Buxton in Derbyshire was treated for a collapsed lung and fractured leg, while Chandaben Chauhan, 49, of Wednesbury, West Midlands, also suffered injuries.
Both of Mr Pugh's knees were smashed, and he now faces months of physiotherapy. He broke one of his fingers in three places, while the severed digit was re-attached, but he will never be able to use it again.
He said: 'At first when I couldnt feel my legs I did think, "Am I paralysed?" But when they did the checks and I could feel my toes I knew that I wouldnt be. After the X rays, I had two shard kneecaps, ligaments damaged on the back of both of my legs, and my fingers - theres a compound fracture on this one, I broke it in three places, and this finger has just snapped off...'
Earlier this week, Mr Pugh (left) posted a photograph of he and Miss Washington (right) enjoying a meal out at a restaurant together - their first date since the horrific accident at Alton Towers
Mr Pugh said during the rescue effort, medics were bringing painkillers and antibiotics to those trapped in the carriage, but he had refused them

He revealed he had also been told that he would struggle to walk up stairs for the rest of his life, and with making long journeys, and adaptations have had to be made to his family home to help him get around.
But he said he was determined not to use the wheelchair he has been given by doctors.
'I hate using a wheelchair,' he said. 'I don't want people to look at me and think "oh".
'If I'm shopping I have walked for half an hour but then I need to have painkillers. If people give me that look that says they feel sorry for me, I'd rather they just come up and say "how are you?"
Leah Washington, 17, (pictured centre) from Barnsley in South Yorkshire, shared this picture of herself smiling alongside friends and family just weeks after her leg was amputated following the June 2 crash
'My finger will never work again, they have only done it for cosmetic reasons.'
He said he was determined to return to his university course in September and did not want to take a year out because he had made so many friends.
Mr Pugh and Miss Washington had started seeing each other in April, before making the trip to Alton Towers on their first official date.
Earlier this week he posted a photograph of the pair enjoying a meal out together, their first date since the horrific accident.
Vicky Balch, 20 (right), who lost her leg in the Alton Towers crash, is pictured alongside Major Kate Philp, 35, who also had a limb amputated
Mr Pugh said he did not want to talk about Miss Washington's recovery out of respect for her privacy, but said: 'She's doing really well.'
Miss Washington is still being treated in hospital as she recovers from the amputation.
Later, in an interview with ITV news, Mr Pugh added: 'Shes still the same person and its like if you lost a friend because you changed your hair colour, thats how I thought of it, and if you lose somebody just because theyve lost a limb then youre not worth having.
'When I went down the other day for an outpatient appointment and we went out for a meal and it felt like nothing had changed, but obviously then she has to get in a wheelchair and go back to hospital and I have to get on my crutches to go to the toilet or whatever, and it brings it back to you that something has happened.'
Mr Pugh told This Morning that he had been a huge fan of The Smiler ride, but said the experience had put him off going on rollercoasters for life.
'I'm not going on a rollercoaster again. Definitely not. Maybe in ten or 15 years I might change my mind, but at this moment definitely not.'
He said he did not feel any anger towards Alton Towers, but admitted this may change when the official report into the accident is released.
'Since the accident they [Alton Towers] have been unreal, you couldn't thank them enough for how they have been.
'Obviously when the health and saftey checks get released and stuff and we find out what actually happened then I might feel a different emotion, but until then I dont want to feel angry or point the blame at anybody.'
Last week Miss Balch shared the first picture of herself since undergoing surgery to remove her leg.
She was pictured sitting alongside Major Kate Philp, an Afghanistan veteran who also had her leg amputated below the knee after being hit by a roadside bomb in 2008.
Posting the image on her Twitter page, Miss Balch wrote: 'Today I was inspired by a very amazing woman Major Kate Philp and I hope one day I can do the same for somebody else.'
The picture is believed to have been taken at the Royal Stoke University Hospital, where Miss Balch is said to be recovering.
Major Philp was the only woman to take part in the Walking With The Wounded trek to the South Pole alongside Prince Harry two years ago.

	Lauren Holsten's fury as photography firm airbrushes daughter's birthmark

	Lauren Holsten, 20, had taken her 18-month-old daughter Lexi to have her photo taken wearing vintage clothing after spotting a stand at her local shopping centre in Sittingbourne, Kent.

The photography company has blamed Ms Holsten - saying she should have pointed out the birthmark and asked for it not to be removed from the photo.
But they admitted they have now changed their policy and will check with all parents what they want to do about any natural marks on their children.
The company meanwhile has been told it can no longer operate from the shopping centre in Sittingbourne, Kent.
Ms Holsten said: 'I want people to be aware of strawberry naevus marks so my daughter doesn't grow up thinking she is different.
'It's like that photography company was saying she's not perfect and she is just 18 months old. It needs to change.'
Unhappy: Ms Holsten, 20, returned to the shopping centre with Lexi's father Dylan Hudson, 20, a baker, and questioned a woman from Domingo Portrait Services. She claims the company refused to apologise
She added: 'I often have her pictures taken by another firm so I've got photos to look back on of her growing up, but I thought I would give this company a go.
'On the day they were taken, nothing was mentioned about her birthmark and I didn't mention it either because to me it's normal.
'When I collected them I was with a friend and Lexi's dad. The woman was rushing me and Lexi was running around so I only had a quick glimpse at them.
'I was on a train when I looked at the photos and thought "where the hell is the birthmark?"
'I could see it had been airbrushed out and it hadn't been done very well. It was the same colour as her skin but you could still see the outline.
I want people to be aware of strawberry naevus marks so my daughter doesn't grow up thinking she is different
Lauren Holsten
'I was really upset and I cried. I've never experienced anything like that. The other company had never asked about it and never offered to airbrush it out.
'Even if they had I wouldn't have it done because it wouldn't look like her.'
Ms Holsten said she spoke to a female employee from the company to stress how upset and 'disgusted' she was.
'She basically said she thought it was a cut, which it quite obviously isn't. She said they edit all cuts out. She was very rude and didn't apologise,' Ms Holsten said.
'A couple of weeks later the shopping centre contacted us to say they had some of the originals for us but we didn't get our money back. We want an apology.'
Ms Holsten, of Sittingbourne, said it was important the birthmark was not hidden because she wants Lexi to feel normal as she grows up.
She said: 'It's not that big to be fair but you can notice it. It's about the size of a five pence piece and it's quite raised too. A lot of people look at it.
Moved: The photography company has been told it can no longer operate from The Forum shopping centre in Sittingbourne, Kent (pictured)
'Her dad once had someone ask him "what's wrong with her?" and I had a drunk person tell me I should be ashamed and disgusted of having a child like that.
'I just bawled my eyes out in front of him.'
Victoria Icuah, an assistant at Domingo Portrait Services Ltd, insisted she had apologised personally to Lauren and said the issue 'has been resolved.'
But she added: 'We did not know it was a birthmark first of all.
'We airbrush the pictures. Any customers who don't want their picture airbrushing, they let us know.
'The photographer didn't know it was a birthmark. If she had told the photographer before he did the picture that it was a birthmark and she didn't want it removed at all then he wouldn't have airbrushed it.
'She should have told the photographer it was a birthmark and she didn't want it airbrushed.
'We sent the original picture to the management and the lady should have received it by now. The issue has been resolved.
'We did apologise to her and said we are really sorry for everything. I then phoned her to apologise.'
She added: 'We have already changed our policy. We are going to make sure we ask parents about birthmarks.'
A spokesman for The Forum shopping centre said: 'Following an investigation into the discrepancy between one of our shoppers and an external photography concession, I can confirm that the situation has been resolved.
'The business in question did not meet our high standards of customer service and will not be returning to the shopping centre.'
A strawberry naevus is a red birthmark which typically fades when a child is around nine years old.

After being told of Mr Borisovichs need for anonymity in order to hide his criminal activity, Mr Moran says he has been in similar situations before and explains to the Russian that he needs to find a lawyer who can create the package that works for you and for the seller.
By law, Mr Moran should inform his company of his suspicions about money laundering and they should refer the case to the authorities. However, later that evening, he phoned Mr Borisovichs assistant and described the deal as too good to be true.
Money laundering expert Jonathan Fisher QC, tells the programme: By continuing with these discussions, the estate agent goes into this with both feet. Lets face it, its mucky.
He later added: Its not a harmless activity, whether its Russia or whether its Nigeria or wherever it is in the world, somebody has lost out as a result of this person presenting himself with the proceeds of crime.
According to the show, From Russia With Cash, James Moran of Winkworth shows the couple around a 3.25million Kensington property and advises them on how to secure anonymity to hide any criminal activity
The second property is a 4.95million three-bedroom home in Chelsea. The undercover reporters are shown around by Peter Phillips, sales director at Chard Estate Agency, which would earn just under 100,000 commission from the sale.
Mr Phillips goes as far as to suggest a lawyer to Mr Borisovich, even giving him advice on what to tell a solicitor so as not to make him suspicious of wrongdoing.
The final property is a five-bedroom home in Chelsea worth 15.75million. It is being sold by Bective Leslie Marsh, which could expect a commission of more than 300,000. Benson Beard, who is looking after the property, again offered a lawyer to help the undercover reporters with their fake situation.
Mr Borisovich said: Its appalling they would all agree to keep my identity secret and suggest different ways of going ahead when it is clearly stolen money.
All the estate agents involved said they either had investigated or will investigate these cases but did not believe they had done anything wrong.
From Russia With Cash is on Channel 4 tonight at 10pm.

	Chapel Point House in Cornwall is a unique Grade II listed home with 4,000 sq/ft of space. It has five bedrooms, four reception rooms and three bathrooms - plus two more separate properties.

There is also a drawing room, known as 'The Long Room', which has a magnificent wooden barrel ceiling and retains all of its original features.
Chapel Point House was designed by the renowned arts and crafts architect John Campbell in 1936.
The property is approached down a long drive and, on top of the main home, the estate - set in 12 acres - has two further houses.
Chapel Point House, near St Austell, Cornwall, was designed by the renowned arts and crafts architect John Campbell in 1936
The principal house, which has 4,000 sq/ft of space, has five bedrooms, four reception rooms and three bathrooms
The waterfront property offers stunning, unrivalled views out to sea - which can be best enjoyed from indoors using this pair of binoculars
It has now been put on the market with Knight Frank for 2.95million.
James McKillop, from Knight Frank's country department, described it as 'an incredible place'.
He said: 'It is a peaceful setting but there is also a nice small community. You really have the best of both worlds.
'The current owners do let the community use the beach, but it is completely private. I haven't sold a home with its own beach for a very long time - it is very unusual.
However, if you want to experience the real deal, it's easy enough to take a short stroll from the house down to its own private beach
Along with this picturesque, sandy beach, the property also comes with a boat house, if its new honours fancied a sail on the water
'The house is Grade II listed and the owners have retained many of the original features.'
Mr McKillop said the current owners use it as their secondary home for the summer months, and the new buyer could do the same.
However, he added that he wouldn't be surprised if it was sold to a local looking for a primary home.
'We have had a huge amount of interest already and it is very possible that it ends up selling for more than the guide price,' Mr McKillop said.

	It would appear Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich wants to keep the wheels moving when he returns to the open water after having the exercise bikes delivered to his yacht in Oban, Scotland.

It comes 48 hours after the billionaire was seen walking his dog with a middle aged entourage in tow, dressed in comfortable slacks, jogging bottoms and fleeces.
Mr Abramovich was accompanied by five of the wealthiest men in the world, including senior figures from his firms and the son of a Russian governor, as he walked his pet corgi on theIsle of Arran.
He is understood to be holidaying in Scotland this week before making his way to the more climatic South of France.
The billionaire Russian's 557ft yacht, Eclipse, moored in Rothesay Bay last Thursday afternoon after making an unexpected stop in nearby Greenock, on the River Clyde, on Wednesday.
He is understood to have been flown to the yacht by helicopter after arriving into Glasgow airport by private jet earlier in the day.
Pictured on a bike ride on the Isle of Bute, Abramovich stopped to chat to a resident and said he was 'enjoying the holiday' despite the odd downpour.
The RealRyder indoor bike (similar to the one pictured) ismade in America, and marketed as a 'fluid, multi-dimensional indoor riding machine'
Keeping active: Mr Abramovich has been pictured on a bike ride on the Isle of Bute, Scotland, where he stopped to chat to a resident and said he was 'enjoying the holiday' despite the odd downpour. The 48-year-old is a big cycling fan, and was seen riding a 3,000 bike

The Russian billionaire and his family are expected to next visit the Isle of Islay.
Mr Abramovich was seen chatting happily with residents who had gathered on the promenade before setting off on his two-hour cycle around the island.
The group were seen taking food with them on their trip, so it is thought he might have stopped for a picnic.
He looked 'exhausted' on his return to the pier, one witness told MailOnline. Another told the Telegraph that he gave a thumbs up to some children who started singing 'Chelsea' before heading back to his yacht, the Eclipse.

The teenager, who has not been named because of his age, was also ordered to help tackle cyber crime as part of his rehabilitation.
After the verdict, a Lizard Squad Twitter account boasted that the teenager had avoided a jail term.
One tweet read: 'Zeekill got a suspended sentence for 2 years. 0 time spent in prison.'
Another tweet said: 'Basically he'll be monitored for 2 years by the local police. Gotta love Finland.'
Boast: Hacker group Lizard Squad took credit for disruption over the Christmas period on Twitter
LIZARD SQUAD, A NETWORK OF 'VOCAL AND TAUNTING' HACKERS
Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which is described as 'vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious'.
The group seeks to cause mayhem online 'for a laugh' and has called itself the 'next generation Grinch' after the children's character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks.
Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the 'dark web'.
Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony.
Last August, it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley.
Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: 'If they're coming after you, you're going to have a bad day.'
At the time, Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation online network, saying it wanted to expose their poor security.
The attack  left 160 million users unable to use their consoles, including children who had just received them as Christmas presents.
The hacking meant that downloaded games could not be played and gamers could not compete against others around the world.
Disruptions began on Christmas day and continued for several days.
Parents were so angered by the issues with the machines, that they wrote hundreds of messages to both companies on Twitter accompanied by the message '#christmasruined'.
In April, Zeekill was also implicated in an harassment campaign against a 20-year-old who was the victim of an online hoax.
The victim's house ended up being called by thousands of people after they were given his telephone number thinking it was the hotline for a car competition.
Zeekill was also found guilty by Espoo District Court of tampering with servers at MIT and Harvard University as well as money laundering, it was reported by Sky News .

	In 1961, Cliveden played host to the most heinous of all scandals that nearly brought British parliament to a standstill: the infamous Profumo affair.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
Here, historian and author Natalie Livingstone, whose husband now owns the Grade 1 listed property, shares an extract of her new book,The Mistresses of Cliveden: Three Centuries of Scandal, Power and Intrigue, with FEMAIL - and provides a compelling insight into what really went on behind closed doors...
Christine Keeler at Cliveden House, the scene of the 1963 Profumo scandal
It was a sultry night in July 1961, the hottest of the year so far. Christine Keeler, an arrestingly seductive 19 year-old showgirl, was frolicking in the swimming pool at Cliveden with her friend Stephen Ward.
At the time, Cliveden was a private residence owned by Wards friend Bill Astor, who leased him a cottage at the foot of the estate.
Usually Ward asked permission to use the pool, but tonight Bill was occupied by a more sober dinner party in the main house. The pool was tucked away in a walled garden on the west side of the property, so the group thought nothing of going for an impromptu swim without giving Astor prior warning.
Moonlight, warm air and water made for a potent aphrodisiac. The party grew raucous, and at some point, Keeler shed her swimsuit in a bet.
Take a look inside the beautiful Cliveden House

Profumo tracked Keeler down and arranged to meet her while his wife Valerie, left, was visiting his Warwickshire constituency. It marked the beginning of a tepid, half-hearted liaison
Up at the main house, the company at dinner included Field Marshal Ayub Khan, President of Pakistan, John Profumo, secretary of state for war, and his film star wife, Valerie. The hosts were Bill Astor, who had inherited the house from his parents, Waldorf and Nancy, and Bills wife, Bronwen.
After dinner, the hosts, Bill and Bronwen Astor, decided to take advantage of the balmy night and suggested a stroll down to the swimming pool to show off a newly-installed bronze statue of their son riding a dolphin.
What they actually saw, as they rounded the corner, was the lithe form of Christine Keeler standing naked in the moonlight, her feet making damp prints on the terracotta tiles, her pale skin goose-bumping in the night air. Profumo was mesmerised.
Late that night, Keeler returned to London to pick up a couple more of Wards girlfriends, and the next morning they were all driven back to Cliveden by the Russian naval attach and intelligence officer, Yevgeny Ivanov.
The group spent a lazy Sunday by Bill Astors pool, where Ivanov challenged Profumo to a swimming race.
Just before Keeler left that evening, Profumo, who, according to Ivanov, had been flirting outrageously with the young girl, asked for her contact details. Ivanov drove Christine back to Wards flat where, the Soviet attach would later claim, they slept together.
The struggles and sacrifices of  women, such as Nancy Astor, left, Cliveden's last great mistress, Britain's first female Member of Parliament, and one of the most controversial and colourful women in British political history, andPrincess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, right, is detailed in Livingstone's new tome
Two days later, Profumo tracked Keeler down and arranged to meet her while his wife Valerie was visiting his Warwickshire constituency. It marked the beginning of a tepid, half-hearted liaison, which Keeler  who once cooked them sausages before they had sex in front of the television  described as a very, very well-mannered screw of convenience.
The weekend at Cliveden was the first act in a drama that would bring down a government and change the course of British history. The apparent mnage  trois between the minister of war, a Soviet spy and a good-time girl made Cliveden synonymous with scandal in the collective consciousness of an entire generation.
But the outraged headlines and lurid scoops of the Profumo Affair  as it came to be known  were nothing new.
During its dawn in the 1660s as much as its twilight in the 1960s, Cliveden was an emblem of elite misbehaviour and intrigue.
Indeed, the 350-year history of the house began when a powerful politician decided to build a secluded mansion in which to enjoy his affair with an ambitious courtesan not much older than Keeler.
The courtesan was Anna Maria, Countess of Shrewsbury, and the politician George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, a childhood friend of Charles II and one of the wealthiest men in England. When Buckingham bought Cliveden in the 1660s, it comprised two modest hunting lodges set within 400 acres of land. Over the following decade, he transformed it, landscaping the gardens and constructing a magnificent house as an ode to his passionate affair with the countess.
A monument to the tragic and bloody consequences of the affair remains at Cliveden today.
Carved into the grass, inlaid in brickwork, is a rapier with an elegant handle, the sort a gentleman would have used in a duel. Alongside it lies a date: 1668. It commemorates the day on which a duel was fought between two of the most powerful people in the land, the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of Shrewsbury.
They were fighting for one woman  Anna Maria  Shrewsburys wife and Buckinghams lover. The duel was to the death. Buckingham killed Shrewsbury and claimed Anna Maria as his prize.

Cliveden sits just five miles upriver from Windsor Castle and fewer than 30 from the Palace of Westminster
Cliveden sits just five miles upriver from Windsor Castle and fewer than 30 from the Palace of Westminster in London, a privileged location that would be crucial to the lives of its residents.
Its outlines have changed little since the 17th century, and, then as now, Cliveden is one of Englands most breathtaking landmarks.
To the south west, the grounds overlook the Thames from the tall chalk cliffs that give the site its name  over the centuries it has also been spelt Cliefden, Clifden, and Cliffden.
Further north, the cliffs, which are densely planted with oak, beech, ash and chestnut, dip into a hollow, and the gardens trail like skirts down to the water. At the top of these gardens, at the end of a long parterre, and raised to an even more imperious height by an arcaded terrace, stands the house itself, an elaborate Italianate mansion, flanked by two wings and approached by road from the north, down a long gravel drive.
The Mistresses of Cliveden: Three Centuries of Scandal, Power and Intrigue by Natalie Livingstoneis the story of five remarkable women, and a biography of the extraordinary house in which they lived
In April 2012, Cliveden became central to my life when my husband acquired the property. When it came into our possession it was no longer a private residence  Cliveden had been reincarnated as a university and a hospital, and latterly run as a hotel. But amid its faded charms there were clues everywhere to the past lives of the estate, most noticeably in the portraits of the houses former mistresses.
In the great hall hangs a portrait of Anna Maria, the original inspiration for the house, a courtesan much maligned in her own time and misunderstood by subsequent generations.
Carved into the staircase is Elizabeth, Countess of Orkney, a formidable intellect, power-broker and long-time lover to Britains conqueror of 1688, William III. Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, the Queen that Britain was promised and then denied in the middle of the 18th century, is immortalised in a painting over the grand staircase, while the fourth mistress, Harriet, Duchess of Sutherland, a glittering society hostess and the closest confidante of Queen Victoria, presides over the dining room.
Finally, hanging beside the fireplace in the great hall is John Singer Sargents portrait of Nancy Astor  Clivedens last great mistress, Britains first female Member of Parliament, and one of the most controversial and colourful women in British political history.
The struggles and sacrifices of these women, their juggling of outer image and inner life, are familiar and universal. Their privileges, however, were extraordinary.
It is from their elite viewpoint that this book narrates the tumultuous events of the last three centuries: Restoration and Glorious Revolution, aristocratic rise and fall, two world wars and the Cold War.
Along the way there are tales of fanaticism and fashion, of censorship, disease, slavery and the unlikely correlation between gardening and warfare.
The Mistresses of Cliveden is the story of five remarkablewomen, and a biography of the extraordinary house in which they lived.
As strange and various as the house itself, it is by turns a historical epic, a political thriller, a family drama, and an intimate history of the relationships between people and place.
Above all, it is a story about sex and power, devotion and betrayal, love and loss, seen through the eyes of a dynasty of trailblazing women who steadfastly evaded, exploited, and confronted the expectations of their times.
The Mistresses of Cliveden: Three Centuries of Scandal, Power and Intrigue by Natalie Livingstone is published by Hutchinson (Out now 25 Hardback and Ebook)

	James South choked to death after student nurse fed him sausage and mash

	James South (pictured), from Aviemore, Scotland, was being fed via a tube through his nose and had a deliberately obvious sign where he lay warning ward staff that he shouldn't be served solid food.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>It was the student nurse who fed him the meal's first day on the ward.
A staff nurse, who was aware of Mr South's limitation, was assigned to oversee her.
'However the staff nurse became severely unwell and another staff nurse was assigned,' Mr Mayne told the court.
'An auxiliary, who had attended the handover but was unaware that Mr South was nil by mouth, asked him what he wanted [to eat] and she completed the menu card for him.'
Mr Mayne said the Health and Safety Executive concluded that NHS Highland had not effectively managed the risk to patients with dietary requirements and did not have an effective system in place for communicating the nil by mouth status of Mr South.
An auxiliary nurse helped Mr South fill out his lunch menu and a student nurse served him, soup and sausages and mashed potato (stock photograph) - followed by ice cream
The region's health board - NHS Highland - was fined 40,000 for the fatal blunder, which happened at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness
NHS Highland admitted a breach of Health and Safety.
Defence counsel Peter Gray QC said: 'This was an isolated failure at operational level. The failing relates to one ward in one hospital on one day.
'It is not a systematic failure and the organisation has no previous convictions.
'But it is accepted had the system which was in place been robustly applied on that day, the death would not have occurred.'
Had the system which was in place been robustly applied on that day, the death would not have occurred.
Defence counsel Peter Gray QC
Sheriff Margaret Neilson said: 'The penalty imposed is not meant to measure the value of someone's life. A significant financial penalty is appropriate here. A death has occurred due to a public body's failure, but I note that it has taken steps to rectify the failings. This was a tragic but isolated incident.'
Outside the court, Mr South's mother Sandra South told the BBC : 'I do not bear any grudges and want to say that the care he received in intensive care was wonderful.
'However, I wouldn't like to comment on what I think about ward 11.'
Dr Rod Harvey, Board Medical Director for NHS Highland, said: 'On behalf of NHS Highland I firstly want to acknowledge that this has been a tragic incident for the family.
'The systems we had in place were not consistently good enough and had they been more effective this death could have been avoided. This is something we deeply regret and for which we apologise unreservedly to the family.
'It is also important to emphasise that we have taken this extremely seriously from the outset. We carried out an immediate investigation, and reported the case to the Procurator Fiscal and Health and Safety Executive. We have fully cooperated with the investigation including making a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity.'

	Dr Khaulath Mohamed, pictured, was admitted to hospital in Manchester when she was 36 weeks pregnant, claiming she could not breathe and pleading to be given an emergency cesarean.

'Going forward, I hope that in future doctors are not so quick to dismiss patient's claims. Yes, there's always going to be a level of anxiety attached to it but the patient knows their own body.
'If a patient tells you something it is your job to respond. I feel that although the doctors fought very hard for her at the end, had they listened to her at the start all of this could be prevented.'
Dr Mohamed, who was born in the Maldives, was described as her family as a 'true inspiration' and became the firstperson from the island of Fuvahmulah to receive a PHD when she graduated in Political Science from Manchester University in 2008.
Dr Mohamed became the first person from the island of Fuvahmulah, Maldives, to receive a PhD
While pregnant with her fifth child, Sasha, Dr Mohamed began coughing-up blood and experiencing flu-like symptoms. On February 3 2013, she was taken to hospital with a raised respiratory rate and blood pressure.
She underwent a chest X-ray and other tests for a pulmonary embolism and possible pneumonia and was given antibiotics although no definitive diagnosis was made.
Dr Mohamed's condition deteriorated and she was placed on a high dependency ward before her doctor decided the safest course of action was an induced labour on February 11.
After the delivery, Dr Mohamed's condition worsened and four days later she was transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she was placed on a life support machine. She died on April 7.
Her cause of death was found to be respiratory failure as a result of an underlying chest infection.
Speaking at the inquest, Rihula said the family felt the doctors did not believe her mother when she said she couldn't breathe.
'For the first day she kept asking to deliver the baby and they said it would make it very complicated if they did that but she was asking for it. I have concerns about what is in the medical notes.
'There was a lot of distress recorded and a quote, "I am dying. My organs are failing".
'There was also a comment "you are being mean" and her saying "I cannot breathe". The notes say she feels unwell, is crying and asking for the baby to be delivered because she thinks she is dying.
'She says she thinks she is dying and her lungs are failing. I do not understand why anyone would write "self-induced". Had it been self-induced would it have got so bad?'
The inquest was told the words 'self induced' may have been entered on the medical notes as Dr Mohamed's breathing difficulties worsened as she became more anxious.

Dr Teresa Kelly ,a Consultant obstetrician at St Mary's Hospital who wrote the medical notes, toldthe inquest she took Dr Mohamed 'very seriously'.
She said: 'Although we had some concerns about her behaviour we knew she had a physical illness that needed to be treated.
'I do not think we were worried about her making it up. When I went to see her she was certainly breathless.
Claims: Dr Mohamed with her daughter Sama
'What you are taught in medical school is that when people have difficulty breathing it is difficult for them to complete a sentence. She was able to speak.
'She did feel we were not taking her seriously but we were because we were continuing investigations.'
Doctor confirmed that not performing a C-section was the 'safest method of delivery' due to Dr Mohamed's respiratory difficulties, her weight and diagnosis of gestational diabetes.
A meeting was held following her death but doctors said they would not have changed the way they treated Dr Mohamed.
The hearing was told some medical notes had gone missing in relation to the tragedy.
Recording a narrative verdict Coroner Jean Harkin said: 'Mrs Mohamed's condition was not what was usually encountered.
'We heard evidence of her speaking coherently and able to complete full sentences but she was very distressed and sometimes she could not complete sentences.
'We heard from the family that she was not being listened to and her concerns were not taken into consideration. The notes refer to "self-induced".
'Maybe in future doctors writing "self-induced" in the notes take into account circumstances and possibly elaborate to prevent ongoing confusion when lay people and myself read such notes.
'I have no doubt that all of those involved in the care of Mrs Mohamed performed to the best of their ability.'

	Garage manager Richard Dickenson, 47, doused his one-bedroom bungalow in Leeds, West Yorkshire, with petrol before torching the property. The blaze created a explosion which tore the roof off.

The prosecution's case was that Dickenson had deliberately stored up to 12 gallons of petrol in the property and had moved his prized Harley Davidson motorbike and BMW sports car out of harm's way before starting the blaze.
During the hearing Dickenson disputed the claim. He said he had become stressed at work and was upset due to his wife being in poor health.
He said she had moved out of their home before the incident and her family were not talking to him.
Explosion: The garage manager doused his one-bedroom bungalow with petrol before torching the property.The blaze created an explosion which tore the roof off the property (pictured)
Damage: Six other properties had to be evacuated during the incident which was attended by 45 firefighters on May 28 last year. The scale of the damage done toDickenson's home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, is pictured
He told Leeds Crown Court: 'I just snapped, I was crying my eyes out. It was just one thing after another going wrong.'
Dickenson insisted that he only had three gallons of petrol in the property and didn't think he would place his neighbours in danger.
He said: 'I lit the paper and threw it onto the sofa. I sat down and watched the flames. I don't know how long for. It might have been only for a few seconds.
'Then there was this almighty bang.'
Sentencing Dickenson, Judge Cahill said she concluded that it was a planned act of revenge more than a momentary reaction.
She said she believed Dickenson had been upset at the situation he found himself in but at the same time he had relationships with two other women and his upset was more self pity.
Blown off: Eye-witnesses said they saw 10ft-high flames on the roof, which was destroyed (pictured), and fire crews from across West Yorkshire were called in to help control the blaze
Neighbour, Amanda Swift, 43, said: 'I was driving down the road at about half nine when I just heard this big bang, and saw these huge flames, and smoke everywhere. The roof had been blown off, it was horrific'
She added: 'This was a deliberately planned act for his wife and children turning their backs on him. I do not accept that he intended to kill himself.'
John Batchelor, mitigating, said Dickenson was 'emotionally volatile' at the time of the incident.
Detective Inspector Sean Duggan, of Leeds District CID, said: 'Dickenson's actions in deliberately starting a fire at his home caused an explosion which could have had far more serious consequences for people in proximity of his address.
'As it was, he was the only person who was injured.
'The incident required a significant response from the emergency services and Dickenson had to be rescued from the property by firefighters.
'It also caused understandable concern among local residents.
You are a manipulative and self-centred man who has little regard for the feelings of others
Judge Sally Cahill QC
'Arson is rightly treated as a very serious crime and the sentence he has received should remind people of the consequences of potentially lethal behaviour like this.'
Eye-witnesses said they saw 10ft-high flames on the roof, which was destroyed, and fire crews from across West Yorkshire were called in to help control the blaze.
Next-door neighbours Joyce and Barry Bedford heard the blast as they were sat watching television.
Mr Bedford said: 'I grabbed Joyce and pulled her out of the house and into the street where we could see huge flames and smoke everywhere.
'Everyone was out in the street, calling the fire brigade, looking to see what was going on.
'The roof tiles were all over the place, it was smoky and black and there were massive flames.'
Neighbour, Amanda Swift, 43, said: 'I was driving down the road at about half nine when I just heard this big bang, and saw these huge flames, and smoke everywhere.
'The roof had been blown off, it was horrific.'

'They were standing on the roof of my neighbour's car. He's had thousands of pounds worth of damage done.
'They were urinating in the street and doing number twos as well. I was hosing them down from my garden the next day.'
Amanda Barry, also of Shooters Hill, said her husband had earlier overheard travellers, who were sat outside the Red Lion pub on July 2, say they were celebrating a wake.
She said: 'It started to get quite noisy outside at about nine o'clock.
Witnesses say a large group of travellers involved in the fighting were attending a wake and had been swigging from beer cans in the street
'The neighbours and I came out to see what was going on and they were everywhere.'
Mrs Barry said nearby restaurant The Jasmine was forced to close early at around 6pm after a group of travellers became angry when they were refused use of the toilet.
The 37-year-old mum-of-four added: 'They began to urinate in the street outside the restaurant and glasses were being thrown into the restaurant garden.'
Amanda Barry, also of Shooters Hill, said her husband had earlier overheard travellers, who were sat outside the Red Lion pub (pictured) on July 2, say they were celebrating a wake
Mrs Barry said around 30 to 40 travellers' caravans arrived on the field opposite her house over the weekend but left on Monday morning after Greenwich Council intervened.
The caravans have since been photographed on Plumstead Common.
Simon McDonagh, 33, a Tottenham car salesman and David Ward, 38, unemployed from Enfield, have both been charged with affray and appeared in custody at court on July 4.
A third man, who was arrested, has been released without charge.

	Thomas Meston, finance chief at Fortelus Capital Management, was reportedly getting ready to leave work on a Friday when he received a call from someone claiming to be from Coutts, in London.

Bloomberg reports that when Meston logged on to the firm's online bank account the following Monday, he saw that 742,668 had gone.
According to court papers, Coutts also had no record of the Friday phone call.
Mr Meston is now being sued by Fortelus, which says he breached his duty to protect its assets.
He denies he was negligent and says he acted honestly.
He was reportedly getting ready to leave work on a Friday when he received a call from someone claiming to be from Coutts.But little did he know, he was victim of a so-called 'Friday Afternoon Scam, whereby fraudsters impersonate bank staff to steal money from clients' accounts specifically on a Friday afternoon
Jason Ferdinand, a director at Coventry University who runs the UK's first cyber security MBA course, said much fraud happened because of human error.
He said employees 'often assume that they do not have to think about security because a machine or software is doing it for them.'
Fortelus lawyer Daniel Astaire told Bloomberg no client funds were affected by the breach, that this was an isolated incdient and that police were now investigating.
Mr Meston 'believed that he was preventing a fraud from being carried out against the claimants, and this belief was reasonable,' his lawyers said in court papers.
The Solicitors Regulation Authority recently revealed it was receiving four reports a month of law firms being tricked  in so-called Friday afternoon scams.
Fraudsters often gain access to firms online systems via malicious software sent through unsolicited emails, Law Gazette reports. 
They then intercept emails in an attempt to take money from client accounts, and often are followed by telephone calls from the fraudsters pretending to be from counter-fraud teams.

	The 73-year-old man was filmed on another motorist's dashboard camera driving his silver BMW towards oncoming traffic after he accidentally joined the northbound side of the A23 near Brighton

'I noticed this car travelling on the wrong side from the distance of about 50 yards when I was about half way through my journey.
'I was in complete disbelief and shock. I decided to call police, so I pulled over on the nearest layby.
'I was in such state that I could not express myself clearly to the operator, but he told me that they were dealing with the situation.'
The student who filmed the newly-released footage says he was in such shock he could barely talk to police
The motorist was eventually stopped after driving for seven miles in the outside lane of the busy A-road
Minutes later, Mr Wierciak managed to catch up with the car and watched as other motorists tried to warn the pensioner and other drivers of the danger.
He then witnessed several near misses and was even hit by debris as a van skidded to avoid a head on collision with the car.
He said: 'One van skidded sideways just a few feet in front of me and debris from under the wheels hit my car.
'Later on I saw this car at roundabout, where A23 crosses with A27, being stopped by police. It was the longest and most terrifying journey to Brighton I've ever had.
In a statement, a spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'A man drove the wrong way down the A23 towards Brighton for several miles.
'The 73-year-old from Burgess Hill got onto the dual carriageway shortly before 10am on Monday, November 10 after going in the wrong direction down a slip road at Hickstead.
'He then drove his silver BMW south along lane three of the northbound carriageway.'
It is understood the pensioner turned off this roundabout onto a road which becomes the slip road
When drivers are told to turn right onto a country lane, the elderly man carried on onto the duel carriageway
The police statement continued: 'Vehicles heading north had to take evasive action to avoid him. A Volkswagen Transporter, driven by a 25-year-old man from Lancing, hit a telegraph pole as he steered off the road, causing minor damage to his vehicle. He was not injured.
'Road policing unit officers intercepted the vehicle on the A23 to the north of the Mill Road roundabout in Brighton.
'The driver stopped his BMW after seeing the marked police vehicle travelling towards him slowly at the head of the traffic.'
The elderly driver was examined by paramedics after the incident last year and is understood to have become confused during his drive.
The police spokesman added: 'Following medical assessment, the DVLA was made aware of the incident and it was anticipated that due to the nature of the man's medical condition, his licence would be revoked.'
Sergeant Mark Baker said: 'We are very grateful to all of the drivers and members of the public who stopped and called us to warn us about the man's driving and for their attentive driving that enabled them to avoid a collision.
'We were able to react quickly and thankfully no one was injured.'

The severe drought  is putting the lives of North Korean children at risk and many are in serious danger of disease and malnutrition, the U.N. children's agency saidthis morning.
In a statement UNICEF said there had been in a sharp increase in cases of diarrhoea among children in drought-affected areas, as access to safe drinking water and sanitation was severely compromised.
'Lack of rain reduces access to clean water and undermines effective hygiene, putting children's lives at risk,' UNICEF Regional Director Daniel Toole said.
The North says it is experiencing its worst drought in a century, with some of its main farming regions particularly hard hit.
No rain: Kim has written to the UN to help deal with water-borne illnesses as desperate citizens are forced to turn to dangerously contaminated water to survive the drought
Barren: North Korasays it is experiencing its worst drought in a century, with some of its main farming regions particularly hard hit
Unable to survive: People walk between corn fields in South Hwanghae, North Korea. There has been almost no rain in this part of the country this year, local say
The country's large number of malnourished children - as many as one in four children according to a 2012 study - heightens concerns about the impact of drought, UNICEF said.
'These children are particularly vulnerable, because children who are malnourished have less resilience to water-borne illness and disease,' the agency said.
Experts said that despite the severity of the drought, the North's fledgling markets and private farm plots should provide a buffer against a famine of the sort that devastated the country in the 1990s.
North Korea's farm production periodically suffers from droughts and floods in the summer, although the state has learned to cut damage by updating farming methods and switching to crops other than rice in recent years.
Thomas Lehman, Denmark's ambassador to both North and South Korea, said that on a visit to the North in late May he could 'clearly see' attempts to deal with the drought in its fields.
'The lack of water has created a lot of damage to the so-called spring crop, and the rice planting is extremely difficult without sufficient water,' said Lehman, who has spoken to U.N. officials about the drought, and visited drought-hit areas.

North Korea has mounted a campaign encouraging the public to help out on farms, and is using mobile water pumps run on diesel and longer pipes to draw water into fields.
'Farm managers reported receiving training in dry rice planting techniques and other measures that they were trying to conserve water,' said Linda Lewis of the American Friends Service Committee, a group that runs farm projects in the North.
North Korea relies heavily on hydroelectric power and suffers from chronic electricity shortages, which can be exacerbated by periods of no rain.
South Korea has also received sharply lower rainfall, particularly in the northern regions, which have got about half the rain of an average year, the national weather agency says.
In early June, Pyongyang's propaganda officials produced two new posters and slogans to spur the fight on drought.
'Let's mobilise the masses and fight with all our strength against the drought,' read one poster that showed a smiling farmer gesturing towards a field of workers with red flags and spades.

The BBC is planning to revive the hit 1990s comedy The Brittas Empire which was set in a fictional leisure centre featuring incompetent boss Chris Barrie playing Gordon Brittas.
It is almost 20 years since the show was last on the nation's screens, but the BBC confirmed that at least one new episode, possibly a Christmas special, is under development.
At its height, more than 10 million people tuned in every week to the latest catastrophe to befall the staff at the fictional Whitbury New Town Leisure centre.

Chris Barrie, pictured, played the overly officious leisure centre manager Gordon Brittas for six years
The show regularly attracted more than ten million viewers between 1991 until it was cancelled in 1997
Barrie, pictured, said that one of the original show's writers was behind the plan and has completed a script
The show starred former Red Dwarf actor and ran between 1991 to 1997.
Barrie, 55, told the Daily Mirror: 'One of the original writers is behind it and, fingers crossed, it happens. The script stage is supposed to be done now.'

They were taken near the village of Nahala, Israel, by wildlife photographer Shuki Cheled, who watched in amazement as the bird tried in vain to swallow the bat whole.
Mr Cheled said: 'We were amazed to see that the prey was actually a bat! The bat was alive and flapping at first.
'The bee-eater proceeded to hit the bat against branches until the bat died.'
Quite a mouthful: Mr Cheled was bird-watching when to his amazement he witnessed the bird killing the bat and attempting to swallow it
The bee-eater killed the bat by hitting it against the branch before grappling with it in its beak in an attempt to swallow it whole
He added: 'The bee-eater spent the following minutes trying to swallow the bat, flipping it over and over, without success.
'Eventually it flew off, with the bat still in its beak, so the eventual outcome remains unknown.'
European bee-eaters are known to feed on flying insects and are not known to try attack something as large as a bat.

	Lindsay Taylor and Paul McGann were only five when they played Mary and Joseph in their school's annual nativity. They reunited on a night out in Liverpool last year and will wed on Sunday.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

Lindsay, 36, said: 'We were five years old and I remember the nativity like it was yesterday.
'Paul was chosen to be Joseph because of his good behaviour and I was picked as Mary, for some reason, because I was blonde with big blue eyes.
'I can remember when we did the nativity and the teacher told Paul to put his arm around me.
'Coaching him, she said to Paul: "You love Lindsay, you have got to protect her."
'I was looking down and rocking this fake baby. It was held in school and I can recall my nan standing in the middle of the aisle taking photos.
Lindsay Taylor donned an old frock and Paul McGann wrapped one of his mother's tea-towels around his head when they took to the stage as five-year-olds, playing the lead roles in the festive re-enactment of the birth of Christ
'Paul was very shy as a boy but we became the best of friends.'
She added: 'It was the start of our friendship and we always knew there was something there.
'I just hope when we get married he hasn't got his mum's tea towel on his head... I'll certainly be wearing a better frock!'
Lindsay and Paul were best of friends at St Bennett's Primary School in Netherton, Liverpool, and met up again in July last year when they were both on nights out with friends in the city.
The couple had gone to different high schools and both had been in other relationships. Taxi driver Paul, 35, has a little girl, Ruby, and Lindsay, who works for a housing association, has a son, Charlie, both three.
Now the old school friends will be centre stage once more - but this time to get married, three decades on from when they were first introduced to one another...as the Holy couple
Lindsay and Paul were best of friends at St Bennett's Primary School in Netherton, Liverpool, and met up again in July last year when they were both on nights out with friends in the city
'I recognised him instantly,' said Lindsay. 'He hasn't changed  apart from the fact that he's now 6ft 3in.
'We started talking and stayed together for a few drinks that night and when we left we swapped phone numbers.
'We both felt the connection again straight away. It's like it was when we were at school, when we are together it's very easy. It just feels like it was meant to be.'
The couple, of Old Roan, Merseyside, got engaged in October with a picture of them as Mary and Joseph on an engagement cake. Family and friends have joked about wedding presents of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
Lindsay added: 'It's been a bit of a whirlwind, but it's really exciting that it began with a special story and now we have got one of our own.
'Paul used to say he was going to marry me. It's incredible that he actually will.
'It's taken all these years but we are finally together and I can't wait - I'm just hoping I can hold it together so my make-up doesn't run.'
She added: 'Our friends and family will be there to help celebrate our wedding and there will be some from school and the nativity play, including my cousin who was the donkey and the Angel Gabriel!'

	Although socially conservative Chile is not following Uruguay's lead on full legalization, it is considering
decriminalizing it for personal use and cultivation.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

Nonetheless, the vote was important, Communist lawmaker Karol Cariola, who is part of President Michelle Bachelet's leftist coalition, told reporters.
President Michelle Bachelet has led conservative Chile on a more liberal path in recent years
'It is a historic day for medicinal users who wish to stop being persecuted and be able to access a medicine that they can grow in their gardens,' she said.
Santiago, Chile's capital, was the site of Latin America's first medical marijuana farm earlier this year. The country watched the experimental project with interest.
Surveys indicate that cannabis consumption is higher in Chile than in the rest of the region, while support among Chileans for drug legalization is increasing.
Since the repressive 1973-1990 dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, Chile has been considered one of Latin America's most conservative countries.
With social attitudes changing, however, left-wing governments have taken baby steps in recent years toward a more liberal path, recently legalizing gay and lesbian civil unions, for instance.
The changes have not been without controversy.
A current bill aimed at reforming Chile's abortion law, one of the strictest in the world, has faced fierce opposition from both the Catholic Church and politicians, including from within Bachelet's own coalition.

	Four-year-old Leia Armitage, from Dagenham, Essex, was born deaf due to not having a cochlea and auditory nerve in both ears but has now had pioneering surgery so that she can finally hear.
      </Description>

'We thought she was going to be deaf for the rest of her life and thought she had no hope of hearing because her situation it was so rare.'
Leia was just 23 months old when she had the operation to have the ABI fitted  becoming one of the youngest people to ever have had the surgery.
The procedure is normally only ever performed on adults if they've had a cancerous tumour.
Her parents learned she was deaf when she was just four-weeks-old, and her condition affects only a handful of children in Britain.
Four-year-old girl born deaf hears after pioneering surgery
Leia was born without a cochlea and auditory nerve in both ears making it impossible for sound to reach the brain but has now had an electronic 'chip' hearing device placed in her ear which allows her to finally hear
The pioneering surgery means her hearing has gradually returned and she was able to hear her parents (pictured together above) sing to her for the first time when she celebrated her fourth birthday last month
They were offered the breakthrough surgery by a team of experts from Guys and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College Hospital.
However, there were serious risks with the procedure, especially on a toddler, since only a few such operations had ever been carried out on children worldwide.
Mr Armitage said: 'We were really nervous because we knew the risks - this was brain surgery.
'We sat for nine hours next to the hospital waiting for updates.
'We had to give it six weeks before the chip could be switched on and on the way home [from the hospital] we noticed she could hear the tube doors opening and closing.
'At first we thought it was a fluke but after six stops we realised she could really hear them - it was incredible.'
Leia's hearing has steadily improved over the last two years as doctors have increased the range of the chip.
On her third birthday, her parents sang happy birthday to her but she didn't really understand it.
But over the past year her hearing has improved so much that she had started to enjoy watching TV and listening to music.
Over the last year, Leia's hearing has improved so much that she can now enjoy TV and listening to music
It means that when she heard her family sing happy birthday on her fourth birthday 10 days ago, she finally heard and understood what was happening - a moment her father said he never thought they'd share.
Her thrilled parents have now secured her a place at Five Elms Primary School which has a deaf provision unit attached to the school.
Mr Armitage said:'We're fortunate that the area we live in has a school with that facility.'
Leia's mother, Alison, 39, who is expecting another baby  a boy - in September, said it's been a long journey but described Leia as 'a little miracle'.
She said: 'We want other parents in the same situation as us to know that there is another option out there for their child's hearing.
'There is hope and you've always got to hang on to that.'
Vicki Kirwin, audiologist at the National Deaf Children's Society, said: 'This is a very rare procedure.
'Leia was the first child to have this treatment in London, with only a handful of other UK children going through the procedure before her, either in Manchester or Italy.
'We are delighted that Leia is making such good progress.'

	Girl, eight, who loves Star Wars forces Disney to change their sexist ways after complaining their Darth Vader outfits were marketed as being ‘for boys’

	Izzy Cornthwaite (pictured), from Chorley, Lancashire, was disappointed to find the Darth Vader outfit she wanted was classed 'for boys' - so she wrote to the industry giant to complain.

Izzy's mum Becky Heyes said: 'All the Star Wars collection was for boys. There was no Princess Leia suit or anything to do with girls.
'A few weeks later, Disney told Izzy that they would change the description from 'boys' to 'kids'.
'We looked online and realised they had changed the entire website. It had gone not just from this particular item, but the whole thing had become gender neutral.'
Izzy's mum Becky Heyes said: 'All the Star Wars collection was for boys. There was no Princess Leia suit or anything to do with girls'
Star Wars fan Izzy forced Disney to change its labelling policy after she complained her Darth Vader costume was marked 'for boys'
Izzy first spotted the unfair labelling after visiting the Disney Store website to pick out something to spend her birthday money on.
'She said she wanted a Darth Vader suit but couldn't have it because it was for boys,' said Becky.
'I said she could have it if she wanted it. She ordered it and a lightsaber to go with it.'
But after receiving the item, Izzy quickly penned her thoughts directly to Disney, and was delighted to receive an email back notifying her of the change.
Following the youngster's complaint, the Disney website has changed all of its outfits to be advertised gender neutral
Her dad Jason Cornthwaite said he was 'extremely proud' of her.
'She is a young girl who sent an email and for them to change things is extraordinary,' he added.
Izzy is now enjoying her Darth Vader costume - and also celebrating her success.
Becky was so pleased that she contacted Laura Bates, who is behind the Everyday Sexism campaign, to tell her about Izzy's story.
Becky said: 'Izzy does realise that it's a big thing. We have talked to her about what she has done being a big thing for gender equality and that people have been campaigning for this for years.'
Han Solo &amp; Chewbacca are back in action in Star Wars teaser
Darth Vader - Izzy's favourite character - stars in 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'
Izzy has kindly written back to Disney to thank them for the change - but she had one more request to make too.
Becky added: 'She asked if it would be too much to ask for them to make a Princess Leia suit. There are no female Star Wars characters yet in the Disney merchandise. They haven't replied, but probably thought we were pushing our luck!'
Izzy's deputy headteacher, Nick Roden said: 'It's amazing that a child so young can manage to get a multi-national corporation to change their policy for the better. We are very proud of her.'

Often made up of experienced Iraqi or Chechen fighters, dependant on the location of the assault, the unit has become a key part of the jihadi group's offensive strategy in recent months.
ISIS calls them 'Inghemasiyoun,' Arabic for 'those who immerse themselves.' Fanatical and disciplined, they have been known to use sandstorms as cover in an offensive as well as wear disguises to infiltrate enemy cities and unleash mayhem.
A recent online video from the group showed a unit, wearing distinctive blue bandanas tied to their arms,preparing to launch an eventually successful attack on the central Syrian town of al-Sukhna.
ISIS shock unit fighters receive final speech before battle
Final preparations before battle, the jihadi group has become ever reliant on using the shock troops
ISIS recently used 70 special forces in an attack on Kobane. Disguised as Kurdish forces, the merciless jihadis killed more than 230 civilians
The ISIS troops are expected to infiltrate the enemy line and go on a murderous rampage until they are killed
'Victory or martyrdom,' the fighters, wearing blue bandanas, scream in a circle around their commander, pledging their allegiance to God and vowing never to retreat.
'They cause chaos and then their main ground offensive begins,' said Redur Khalil, spokesman for the U.S.-backed Kurdish People's Protection Units, which have led a string of military successes against the IS in Syria.
Often the offensives are launched with several co-ordinated suicide bomb attacks, designed to breakthrough the defensive line.
Following the Kobane attack, ISIS released four photos of the suicide bombers used in the attack. Each bomber appears no older than 18, barely old enough to grow a beard.
Praying before battle, the shock units often wear coloured bandanas to help identify themselves more easily in the heat of battle
ISIS militants from the Inghemasiyoun unit prepare for battle, where they are expected to kill as many people as possible, often searching for civilian targets
The shock units are often made up of experienced jihadis from Chechnya, Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq
Each of the soldiers in the unit is expected to detonate their suicide belt if they run out of ammunition
As well as suicide bombers, the jihadi group has left snipers tied to the top of a palm tree with the orders to kill as many enemy troops as possible.
Its forces switch between conventional and guerrilla warfare, using the latter to wear down their opponents before massed fighters backed by armored vehicles, Humvees and sometimes even artillery move to take over territory.
Recently, they beefed up armor of the vehicles used in those attacks to prevent gunfire from killing the driver or detonating explosives.
Those strategies are being carried into new fronts as well, appearing in Egypt in last week's dramatic attack by an IS-linked militant group against the military in the Sinai Peninsula.
Andreas Krieg, a professor at King's College London  who embedded with Iraqi Kurdish fighters, said IS local commanders receive overall orders on strategy but are given freedom to operate as they see fit to achieve them.
That's a sharp contrast to the rigid hierarchies of the Iraqi and Syrian militaries, where officers often fear acting without direct approval.
The jihadis care little for their own safety, wearing only the most basic armour or no protection at all
ISIS have recently made assaults on Tel Abyad and Kobani, in an attempt to gain ground in north eastern Syria
ISIS regards the foreign fighters, particularly European untrained jihadis, as poor soldiers, preferring to use them as suicide bombers and rely on experienced campaigners
Armed with a sniper, one militant patrols through the Ninawa countryside. Snipers are often used by ISIS to pin down enemy positions for hours
In recent months, ISIS's crack team of shock units have relied more on suicide bombings to open attacks
IS fighters are highly disciplined  swift execution is the punishment for deserting battle or falling asleep on guard duty, Iraqi officers said. The group also is flush with weaponry looted from Iraqi forces.
IS stands out in its ability to conduct multiple battles simultaneously, Iraqi army Lt. Gen. Abdul-Wahab al-Saadi said.
'In the Iraqi army, we can only run one big battle at a time,' said al-Saadi, who was wounded twice in the past year as he led forces that retook the key cities of Beiji and Tikrit.
Even the group's atrocities are in part a tactic to terrorize its enemies. It beheads captured soldiers, releasing videos of the killings online. Stepping up the shock value, recent videos showed caged captives being lowered into a pool to drown and the heads blown off other captives with explosive wire around their necks.
The number of IS fighters in Iraq and Syria is estimated between 30,000 to 60,000, according to the Iraqi officers. Former army officers of ousted Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein have helped the group organize its fighters.
Veteran jihadis with combat experience in Afghanistan, Chechnya or Somalia have brought valuable experience.
Named as Abu Khattab al-Ansari, the ISIS child soldier was used in the recent ISIS assault near Kobani
Fatlum Shalaku, 20, from Ladbroke grove, blew himself up in ISIS's assault on Ramadi, Iraq. The British Kosovan had travelled to Syria with his brother and initially joined al-Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra before switching to ISIS. Several months before his suicide mission, Fatlum's brother Flamur,23, was killed in battle
Heavy artillery, often captured for their opponents, is used to soften up the defensive line before a suicide bomb attack by ISIS
Foreigners who join IS often end up as suicide bombers due to their lack of practical fighting skills.
'People go to the Islamic State looking to die, and the Islamic State is happy to help them,' said Patrick Skinner, a former CIA officer now with The Soufan Group, a private geopolitical risk assessment company.
Often arriving with no military experience and just a overwhelming passion to die, many foreign fighters are too useless to do anything but to be assigned to the martyrdom brigades.
In May, ISIS captured Ramadi, capital of Iraq's vast western Anbar province. In Syria, it seized the central city of Palmyra.
The elite shock troops were crucial in capturing Ramadi. First came a wave of more than a dozen suicide bombings including 20-year-old British fighter Fatlum Shalaku.
After hammering the military's positions, the fighters moved in during a sandstorm. Iraqi troops crumbled and fled as a larger IS force marched in.
Since US-led airstrikes in Iraq and Syria have hampered the group's movements, IS has lost ground.  Iraqi troops and Shiite militiamen retook some cities, like Saddam's hometown of Tikrit.
In Syria, Kurdish fighters backed by heavy U.S. airstrikes recaptured the border town of Kobani after weeks of devastating battles. More recently, IS lost Tal Abyad, another Syrian border town.

	She really DOES look this good: L’Oreal moisturiser advert featuring Dame Helen Mirren, 69, is CLEARED by watchdog over claims she was airbrushed

	Watchdog investigated after complaint suggested Oscar winner Dame Helen (pictured) had been airbrushed to digitally iron out her wrinkles in ad for moisturiser filmed on the Thames in London.

The viewer challenged whether both ads - for L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect moisturising cream - 'misleadingly exaggerated' the likely effect that could be achieved by using the product,which costs 24 for 100ml.
But the ASA sided with the French beauty firm, insisting that wrinkles were still visible on the actress' face and that the ads were in no way misleading.
The TV campaign featured The Queen star, who turns 70 later this month, being offered a seat at a bus stop on a dark, wet night, looking unhappy. Her voice-over stated: 'Ever feel like you go unnoticed? And when you aren't, well, enough'.

The TV campaign featured The Queen star, who turns 70 later this month, being offered a seat at a bus stop on a dark, wet night
The allegations focused on age lines around the 69-year-old Prime Suspect star's mouth, which the complainer argued had been wiped in the editing process for both the video and still image adverts
She added: 'It's the science I trust to help me look like me. Nourish and indulge your skin, and show those age spots who's boss. Grow another year bolder. Look and feel more radiant. Our perfect age is now. So are we worth it? More than ever.'
As her voice speaks, several close-ups are shown of Dame Helen's face as she gets changed into a flowing black dress, leather biker jacket and 'bold' make-up, including bright red lipstick.
She is then shown by the banks of the river Thames glancing flirtatiously at a handsome male jogger, and saying to the camera: 'So, are we worth it? More than ever.'
In the print ad for the moisturiser,  an image of Dame Helen was featured under the heading 'Age Perfect' and alongside text that said: 'Age spots appear reduced. Skin feels nourished with moisture. Complexion looks more radiant.'

It added: 'Age is just a number and maths was never my thing!'
L'Oreal stated that, in both the print and video campaigns, they wanted to ensure their depiction of Ms Mirren was in keeping with her public image.
In contesting the complaint, they enclosed four images of the much-loved actress from recent red carpet events, stating that the images of her in their ads were entirely in line with such public appearances, when she had been professionally styled and made-up.
L'Oreal also provided a list of the post-production techniques that had been used in the print ad, none of which related to wrinkles or to the skin on her face or neck, and confirmed that no post-production changes were made to Dame Helen's face in the television ad.

The ASA investigated  over rules regarding misleading advertising, substantiation and exaggeration, but did not find them in breach of any of them.
Reaching an outcome, the national regulator insisted that consumers would expect Dame Helen to have been professionally styled and made up for the photo shoot, and to have been photographed and filmed professionally in flattering conditions.
They said: 'We noted that wrinkles were clearly visible on Ms Mirren's face in both ads, including across her forehead and around her mouth.
'We considered that the recent press images of Ms Mirren would have reflected a similar degree of professional styling and make-up as the images in the ad, without any post-production amendments, and that her appearance in the ads was comparable to those more candid images.
'We therefore considered that the ads had not altered Ms Mirren's appearance in a way that would exaggerate the likely effect that could be achieved by consumers' use of the product, and concluded that the ads were not misleading.'

	Medical experts warn that the nation is becoming 'over-medicalised' as the increased demand for statins, painkillers, diabetes drugs and antidepressants, drives the rise.

They have also more than doubled for two of the most common types of cholesterol-fighting statins, rising from 25million to 60million. Prescriptions for painkillers including aspirin and paracetamol have increased by almost 50 per cent to 68.6 million last year.
But many common drugs cause serious and potentially fatal side effects, particularly if taken on repeat prescription over long periods of time.
Statins have been linked to muscle pain and diabetes, aspirin to stomach ulcers and antidepressants to weight gain, tiredness and possibly suicide.
HUGE BOOM IN CUT-PRICE VIAGRA
The number of prescriptions for Viagra and other erectile dysfunction drugs has gone up by more than a quarter in just one year.
The figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show that last year there were 1.7 million prescriptions for sildenafil - commonly sold as Viagra but also available under other names  compared to 1.4 million in 2013 and a million in 2004.
It is thought the surge could be fuelled by the fact that Viagras patent ended in 2013, meaning cheaper alternatives could be produced. The cost of sildenafil fell by 85.9per cent as non-branded versions became available, the HSCIC said.
Going up: Figures show that last year there were 1.7 million prescriptions compared to 1.4million in 2013 and 1million in 2004
Antidepressants also saw a large increase, with 57.1 million dispensed last year  up from 53.3 million in 2013, and almost doubling from 29 million in 2004.
The most money was spent on drugs for diabetes last year, for the eighth year in a row  rising by 55.3 million, or 7 per cent, in a year to 849.1 million. Atorvastatin, which helps to reduce the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes, was the single drug which saw the greatest increase in prescriptions since 2013, with 4million more being handed out last year.
Three in five prescriptions in 2014 were for patients aged 60 and over. One in 20 were for patients under 16, or those aged 16 to 18 who were still in full-time education.
Experts say GPs feel under pressure to prescribe patients a drug just to feel as though they are doing some good. This is not helped by the fact that appointments last just ten minutes, meaning there is little time to discuss the benefits and risks of medications or offer alternatives.
Patients can end up in the absurd situation where they have to take ever more drugs to treat the side effects of those originally prescribed. Patients on statins can need painkillers if they experience muscle pain as a side effect, while drugs for high blood pressure can cause depression, so patients go on Prozac.
But the more drugs a patient takes, the higher the chance they will interact with each other and lead to harmful side effects.
Dr Aseem Malhotra, a London-based cardiologist and a senior member of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents 220,000 doctors, said: These figures are truly shocking. The third commonest cause of death after heart attacks and cancer is prescribed medication, basically side effects.
We need to be winding back from the harms of over-treating and over-medicalising patients. It should be a wake-up call to a system that is failing.
We are over-medicalising the population because of too much pressure from those with vested interests in the pharmaceutical industry. The system of pay for GPs means there are perverse incentives for them to prescribe drugs, because their earnings are linked to doing so.
Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said the nations increasing reliance on pills was starting to get out of control, adding: It underlines the fact that we are become a nation of pill pushers.
Professor Dame Sue Bailey, chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: Its of serious concern to the medical profession that the number of prescription items has increased so much. Doctors and patients should all recognise that resources arent unlimited in the NHS.
The Academy issued new guidance in May urging doctors not to prescribe so many drugs. They said treatments can cause substantial harm as well as incurring huge costs for the NHS, and told doctors to spell out the potential risks clearly to patients.

If the proposed change went ahead, the exemption would cover using as many hounds as were necessary for wildlife management.
This would help farmers, especially in upland areas, who have struggled to protect livestock from foxes since the ban.
It would also help foxes suffering from mange and dying a slow, lingering death.
The measure would help farmers, especially in upland areas, who have struggled to protect livestock from foxes since the ban
That means that the most controversial types of hunting, such as hare-coursing, will not come back.
The proposal would bring the law in line with the situation in Scotland, meaning it will be difficult for the Scottish Nationalists to object.
In addition, the use of the 'statutory instrument' procedure means it will take 90 minutes of debate, not days and weeks of valuable parliamentary time.
Cameron will put the idea to his partys 1922 Committee tomorrow.
It means the issue could then be debated as early as next week, and - if passed by MPs - it would go to the Lords for debate in the autumn.
If approved there, it would take effect immediately, so the new regime would begin this winter.

	What's coming in George Osborne's Budget, by QUENTIN LETTS

	It may be painted as a battle between atheists and churchgoers by Sunday trading hours, expected to be relaxed by George Osborne, are actually more about the British way of life.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
This afternoon, George Osborne will stand at the Commons despatch box and, if yesterdays leaks are any guide, announce that the Book of Genesis needs rewriting.
Mr Osborne wants to blow away remaining constraints on shops Sunday opening hours. Any last concept of the Sabbath Day being somehow different from the rest of the week will be dynamited by our metallically efficient Chancellor.
The opening Book of the Bible will therefore need to say: And on the seventh day Gods alarm clock rang, and He awoke bleary-eyed, and He put on his Asda uniform and went trudging off to work just like every other day of the week because He had been told that this was the global race and He had to get real.
George Osborne reportedly intends to allow all supermarkets to open for as long as they like on a Sunday. At present, the bigger shops are limited as to how long they can trade on Sundays. Corner shops can do what they like.
Budget day: George Osborne is expected to announce relaxation of Sunday trading hours this afternoon
Nonsensical
Indeed, Sundays are often the busiest day of the week for family-run newsagents. But any premises bigger than 280 square metres is limited on Sundays to six continuous hours. This is why big supermarkets tend to open between 10am and 4pm.
Mr Osborne and his acolytes say this is a nonsensical state of affairs. They think longer opening hours could increase Britains prosperity and make life more convenient for shoppers. His spinners are also saying that if we do not reform Sunday hours, then London could be left behind by Paris and New York, where opening times are less regulated.
Opponents reject this and say Sunday should be kept different. Small shopkeepers, in particular, feel under threat. Such people would once have been prized greatly by the Tory Party as romantic emblems of enterprise and hard work.
Mr Osborne has little time for political romance. He is a dry, flinty-minded fellow, and it is probably fair to say that his social circle contains more multinational executives and big-business lobbyists than it does British-Asian corner shopkeepers or parsons in the Anglican Church.
Benefits: Mr Osborne argues longer opening hours could increase Britains prosperity and make life more convenient for shoppers
I hesitated before making that not terribly good joke about Genesis because the subject before us is too easily characterised merely as a squabble between churchgoers and the rest of 21st-century Britain, which is largely heathen.
Yes, the Church of England and other faith organisations are unhappy about this further erosion of Sunday, in part because it will make it even harder to attract congregations to Sunday services.
But the matter is about much more than that. It is a contrast between capitalists and trade unionists, Ebenezer Scrooges and Pa Larkins as much as it is another strand of that wearisome tussle between atheists and believers.
The Bible contains truths that can be applied to everyone, regardless of creed. Human nature needs variety in its weekly routine, and the writer(s) of Genesis understood that.
Society depends on a Day of Rest not just to alleviate the tedium of life or even to give working people a chance to catch up on sleep. It needs it for wider reasons of family solidarity, peace of mind and to remind us that there is more to life than mere profit and toil.
Once every day becomes the same, the week will lose any concept of beginning and end. Under Mr Osbornes proposals, the only days when big supermarkets will not be open will be Christmas and Easter Days. You do not have to be too ethereal a philosopher to see that a certain drabness can flow from such homogeneity.
If Sundays become indistinguishable from weekdays, more than ever we will feel like gerbils on a rotating wheel. One might observe, too, that political parties lose something when they concentrate merely on functionality and bottom lines. The Tory Party should aspire to capture hearts as much as winning our economic respect.
Sunday was never just the Lords Day. It was our day, when we could expect to own a few hours and dispense with them as we wished.
Supporters of Sunday trading talk of the liberty of the individual to go shopping when he or she wishes. How about the liberty of supermarket workers? Already they are under pressure to be part of the Sunday work rota. Already, I suspect, that means many families are being broken up on a Sunday, and one parent must look after the children while the other puts in six hours on the till at Tesco.

'The man was treated at the scene before being taken to Kingston Hospital in a life-threatening condition.'
Surrey County Cricket Club chief executive Richard Gould expressed his sadness and spoke of the shock the incident caused, both within the countys wider cricketing community and the Tamil community.
He said: 'Everyone at the club has been deeply saddened to learn of Bavalans death and would like to extend their sympathies to his family, friends and everyone who knew him from within the community of cricket.'
Mr Pathmanathan, pictured, was rushed to hospital by air ambulance but could not be saved by medics
A spokesman for the British Tamils Cricket League (BTCL) said: 'One of our member clubs player Bavalan Pathmanathan, 24, was hit by the cricket ball on the chest while batting and died due to heart failure.
'This tragic accident happened at Long Ditton recreation grounds in a Division 3 match. BTCL expresses deepest condolences to Bavalans family and friends.
'He was an old student of Hartley College in Jaffna, Sri Lanka.'
The National Cricket Conference tweeted: 'So tragic to hear of the death of young cricketer, Bavalan Pathmanathan, whilst playing in Surrey last Sunday. Our thoughts are with family.'
The incident came less than eight months after the cricket world went into mourning after Australian Test player Phillip Hughes was fatally hit by a cricket ball during a first class Sheffield Shield match while playing for South Australia against New South Wales in Sydney.

	People still have little or no protection from being bombarded with requests for cash and there is still no regulators to oversee the cynical trading of givers' details by professional fundraisers.

Energy rip-off (cont.)
Millions paying too much for their energy long-standing customers charged rip-off tariffs  confusing and inaccurate bills, making it hard to compare deals and switch to cheaper suppliers 
As few will disagree, the Competition and Markets Authority has correctly identified much of whats wrong with the Big Six power firms.
Indeed, it finds dual-fuel customers could save 160 a year by switching tariffs  if only the process were less daunting and comparisons easier to draw.
But with complaints soaring five-fold between 2008 and 2013, grave doubts must surely remain over how much difference the CMAs recommendations will make.
Yes, it makes sense that regulator Ofgem should provide a price comparison service, so customers neednt rely on internet firms, many of which are too close to the industry.
But the Mail has reservations over the watchdogs suggestion of a price-cap on the most expensive tariffs, to protect sticky customers who fail to switch.
Wouldnt such a blunt instrument encourage the Big Six (four of them foreign-owned, caring little about British consumers) to charge the maximum allowed  reducing competition further?
Worse still, the watchdogs report offers no answer to the biggest scandal  the speed with which firms increase charges when wholesale prices rise, and their sloth in passing on savings when they fall.
With too few competitors to challenge the Big Six  and green policies driving up bills  this paper fears the outlook for consumers looks as bleak as ever.
The enemy within
MARKING the tenth anniversary of the 7/7 London bombings, MI5 chief Andrew Parker warns of the grave threat posed by Britons who, for whatever twisted reasons, have identified their own country as the enemy.
As he says, they are a tiny fraction of the population. But their warped choice to turn against the freedoms theyve grown up with presents a serious societal and security challenge.
In these blunt and brave words, based not on prejudice but on hard evidence of terrorist activity, he makes a powerful point that many public officials and their political masters might shrink from uttering.
And he underlines the pressing duty of all decent British Muslims to give the security forces every help in rooting out the would-be killers in their midst.

Labour's leadership race descended into acrimony today after supporters of Yvette Cooper were accused of trying to win votes by highlighting the fact that Liz Kendall does not have any children.
Backbench MP Helen Goodman wrote an article saying she supported Ms Cooper because 'as a working mum she understands the pressures on modern family life'.
Ms Cooper then sent a link to the article to her followers on Twitter, sparking a furious response from Kendall supporters.

Toby Perkins, Miss Kendall's campaign manager asked 'is this what it's come to' before venting his fury on BBC Two's The Daily Politics.
He said: 'I think the idea that you say because of one of the candidates is a mother they're the one you should back suggests a paucity of intellectual argument which the Labour Party really should have moved beyond. So I was disappointed with the specific piece.'
John Woodcock, another prominent supporter of Miss Kendall, demanded to know if Ms Cooper had anything to do with the piece.
He added: 'Looking forward to the day someone tells a man they are voting for him because he has a kid and the other guy does not. Will be equally sad then too.'
In the original piece Ms Goodman stressed the importance of parenthood saying: 'Much more more important to me than being an MP and shadow minister is that I am a mum. I have two children and although they are both grown up (supposedly) once a mum always a mum.'

	Small business minister Anna Soubry said plans to give elected mayors and councils the power to allow supermarkets to open for more than six hours on a Sunday were not a threat to family life.

John Hannett, general secretary of shopworkers' union Usdaw, added: 'This Act is a great British compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years and gives everyone a little bit of what they want.
'Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work, whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shopworkers can spend some time with their family.'
He added: 'We will vigorously campaign against such a proposal and we would be looking for the Government to learn from their two consultations and failed trial period (during the London Olympics) by leaving alone the existing Sunday trading arrangements agreed by the main stakeholders in the retail industry.'
But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said lifting the restrictions on Sunday opening would 'take precious family time away from shop workers'
Frontrunner for the Labour leadership Andy Burnham today promised to fight the proposals 'all the way'
SUNDAY OPENING HOURS: END OF A 'GREAT BRITISH COMPROMISE'?
At the moment, large stores can only open for six hours between 10am and 6pm on Sundays, while shops with a floor area of less than 3,000 square feet can open all day.
Attempts to remove restrictions on Sunday trading led to bitter disputes in the Eighties and were abandoned after the Shops Bill was defeated in the Commons in 1986.
A compromise deal was finally agreed in 1994.
The rules were lifted for eight weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, resulting in a significant surge in sales.
But when the Keep Sunday Special group wrote to Mr Cameron before the election asking him to rule out a change in the law, his office said he believed the existing system provided a reasonable balance.
However Adrian Pepper of the Open Sundays campaign group said relaxing Sunday trading laws made sense for modern-day families.
'It is now the norm for adults in most families to be in full time work so the only time they can shop is at the weekend. Restricting Sunday opening makes no sense,' he said.
'The current Sunday trading laws do not preserve any valuable cultural aspects of our way of life.
'They just make life more inconvenient. If you want to go out early on a Sunday morning looking for a wide range of fresh produce to cook for a family Sunday lunch, you cannot.
'If you want to go to church on a Sunday morning, there is even less time to get the shopping done.'
The government claims there is a 'growing appetite' for Sunday trading in high streets and retail parks, and a trial of longer hours during the London Olympics had proved a success.
The Treasury pointed to research by the New West End Company which found two extra hours in the capital alone would create nearly 3,000 jobs and generate over 200 million a year in additional sales.
Freed from the constraints of five years of coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Mr Osborne will use his second Budget of the year to show where he has found 12 billion of welfare savings promised in the Conservative manifesto.
He told MPs that with global economies braced for the impact of the Greek debt crisis, he would use the set-piece to show how the Government intends to 'redouble our own efforts to put our house in order' with continued austerity measures.
Significant savings are expected to the system of tax credits brought in under the previous Labour government to top up the incomes of low-paid working families.
Mr Osborne will use his second Budget of the year tomorrow to show where he has found 12 billion of welfare savings promised in the Conservative manifesto
Mr Osborne is also going further than previously planned in cutting the benefits cap - currently set at 26,000-a-year - not just to 23,000 in London but to a still lower threshold in other parts of the country.
Savings of 250 million will be achieved by forcing 340,000 local authority and housing association tenants on incomes of 40,000 or more in London and 30,000 in the rest of England to pay a market, or near market, rent from 2017/18.
The 600 million-plus annual cost of providing free television licences to the over 75s is also being passed to the BBC from 2018/19 - with the broadcaster deciding whether the policy should continue after 2020.
We need a better economic plan than asking people to spend another day of the week putting debt on their credit cards
TUC chief Frances O'Grady
It may in return be able to extend the licence fee to cover people watching via the online iPlayer and the licence fee is expected to rise in line with the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation.
The Budget is also set to include an end to inheritance tax on family homes worth up to 1 million - at an estimated 1 billion cost to the Exchequer - a key plank of the Conservatives' general election manifesto.
But Mr Osborne appears set to disappoint Tories calling for a cut in the top rate of income tax from 45p to 40p - insisting his priority is raising the tax free allowance to 12,500 and increasing the threshold for the higher rate to 50,000.
The Chancellor is reported to have significant 'wiggle room' because of tax revenues around 15 billion higher than projected at the March budget.
Stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said it also expected the Treasury to receive an additional 700 million this year - twice official expectations - in tax thanks to new pension freedoms.
Millions of over 55-year-olds have since April been able to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy an annuity and the firm said experience from the early months suggested Mr Osborne was set for a big windfall.
Sunday trading has long been a thorny issue, with pressure building to relax the 1994 Sunday Trading Act which allowed smaller shops to open all day but restricted those over 280 sq m / 3,000 sq ft to six hours between 10am and 6pm.
A review by the then Labour government in 2006 resulted in no change amid protests.
But the Treasury said Britain was out of step with international competitors - with Paris having recently relaxed its rules and New York imposing no controls.

	New Conservative MP and former Army captain Johnny Mercer has caused a splash after he was spotted half naked - in an advert for shower gel on American TV.

The new Plymouth MP shot the advert in London before he was elected but after he was chosen to contest the parliamentary seat for Plymouth Moor View in Devon
Mr Mercer had to prepare for the role by shaving his chest and spent hours in the shower to enable camera crews to capture the best footage
In addition to the shower scene Johnny, 38, is seen showing off his strength with his six-year-old daughter Amalie
Mr Mercer said the shoot was 'really fun', adding: 'They sent me and the girls to London for three days.
'Unfortunately, I think it might be the first in a series of adverts but we'll have to wait and see. Hopefully it will be forgotten about quickly.'
After he was nominated to stand for election, the couple got wind that Dove Men were looking to film an advert with an ex-military family and, after being put forward by a friend, decided to make a 'spoof' family video to send onto the marketing agency.
The agency liked what they saw and invited them to London for the shoot.
Even though the clip currently airing on TV in America is only 15 seconds long, wife Felicity Mercer said her daughter and husband shot hours of footage during February half-term in 2014.
She said: 'They made him shave his chest for the shower scene so he spent the week itching which I don't think he enjoyed.
'He had to spend hours in the shower but he was dressed from the waist down, which obviously you can't see.'

Mrs Mercer added: 'It was just something really nice for him and Amalie to do together while me and Joey [their youngest daughter] stood by watching the shooting and editing.
'They really enjoyed it. I don't think Amalie really understood what she was doing until she saw the finished product recently.
'To be honest, once the election campaign kicked-off we didn't think much about the advert but then we received a notification telling us it was on in the States.
'It was an amazing experience and we hadn't done anything like that before.
'I'm really proud of him because it was a father and daughter thing that they shared and I think it was really special.'
