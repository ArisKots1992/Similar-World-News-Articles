	Brother and sister Paul and Rosemary Wiggin left wet puppies outside their Staffordshire home. Pregnant dogs were also kept in a 'filthy and unhygienic' house covered in faeces (pictured).

A court heard officials found faeces ground into carpets, fly eggs in food that had been left out and some dogs soaking wet and suffering without shelter in the garden.
The pair denied failing to provide adequate living conditions for their animals but were found guilty by JPs sitting at Burton Magistrates Court.
Mr Wiggin was given a 12 month conditional discharge, a 12 month ban on keeping dogs and ordered to pay 7,000 costs.
A court heard officials found faeces ground into carpets and fly eggs in food that had been left out for ages
Some of the helpless dogs were also soaking wet and suffering without shelter in the pair's garden
Ms Wiggin was sentenced to a three year conditional discharge, told to pay 1,000 in costs and was also banned from keeping dogs for a year.
Sentencing, District Judge Shamim Qureshi said although the case did not involve cruelty, the pair had shown a complete failure to own up to what they had done.
RSPCA Inspector Jayne Bashford told the court she found an 'chaotic' atmosphere when she visited the home in Burntwood, Staffordshire, last summer.
She said the dogs were removed and with the arrival of new puppies the number has increased to 44 and the bill for boarding them has come to 75,000..
Inspector Bashford added: 'The whole house was very, very dirty.
'There appeared to be an awful lot of ground in faeces and dirt that covered the carpet.

RSPCA Inspector Jayne Bashford told the court she found an 'chaotic' atmosphere when she visited the home in Burntwood, Staffordshire, last summer
'The conditions we found the dogs in were wholly inappropriate.
'There were numerous hazards in the garden including items in a shed stained with faeces and bones in the garden presenting choking hazards.
'The puppies were cold, wet and whining, with no clean and comfortable resting place. I have no doubt they were suffering.
'Whilst I sympathise and understand the defendants did love their animals, they refused to accept any assistance in improving their welfare, and therefore it would have been wholly unacceptable for the dogs to have remained in these conditions.'
The dogs have been removed from the house, but several have since had puppies - bringing their number up to 44 dogs
Mr and Ms Wiggin fought a prosecution brought by the RSPCA for failing to ensure the welfare of the dogs, but a district judge came down in favour of the animal charity
Mr Wiggin today remained unrepentant and said he had been invited by the RSPCA to keep seven of the dogs as long as the rest could be taken for rehoming
He added: 'To my knowledge there is no law defining the amount of dogs you are allowed to keep.
'If our home is good enough for seven dogs, it is good enough for all of them.
'The RSPCA is a charity and has no expertise in animals whatsoever, yet they tell you how to look after animals.
'I have had pets for 48 years, and never been subjected to what I have in the last 11 months.
'Anyone who has got so-called hazards either in the garden or home - even a dog bone - is likely to be subjected to the same charge we were.'

	Phil Jeruzal, 27, left an honest review on the Facebook page of Canada Wood Kitchen and Bar in Falkirk, Stirlingshire, after having an 'average' and disappointing meal - only to be told to 'grow a set'.

In response to the suggestions, Mr Jeruzal replied: 'LOL wow, that is the most hilariously unprofessional response to a customer I've ever received. "Grow a set", good god, amazing.
'Thank you so much this has made my day'.
He later added: 'You can have a go at me all you want - even though its hilariously unprofessional and no self-respecting restaurant should ever actually do it - but its not my fault the food isn't good.'
However, the furore did not end there, and Ms Shaw continued to sarcastically thank the customer for his 'detailed feedback'.
MrJeruzal, had taken his girlfriend (pictured together above) for Sunday lunch at the Canada Wood Kitchen and Bar in Falkirk but they both felt let down by the experience and were disappointed with the 'average' food
Mr Jeruzal, a digital content and marketing assistant, said the Canada Wood Restaurant and Bar in Falkirk (pictured) had a 'great location' but was let down by a 'chef that doesn't really seem to know what he is doing'
She wrote: 'Phil, thanks for your detailed feedback I'm sure all of the idiots that rated us four and five star will appreciate your comments'.
Others on the restaurant's Facebook page also picked up on the 'rude' response and condemned the way Ms Shaw handled the complaint.
Aly Gilardoni wrote: 'Seriously rude behaviour on the restaurants part &amp; due to a cock sure attitude from the 'manager' or whom ever replied I'd say many people will certainly think twice before patronising your restaurant in the future.
Claire Smith added: 'Well with the response from the restaurant, I'd never eat here. Unprofessional and rude.'
Lyn McLoughlin said: 'The response from the company here is a fine example of how not to run your business.'
Mr Jeruzal described the restaurant as 'average at best' and rated his experience with two stars on the Facebook review (pictured). It prompted restaurant boss Monica Shaw to reply urging him to 'grow a set'
The restaurant replied telling Mr Jeruzal to 'grow a set' which he described as 'hilariously unprofessional'
And Dale Wright said: 'The restaurant's response to his post was HIGHLY inappropriate, and was apparently written by a manager who has zero training in how to effectively manage and interact with the public.'
Speaking after the social media spat, Mr Jeruzal said he did not want to complain during the meal because he 'didn't want a confrontation with lunch'.
He said: 'In all honesty I found it hilarious, and it's really made my day. Of course it's a completely unprofessional response.
'I can understand that it might be frustrating to have people complain about somewhere you work, but for the most part I was trying to be constructive.
'The internet does offer you a degree of confidence to say things you wouldn't normally say in person, but then again, I don't want a side of confrontation with my lunch.
Mr Jeruzal said he did not want to complain during the meal because he 'didn't want a confrontation with lunch' but felt he should leave a review. He has now blasted the response as 'completely unprofessional'
'Under a different chef I really think the place could be great, because the location is actually fantastic and the building is lovely.
'They are clearly aspiring for something a little different than what is on offer in the rest of Falkirk.
'But for the time being I probably won't be back, and I can't say their response to me online has done them any favours.
'To be honest, their feisty attitude has endeared me to them somewhat.'
Ms Shaw said she 'didn't wish respond' when contacted for comment.

	Tiny Amir was born on Father's Day, but passed away at just 20 weeks. He was placed in a special cold cot at University Hospital of Wales to allow Amy McDonald and Domonic Reshad precious time with him.

The couple were given a special 'teardrop room' at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, designed for grieving new parents.
Miss McDonald, said: 'He was just perfect - I could see him like his dad but he had my turned up nose.
I got to know my beautiful little boy in those few hours. It meant I could kiss and cuddle him, I even got to know his smell. The cold cot has given me precious memories I wouldn't have had otherwise
Amy McDonald, Amir's mother
'The cold cot kept him that way so we could have him for almost a day before we knew we had to say goodbye.
'I don't know who came up with the idea but I'd like to give them a hug.'
Miss McDonald and hairdresser Mr Reshad took more than 300 photographs  of their baby son.
Relatives were allowed to visit and he met his grandparents, aunts and uncles during the 21 hours he was in the cold cot.
Amy had a normal pregnancy until 20 weeks when a scan showed her baby was seriously ill and she was told to prepare to give birth.
She went into labour on Father's Day and six hours later Amir was born.
Amy said: 'He took a few breaths and then died in my arms - it was the worst moment of my life.
'But I gained so much comfort from him being able to spend just that little bit of time with us in the cold cot.
'I can close my eyes and see him, I have images of him laying on the bed next to Domonic, I know how it feels to hold him in my arms.'
Miss McDonald said:'I got to know my beautiful little boy in those few hours. It meant I could kiss and cuddle him, I even got to know his smell. The cold cot has given me precious memories I wouldn't have had otherwise'
At her 20-week scan Miss McDonald was told her unborn son was seriously ill, and was told to prepare to give birth. After their traumatic ordeal, the couple are now raising money to buy more cold cots to help others
The couple discovered that three other mothers gave birth to stillborn babies at the same time but there was only one cold cot to go around.
The pair, of St Mellons, Cardiff, raised 1,500 to buy another in less than a day but the fund is still growing and they hope to give the hospital two of the special cots.
They will have a little plaque on the side saying: 'In memory of Amir Reshad.'
Miss McDonald, who has two sons Taio, five and Kobi, one, said: 'Some good will come out of my little's boy's brief time in the world.
'It is important to us that parents have the opportunity to spend some time with their stillborn babies to help them grieve.
'We received the most amazing care at the hospital - it wasn't just care it was love and I can't do enough to thank them.'
A hospital spokeswoman said: 'The cold cot has become part of the grieving process for parents who lose a baby in this way.
'We are pleased this couple have gained so much comfort from it.'
Miss McDonald and Mr Rashad are now preparing for their baby son's funeral next Thursday.

A second problem we face is that if Italy cannot get other countries to accept large numbers of migrants, then they have a simple way out. All they have to do is issue an EU passport to migrants and then anyone can come to the UK legally under EU rules.
I firmly believe the EU should follow the example of Australia which, in 2008, made it clear that migrants arriving by boats would not make Australia their home.
The boats stopped coming. The drownings stopped too.
This issue is far more serious than the usual debate about pressure on public services. This is now one of security.
Threat: A boy holds a Tunisian flag as he stands near bouquets of flowers laid at the beachside of the Imperiale Marhabada hotel. Farage said it was time to 'defend our borders'
Security: Police officers detain a migrant during a clash between migrants and a truck driver next of the ferry boat port of Calais, as Farage warned people getting into UK illegally represent security threat
Dramatic moment migrant climbs into lorry cabin
I would pay tribute to our security services. We know over 300 jihadis who have fought for Islamic State abroad are already back in the UK. Around two dozen of those have planned attacks since returning, but have been thwarted.
I suspect one of the reasons we havent had another atrocity on British soil is because our security services have done such a good job.
We must ensure our security services are given the tools they need to keep us safe. But the threat comes from beyond our shores too.
Britain must bear some culpability for destabilisation abroad. It was our government who foolishly bombed Libya into oblivion. It was a terrible mistake.
Where do the people start their journeys across the Med from now? Libya, a country with a growing IS element. IS have already said that they intend to flood the continent with 500,000 jihadi fighters. Even if that only amounts to 5,000, it is still an alarming prospect.
The Greeks and Italian authorities have absolutely no means of screening the individuals who arrive via boat for links with terrorism and extremism.
When I make the argument we must get tough on border controls to ensure the safety of British citizens, I am told Im not being compassionate. We must not let our compassion imperil our civilisation.
I believe we are making one of the greatest mistakes in our history.

Following his death, a Multi-Agency Critical Incident briefing was held with staff from the school, the Education Department, the Youth Service and Health and Children's Service.
Detective Superintendent Gull said: 'The loss of a young person in any circumstance is very sad.
'We are treating the death as unexplained and based on the circumstances as they have presented [a number of suspects] have been arrested on the suspicion of his murder.
'He was found by a lady who was out walking her dog.
'She is okay, under the circumstances, she is a key and significant witness and we are in the process of obtaining a witness statement.'
Friends today describedMorgan Huelin, from the St Lawrence area of the Channel Island, as a 'good kid'
A police officer stands guard in the area where a body was discovered by a dog walker on Saturday morning
The road was cordoned off yesterday while police worked at the scene to gather evidence for their inquiry
He added: 'We have met with senior colleagues [from Victoria College] and I think it is fair to say they are devastated.
'I am sure other pupils and members of staff will also be, in addition to the immediate community.'
Police have not yet revealed how the teenager died and a post-mortem examination is expected to be carried out today.
Friends have since paid tribute to Morgan on social media and by leaving floral tributes at the scene.
Tom Sinel said: 'Tragic news about Morgan, who I coached rugby and knew from Dunlop, sad to lose such a good kid so young. RIP.'
And another friend, called Aaron, added: 'And there you have it. What we all already knew has been confirmed. RIP Morgan. We'll miss you buddy.
One floral tribute read: 'Morgan Huelin, RIP. We hope your family are OK after this tragic day. We send you all our best. You can now rest eternally.'
Another said: 'I feel greatly for those who have lost a key person in their life and I hope things will work out in the end.'
And one anonymous message added: 'It's very sad and upsetting how he's dead. From what I've heard he was very intelligent and would've been a great house prefect.'
At the end of the school day pupils gathered around the wall of the Victoria College chapel where the shrine to Morgan lay. Children brought flowers and could be seen crying.
One tribute said: 'Dear Morgan, I'm so sorry for your loss. We will remember you for your talents. Enjoy your afterlife.'
Another pupil wrote: 'I didn't really know Morgan but I'm still struggling to get my head round this situation. I'm so sorry for your massive loss.'

Neighbour Jenny Norris, 64, who has lived opposite Morgan and his family for 14 years, said today she hoped those responsible were 'brought to justice'.
The grandmother-of-four, a retired pharmacy worker living in Le Clos Sara, St Lawrence, said: 'Morgan was a quiet young man who was very focused academically.
'I read on Facebook that a Victoria College pupil had died on Saturday and I immediately thought of him.
'When it came out it was Morgan I was so sad. I thought what is the world coming to?
'For a young lad like that to die so suddenly, what must have been going on for that to happen to him?
'I remember seeing him walking up the road with his mum Kerry. She and her husband Phil were scout leaders.
Morgan was highly respected by both staff and his peers at the college, not least because of his academic ability, charismatic personality and strong sense of independence
Alun Watkins,  Victoria College head
'His family is lovely. He had two younger brothers and a younger sister but I don't know how old they are.
'Jersey is such a nice place, things like this just don't happen here. I haven't spoken to the family directly but I'll send them a card.
'My deepest condolences go out to them. It's just so awful. You never know what's round the corner.
'I hope whoever is responsible is brought to justice.'
Alun Watkins, headmaster at Victoria College, said Morgan was a 'genuinely honest and good natured young man'.
In a statement, he said: 'The staff and Governors of Victoria College would like to extend their heartfelt condolences and prayers to the parents, family and friends of Morgan Huelin who has left us under such tragic circumstances.
'Morgan was highly respected by both staff and his peers at the College, not least because of his academic ability, charismatic personality and strong sense of independence.
'Morgan had varied interests. He was an excellent guitarist and a fully supportive member of Dunlop House contributing to it in every way he could including shooting, rugby, football and hockey.
'The College will do all it can to offer support to those pupils, staff and families who have been affected by these heart-breaking events.
'We are all incredibly stunned that such a genuinely honest and good natured young man has been taken from us under these circumstances.'
He added that the school would be working closely with the police throughout the investigation.
Morgan's father Phil is a mechanic and his mother Kerry a housewife. He had a Saturday job in a pharmacy in St Helier. 
Paul Greenan (pictured left) killed nurse Tracy Burns (right) in 2005 on the Channel Island of Jersey
The incident is one of a only a couple of murders to occur on the island in the last decade.
Last year,Darren McCormack was convicted of brutally killing46-year-old Colin Chevalier at a property in St Helier.
McCormick, 36, was told  he must serve at least 25 years after he admitted inflicting 40 injuries on his victim during an axe attack.
The court heard McCormick went to Mr Chevalier's house to buy drugs but attacked his victim as he lay in bed, cutting his ear off. He was arrested the following day with the ear of his victim in his pocket.
In 2005, 19-year-old Paul Greenan was convicted of murdering nurse Tracy Burns on the island. The teenager attempted to rape her before beating her to death in the shocking random attack.
Although he admitted killing her, he denied murder but was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life in prison.
And in 2011 a builder on the island knifed six people to death, including his wife and two young children.
Damian Rzeszowski snapped after his wife Izabela admitted having a two-month affair with another man.
He armed himself with kitchen knives and killed her, along with his daughter Kinga, five, and two-year-old son Kacper, at their home in St Helier on August 14 last year.
However, Rzeszowski was convicted of six counts of manslaughter but cleared of murder following a trial.
Anyone with information about the incident should contact Jersey Police on 612612.
MURDER SHOCKS RESIDENTS OF JERSEY WHICH HAS VERY LOW CRIME RATE
Police have previously described Jersey (pictured) as one of the safest places in the Western World
Jersey has a much lower crime rate compared to the rest of the UK.
Police have previously described the Channel Island as one of the safest places in the Western World with recorded crime around half what it is on the mainland.
This is compared to England which has an annual average of 64 crimes per 1,000 people.
In 2011 crime in Jersey reached a 10-year low and it has continued falling ever since.
Just under 1,600 crimes were recorded in the first five months of 2011, which was nearly a third less than in 2004.
And last year, police on the island revealed there had been an by 18 per cent reduction in crime, the third year in a row figures had gone down.
But the image of Jersey as an idyllic destination in the public eye took a severe knock in 2008 when it became the focus of one of the largest child abuse investigations ever conducted in the British Isles.
It was launched after more than 100 former residents of the now infamous Haut de la Garenne care home came forward to report historic abuse by members of staff.

	The failed singer took to Twitter this morning to remind followers that on this day ten years ago, he had been abroad and was unaware of the attacks which killed 52 people and injured 700.

The former reality TV star, who was dropped by his record label eight months after his debut single, went on to fume: 'Sorry I missed the memo where all tweets today were dedicated to the victims of 7/7'.
He then added: 'I knew the faux outrage it would cause. That's Twitter for you,' when accused of mincing his words.
Fury: Incensed Twitter users responded to his comments within minutes, describing him as 'disgusting'
He hurriedly posted a photograph of Tweets he had written in 2011 praising those who helped the injured and affected as 'heroes'.
Later the singer, who now performs in clubs and pubs, took to Facebook to write a more lengthy attempt to explain his comments.
'We all have an idea of what we were doing at an important event. 9/11 i was staying at a friend's house and I was in Dixons, Putney to watch the events unfold. 7/7 was a weird one,' he wrote in a bid to explain the original tweet.
Flop: Brookstein was dropped from his record label just eight months after winning The X Factor in 2004
'I had an awful June. I had been banned from interviews after doing a couple of interviews that the record label disapproved of and so Eileen and I went away for a few days.
'First Barcelona then straight onto New York. All I remember was I was at the airport when we heard the terrible news. For me, 10 years ago brings back bad memories of media manipulation, lies and public humiliation. I totally missed the news about 7/7.
'Today I used my 140 characters on twitter to say that. Anyone who has read my book knows I didn't celebrate my single or album success. So the comments that it was some kind of "humblebrag" are totally false - it was sarcasm.
'It comes as no surprise that the media that ignored my book and my revelations about tabloid media, Max Clifford, historic abuse and bullying have all jumped on this tweet.
'Obviously, my troubles don't compare to those who have lost a loved one in London on July 7th 2005, but this does't stop people with an agenda trying to twist it to continue the vilification that I've endured since falling out with Cowell in 2005.
'My book was pretty much ignored last year and still went to number one on kindle and yet the press pick up on a tweet. Work it out for yourself,' he wrote.
Despite his protestations, his comments were slammed as 'insensitive' by scores of followers.
'And you wonder why you are a flop? RIP 7/7 victims, they will remain in our memories,' said one while another outraged: 'Steve Brookstein disgusts me!!!'.
Brookstein did not respond to MailOnline's repeated requests for comment this afternoon.
Thousands of Twitter users earlier took to the micro-blogging site to share photographs of their commute to work having stepped off public transport one stop early to walk the remainder in memory of those killed ten years ago.
They accompanied their touching tributes with the hashtag #walktogether and shared images of commuters holding hands, their feet and floral tributes left across London.
Meanwhile members of the royal family and the Prime Minister came together for a moment's silence at St Paul's after laying wreaths in memory of the tragedy's victims. 
Excuse: Later the failed singer posted a lengthier message on his Facebook account to explain his comments

	Adolf Hitler's holiday retreat for Nazis Prora opening as a luxury resort

	Prora was built by Hitler between 1936 and 1939 to be a 'Baltic Butlins,' but plans halted as attention went on the war effort. Over 57 luxury flats have been sold ahead of the October opening.

Metropole's Manfred Hartwig, said: 'The past is the past. Prora may have been built by the Nazis , but it was never used by them or their soldiers.
'Now the place is so lovely, visitors want to get back to nature and enjoy its beauty.'
The construction was part of a programme introduced by Hitler, called Kraft durch Freude - meaning 'strength through joy'.
As part of this, Hitler arranged for there to be activities such as skiing and cruises - and intended to build a collection of seaside resorts on Rgen.
It was  planned to be the biggest holiday camp in the world, occupying over three miles of beach front, and the aim was to provide a bucket-and-spade resort for 20,000 families from Hitlers master race.
Condos can be bought for between 125,000 and 900,000, for those who want a permanent plot of Prora
57 flats of the transformed apartments have already been snapped up by buyers
Berlin firm Metropole has exclusive rights to the unusual holiday destination and hope to stress that the past is the past

There were eight identical buildings erected, offering entertainment, catered meals and organised fun based around Nazi propaganda, and it even won an award in 1937 for its Bauhaus design.
With the onset of war, the intended holiday haven held an entirely different function.
Nazis used the buildings to house workers and to provide accommodation to refugees.
Over time the giant resort fell into disrepair, and was only saved from demolition by being given landmark status.

The Soviets considered blowing it up, but it was discovered they didn't have enough dynamite for the job, so it became a massive tank-and-artillery base for the People's Army of East Germany and it vanished from all maps.
It is hoped that despite its history, the holiday homes will be sought after, and 57 flats have already been snapped up.
The grand opening is scheduled for October with the first full-time tenants already moving in to the  Colossus of Ruegen.
Estate agent Kathrin Lange, told German press, the buildings are for 'risk-tolerant investors'.

	This is how Princess Eugenie (photoshopped) may have looked for her glamorous and bizarre Disney-themed 25th birthday party at Royal Lodge at Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.

        <MainBody>Prince Andrew sings 'Happy Birthday' to Princess Eugenie
MODEL GUEST
Guests  there were around 200  started to arrive at 6.30pm. Jet-setting model Cara Delevingne, while failing to fully embrace the dress code  by the end of the party her only nod to fancy dress was a pair of mouse ears and a mask  was on particularly exuberant form.
According to a guest, she chatted, danced and mingled with other party-goers and was to be heard 'saying how she wants to be seen as Meryl Streep rather than a model '
News that she is dating a woman  American singer/songwriter St Vincent, whose real name is Annie Clarke  didn't deter prospective male suitors who tried to chat her up.
Stars: The host of celebrities to attend the glamorous and bizarre event at Royal Lodge included Melinda Messenger
Mad hatters: British actress Donna Air (left) and the Duchess of Cambridge's brother James Middleton (right) shared an Alice in Wonderland-themed selfie
IT'S A ROYAL DRESS UP...
Contrary to reports, Fergie was not dressed as Jessica Rabbit but came as Dorothy from The Wizard Of Oz.
At 55, Prince Andrew squeezed himself into costume as Prince Charming, while Prince Harry revealed his ignorance of the Disney oeuvre, opting to go as Nintendo character Super Mario instead.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, flame-haired Princess Beatrice chose The Little Mermaid, her favourite Disney character. No one else went as Snow White, because strict instructions had been sent out that the role was reserved for Eugenie.
...PLUS FRIENDS OLD AND NEW
Not all the guests were royal. Former Page Three girl Melinda Messenger, whose boyfriend Warren Smith taught Beatrice to ski, was dressed as a sexy Tinker Bell  and posted a picture on social media of the night.
Also there was Guy Pelly (in furry animal onesie) and his wife, the Texan Holiday Inn heiress Lizzie.
Assorted Bransons, including Holly and sister-in-law Isabella, were also present, as well as James Middleton and Donna Air, who posted a picture of themselves on picture-sharing website Instagram as Alice In Wonderland characters the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts.
George Frost, son of the late Sir David, came as the blue genie from Aladdin, while Chloe Delevingne, sister of Cara, dressed as the Angelina Jolie character Maleficent  as a picture posted on social media by a fellow party-goer proved.
Magical: George Frost (pictured), son of the late Sir David, came as the blue genie from Aladdin
Nor were old friendships forgotten, with chums from Eugenie's school days at St George's Ascot and Marlborough College, plus former students of Newcastle University.
A large contingent of her parents' friends  including Fergie's old flame Paddy McNally  made up the numbers. In Eugenie's eyes, though, the most VIP guest was her long-term boyfriend Jack Brooksbank, 29, who runs restaurants and nightclubs.
He now lives in Battersea, South London, and is popular with the Yorks, who, it is said, would love him to propose.
PASSPORT CONTROL
Guests were asked to bring their own passport to prove identity as well as the party invite   mocked up to look like the real thing  to gain admittance.
Exclusive: Guests were asked to bring their passports as well as a special invitation which looked like one (pictured)
FERGIE FOOD
At the last minute, it was decided that it should be a buffet rather than a sit-down dinner. There were salads, pasta, salmon, kedgeree  all with a nod to Fergie's healthy eating craze. There was an 'enormous' chocolate cake for the birthday girl  with 25 candles  and everyone belted out 'Happy Birthday'.
GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT
There was Champagne and wine aplenty, but most of the younger guests 'went for vodka, lime and soda or Jack Daniels and coke', just as they would in Mahiki, or Boujis, or Tonteria  or any of the other trendy London clubs this young royal set like to drink in.
The party was held in seven interlinked circus-style tents, inside which were cocktail bars and a cushion-filled chill-out zone.
EUGENIE AND HER CHEEKY DWARFS
Eugenie arrived with seven dwarfs in costume.
Hired from Cheeky Events, a Chigwell based agency, they charge from 100 each per hour.
The Princess made sure she danced with each of them, while friends who wanted to dance with them had to ask her permission because they were her retinue. Wherever Snow White went, her seven dwarfs dutifully followed.
Expensive: Eugenie arrived with seven dwarfs (pictured) who were hired from Cheeky Events and charge 100 each an hour
RAP VS MOTOWN
Entertainment took the form of a live act and a DJ in a booth.
The music was described as 'middle-of-the-road chart hits and lots of R&amp;B and rap' by one guest. Chart hits eventually gave way to Motown tunes to lure the older guests onto the dance floor  and it worked.
Many younger guests changed into clubbing gear at 1am.
NO SPEECHES
If there were any speeches, they were made in private beforehand and not at the actual party.
OH DEAR, DON'T TELL GRANNY
It was definitely crazy cartoon fun, and not entirely classy.
According to one attendee: 'Some guests threw up outside in the grounds. It became extremely raucous by about 2am, with people literally falling over drunk.
'One couple were caught heavy petting.'
Crazy: With 'some guests threw up outside in the grounds', it is probably a good thing that the Queen (pictured) was not present at the raucous affair
LOVESICK HARRY
Harry seemed smitten by Cressida Bonas, who was, says a guest, 'dressed possibly as Cinderella, in a frayed hem dress  but no broom or anything'.
According to onlookers, he ignored the attentions of other girls who approached him.
Fergie, meanwhile, was accompanied by Manuel Fernandez, the Spanish internet entrepreneur who is her new companion. Andrew  though dressed for love as Prince Charming  seemed quite alone, with no woman on his arm.
STAR NO-SHOWS
Some of Prince Andrew's social set apparently didn't make the cut, perhaps indicating that it was Fergie who was firmly in charge.
'The invitations were all sent out madly late, as in the last couple of weeks,' said one guest.
'Although in theory Ascot week was a good thought because the garden is at its best and so many people are in London anyway, many of those invited were already engaged.'
Those on the guest list who were already pre-booked turned out to be largely famous friends of Fergie's. Joan Collins, Kate Moss, Shirley Bassey, Naomi Campbell and Elton John were all asked but most didn't make it.
Elton forsook the delights of Disney at Windsor to play on tour in Aberdeen.
No show: Among the superstars who could not make the event was Sarah Ferguson's good friend Kate Moss (pictured)
Busy: Supermodel Naomi Campbell (pictured) was also asked to come but had prior engagements
FIREWORK FIZZLE
The party, according to one guest, was not quite what Fergie had first envisaged. 'Talk of fireworks was shelved after it was realised the ones they wanted  the go-on-for-hours, accompanied by music variety  were going to be way too expensive. They decided it was better to have none at all rather than a cheaper, quicker display.'
ON THE BUSES
Many of the guests were coached in from London  but at 2 am Fergie 'sent the coaches away so guests could stay until 5 am'.

Never having to check your available funds came top of the list of wealth indicators, followed by having a swimming pool in your house.
Owning a boat and having a housekeeper also featured high in the list - as did sending your children to private school and having a second property.
Being able to spend more than 500 on one item of clothing is another trait, while flying business class is also considered to make you rich.
The survey also found just six per cent described themselves as rich in terms of wealth, while 60 per cent consider themselves to be rich in non-material ways, such as having healthy children and a close loving family.
Cheers: Drinking champagne is another factor that on the Rich List - of 38 reasons - that make you wealthy
Holidays: Going skiing more than once a year was also said to be a sign that you are affluent, researchers said
Less than half of those asked said they aspired to one day be wealthy, while 56 per cent had no such ambition.
This was despite the 37 per cent of the panel claiming to have at least one friend they consider to be rich and 27 per cent being envious of those who are.
And asked whether they believed money would make them happy, just 17 per cent agreed and over half answered 'possibly'.
The study also found many of us feel more able to warm to someone who has worked hard to earn their money, than someone who was born with a silver spoon in their mouth.
Vix Leyton, for  Quidco which commissioned the research, said: 'It's great to see that the majority of us feel rich in non-material ways proving that the finer things in life aren't always the things you can buy.'
ARE YOU RICH? THE LIST OF 38 REASONS THAT MEAN YOU ARE WEALTHY...

1. Never have to check your 'available funds'
2. Have a swimming pool in your house
3. Own a boat
5. Send your children to private school

	A female teacher 'seducing' a boy isn't just a laugh says RACHEL JOHNSON

	The trial of former headmistress Anne Lakey  made me see how blinkered my attitude that only men pose a sexual threat to children was blinkered, by RACHEL JOHNSON.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
This is because we are also conditioned to see the mature woman as the nurturer. We have something called mother expectation: a child left alone with a woman will be safe, but one left alone with a man might be at risk.
(Even though if you interpret the NCA research another way, 97 per cent of men have not the faintest desire to harm children in any way.) But the notion that a woman alone and of her own accord can abuse a child messes with the myth of male power and the patriarchy, and therefore some feminists  for whom everything is the fault of nasty horrid men  dont like it.
Even known female sex offenders  Rose West or Myra Hindley  are assumed to have been to some extent acting out the desires of a dominant male, like Fred West (who some say was abused by his own mother Daisy from the age of 12) or Ian Brady. Michelle Elliott, founder of Kidscape, says that a rare conference on female sexual offenders she attended was disrupted by angry feminazis, who shouted down participants who dared discuss the topic on stage.
But after Lakey, we simply cant escape the knowledge that a female child abuser is drawn to schools, to teaching, to childcare, just as male child abusers are, and just as an alcoholic cant stay away from pubs and clubs. Like Anne Lakey, they can often operate undercover, undetected, confident that either neo-Victorian feminists dont believe women can be child-sex predators, or that people secretly agree with Greer, who once said a boys erection implies consent. (Im a fan of Greer, but this statement is tantamount to saying that a girl who involuntarily orgasms during rape enjoys it.)
The judges sentencing of Lakey to eight years jail is exemplary for good reason.
Whether the wimmin of Britain like it or not, whats sauce for the gander must also be sauce for the goose.
A hint of 'mum tum' might make you smile too, Amal
After I had my daughter I was still wearing tents from what was then Evans Outsize nine months later.
People would ask when the baby was due. Zara Tindall doesnt appear to care about her mum tum, either  certainly not enough to invest in a pair of Spanx, anyway.
Its far more reassuring to see a beautiful woman waxing than waning away, like Amal Clooney, who turned up at Westminster with withers skinnier than an Ascot thoroughbred.
And if it turns out Zara does have a bun in the oven after all, jollier still.

Killed by too much kindness
Carl Thompson, Britains fattest man, is dead
Carl Thompson, Britains fattest man, is dead. He ate 10,000 calories a day, dining on Chinese food, curries, and pizzas that he ordered online.
Immobile, he lived off disability allowance and had NHS carers who did his lunches.
His carers sound like lovely people and were clearly very fond of him. But as I listened to one reminisce on the radio about his favourite lunch of sausage, beans and chips, I couldnt help thinking that the State did not help Carl. In fact it was his  in therapy-speak  enabler.
He knew, and said, he had to lose 45 stone or he would die. He knew and said what he needed was a dietitian and shrink. Instead he was provided with a series of suppliers.
Im not saying his death was state-sponsored euthanasia, but it comes pretty close.

Gym weights aren't the real enemy
The sheriffs of California have taken on face value the ironic hip-hop lyric that says: Guns dont kill people, rappers do.
They charged Diddy (aka rapper Sean Combs) with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon after he grabbed a kettlebell gym weight in anger. I do wish US law enforcement would come down as hard on gun-owners as they do on rappers.
Its not long since Dylann Roof, 21, mowed down nine black worshippers in Charleston using a legal firearm.
The deadly weapons infesting America are not kettlebells, or even medicine balls. They are guns. In the US, people are killed with firearms at 297 times the rate of Japan and 49 times the rate of France.
There are 88 guns per 100 people in the US, the highest in the world. If Obama leaves office having done one decent thing, he will repeal the Second Amendment enshrining the right to bear arms. The Presidencys failure to do anything about the millions of deadly weapons in the Land of the Gun is a national tragedy.

	Syed Choudhury, a student in Cardiff whose family are from Bradford, trawled the internet for terrorist material and told friends he 'would do anything' to get to Syria and fight for the jihadi group

She said: 'He was heard to say that all gay people should be killed and they would go to hell.
'On another occasion, the group were asked to produce a poster about any topic they chose in order to demonstrate their IT skills
'Mr Choudhury produced a poster with an image of a Muslim demonstration on it with a banner reading 'Islam will dominate the world, freedom can go to hell' written on it.'
He went to a protest with a banner proclaiming: 'Islamic State will bring peace to the Middle East'
Choudhury left the course in May 2013 with some qualifications and it is believed he spent some time in Bangladesh.
He downloaded Islamic State propaganda images on his phone in February last year, and turned up to a Gaza demonstration in July 2014 carrying a banner proclaiming: 'Islamic State will bring peace to the Middle East'.
Choudhury then turned his attention to trying to fly to Syria, via Turkey, to join ISIS fighters.
Sharing his plans with a friend on Twitter, he complained: 'Now we got Islamic country but we can't go but if we get caught then your arrested for life.'
Choudhury planned to use funds from his part-time jobs at a takeaway to fund the trip.
He also told his friend: 'If you want something nice over there better than AK it's up to you [a reference to an AK47 rifle].'
The court heard he had no contacts in the area, which is controlled by the extremist jihadis (file photo)
He posted on social media: 'I would love to go there [Syria] I love it' and later confessed: 'My heart is pulling me to Syria'.
When arrested, Choudhury told police the only reason he hadn't made it to Syria was because he had not found anyone to go with him.
Abdul Iqbal QC, defending, told the court: 'Naivety, immaturity, and lack of insight are the hallmarks of his character.
'He had no direct link with anyone in the area of Turkey or Syria, the enquiries seemed to be on the internet 'do you know, could you help'.
'They were enquiries by an individual showing enthusiasm for traveling to Syria via Turkey, but he had got no further than making enquiries and had not himself made any independent enquiries beyond those made on the Internet.'

	Jessica Mann and then-boyfriend Aaron Rigby were forced to seek medical attention for painful rashes and blisters that broke out all over their bodies while on holiday in the Dominican Republic.

And now I have no choice but to live with my condition which seems to have been made worse by the holiday. It is immensely frustrating.
It was supposed to be a memorable break but looking back now, I just wish we'd never gone.
Aaron, a 34-year-old insulation engineer, received medication from a doctor at the resort and both sought medical treatment at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport when they returned home.
They were prescribed painkillers, steroids and creams for the large, irritable red blisters which burst.

The pair hired lawyers from the firm of Irwin Mitchell, which secured payouts from Thomas Cook despite the firm denying liability.
The holidaymakers requested that the settlement amount remain confidential.
A Thomas Cook spokesperson told MailOnline Travel the tour operator takes health and hygiene issues very seriously.
The spokesperson added: We were sorry to hear about Ms Mann and Mr Rigbys experience while on holiday at the Sirenis Cocotal in the Dominican Republic in 2011.
Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the highest health and hygiene standards are maintained. We can confirm that the Sirenis Cocotal no longer features in our holiday programme.
It is never our intention to disappoint our customers. We are happy to say this matter has now been resolved to Ms Mann and Mr Rigbys satisfaction, and that we have reached an agreement with their legal representatives.

Jessica said nothing can change what happened and she just wants to put the ordeal behind her and move on.
It was not just the rash that spoiled the holiday, there were lots of other things wrong with the hotel.
There were lots of insects in our hotel room and the fridge and lights in our first hotel room were not working properly.
When Aaron and I complained to both the Thomas Cook representative and the staff at the hotel they did not seem to take our complaints very seriously and at times it felt like I was spending more time complaining than I was enjoying the holiday.
Thomas Cook said theSirenis Cocotal Beach Resort no longer features in its holiday programme
Jessica said a Thomas Cook representative and hotel staff did not seem to take her complaints seriously
Jessica said the holiday turned out to be a 'very frightening experience' and she couldn't wait to go home
Clare Pearson, from Irwin Mitchell, said: This is a terrible situation in which our clients have developed extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing conditions during what was meant to be a relaxing holiday.
Sadly such cases are not uncommon and while nothing can be done to reverse the problems Jessica and Aaron have faced.
We hope that the settlements will go some way towards helping them to take steps to put these issues behind them.
Their story is an important reminder that everything possible should be done to ensure the safety of holidaymakers always comes first.
DON'T LET THE BED BUGS BITE
Bed bugs surface at night and feast on human blood
High on the list of holidaymakers biggest fears, bed bugs feast on the blood of humans and hide in cracks and crevices in and around beds.
They surface at night and bite exposed skin, leaving itchy red bumps that appear within 30 minutes and can last for days, or fluid-filled blisters.
Bed bugs are oval-shaped, flat and visible to the naked eye, with their colour varying between dark yellow, red or brown.
Bites usually occur to the face, neck, hands or arms, are often mistaken for mosquito bites and typically occur in straight lines.
Many people dont suffer a reaction or only have the odd spot, but those who develop itchy bumps should see their GP for treatment.
Other signs that bed bug are present include black spots on a mattress, which could be the bugs dried faeces, blood spots from a bug that has been squashed in the night, and mottled shells that the insects may have shed.
An infestation may bring with it an unpleasant, musty scent that is produced by adult bed bugs.
The good news, according to health experts, is bed bugs arent dangerous and dont transmit any human diseases.
But people should call their local council or a professional pest control firm to prevent the spread of an infestation, as the tiny insects can spread easily from room to room or building to building by crawling or being transported in luggage, clothing, furniture or bedding.
That makes it easier for them to hitch a ride into holidaymakers' homes.
Females lay up to 300 eggs over their lifetime, and they hatch about 10 days later to form tiny straw-coloured insects which grow into adults within six to eight weeks.
As the insects are not attracted to dirt, a bed bug infestation isnt a sign of an unclean home. They are more common in hotels or hostels.

        <MainBody>Lieutenant Norman Harry Poole the first British soldier to set foot in France on D-Day, aged 95
The first British soldier to land in occupied France during the D-Day operation has died, aged 95.
SAS paratrooper Lieutenant Norman Poolewas one of a six-man team who landed on the Cherbourg peninsula in Normandy on the night of June 5-6, 1944, in an operation codenamed Titanic IV.
The soldier, who leapt from a plane with a carrier pigeon strapped to his chest, landed with 200 dummy parachutists and were tasked with the job of distracting German troops with amplifiers playing fake combat noises.
His pigeon was the only one that got home with a vital message for military chiefs - but he never told anyone what that message was and has now gone to his grave with the secret.
By the end of June 6 over 155,000 Allied troops had established bases along the Normandy coast and paved the way to eventual victory over Hitler's Germany.
Lt Poole and his team were separated from the other troops and they spent six weeks behind enemy lines before being captured by German troops.
The group were eventually liberated by the Americans and Norman was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery.
But Lt Poole, who after the war became a banker for Natwest, was reluctant to talk about his place in the historic invasion, even with his family.
He lived in Portishead, Somerset, with his wife Elisabeth and retired in 1980.Norman died in June - four years after Elisabeth.
The couple had two daughters, Elisabeth and Alison, and four grandchildren and five great grandchildren.

	The retailer said its general merchandise - which is mostly clothes - sales fell 0.4 per cent in the three months to June, although its better than last year when notched up a 1.5 per cent decline.

Some have questioned whether M&amp;S can ever get its clothes sales back on track.
Richard Hunter, at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The elephant in the changing room remains, in the form of General Merchandise. Whether M&amp;S can ever return to former glories by enticing clothes shoppers back to its stores is arguably its largest challenge, even though the more recent experience implies at least a stabilisation of previously dropping numbers.'
Grilling: Marks &amp; Spencer boss Marc Bolland faces a tough time at Wembley Stadium today
As ever Marks &amp; Spencer food arm has proved its strongest asset.
The group's food like-for-like sales lifted 0.3 per cent during the period.
The retailer, which launched 700 new food lines during the period, continues to see its high-end items outperform the grocery market, which is locked in a supermarket price war.
Yesterday Marks &amp; Spencer announced that it will start rolling out free in-store collection at more than 100 of its Simply Food outlets.
The first new collection points will include Simply Food stores at King's Cross, Manchester Piccadilly and Cardiff Central railway stations.
The move sees Marks &amp; Spencer outfox rival John Lewis, which said it would start charging customers 2 to collect online orders in store, citing 'unsustainable' and 'bonkers' web-based business models.
It also comes after Marks &amp; Spencer reported a boost to online, with sales via the website up 38.7 per cent, after the 131-year old retailer invested and overhauled the site.
Chief executive, Marc Bolland, said: 'We continue to make progress against our key priorities. Our food business did very well in a difficult market. In general merchandise, sales were broadly level on last year and we are on track to deliver the planned increase in gross margin.'
The group also said it will launch a 150million share buyback programme for investors, which is due to begin on July 8.
Shareholders have gathered at the group's annual meeting at Wembley Stadium in London today.
Shares in Marks &amp; Spencer were up 1 per cent, or 4.0p, at 551.0p ahead of the meeting.
In May, the firm reported underlying profits for the year to March 28 rose 6.1 per cent to 661.2million, easing some of the intense pressure Bolland has been under in recent years.
Bolland took over at M&amp;S in 2010 and during his tenure he has seen rival Next overtake his business.

Ms Wilks said: 'He was side-stepping along the girder when one of the stones hit the shoulder strap of his rucksack. He fell on to the rocks below, where he sustained very serious injuries.'
The defendants checked if Mr Davies was okay before fleeing the scene, it was said.
The court heard police officers arrested a 15-year-old  later that afternoon.
The court heard Mr Davies (pictured in hospital) and his friend began to climb along the metal girders to avoid the stones, but the defendants crossed to the other side of the river and continued pelting them with rocks
Mr Davies fell off  the bridge (pictured above) and plummeted towards the rocky riverbed, the court heard
In an interview, he said he and his friends were throwing stones in an attempt to 'startle' the boys and claimed Mr Davies did not fall until several minutes after they had stopped throwing stones.
He admitted throwing five or six stones, but said he was not aiming at Joshua.
Two other teenagers, aged 16 and 18, were arrested later that evening.
The 16-year-old denied throwing any stones and said he did not know how Joshua had fallen. He claimed he had left the scene because he was 'shocked' after Joshua said he could not feel his legs.
Kurtis Lawrence admitted throwing two or three stones, but claimed he was aiming them at the wall. He reported hearing 'screaming and shouting' as he fell.

The court heard Joshua was taken to the University Hospital of Wales.
Ms Wilks said: 'It is fair to say he suffered catastrophic injuries.'
She told the jury he suffered trauma to his spine and fractures to his wrist and arm. 'Despite months of rehabilitation, he remains paralysed in a wheelchair,' she added.
Ms Wilks said: 'It is the prosecution case that all three pursued him and all three deliberately threw stones at him. They intended to hit him with the stones.
'It would have been obvious to them that there was a very real risk he would fall and that would result in serious injury.'
The trial continues.

	Mykal Porter, 22, collapsed and died while football training, six days after medics at Rotherham Hospital, Yorkshire, failed to tell him he needed emergency treatment for a blood clot in his chest.

Dr Bardsley told the inquest he believed Mr Porter would probably still be alive if he had looked at the scan on the day it was performed and called him back into hospital.
He admitted he would have acted immediately if he had looked at the scan, but said he was under pressure to perform ward rounds.
During the hearing Dr Bardsley accepted that looking at the scan was a 'two minute job' and could have been performed on virtually any computer.
'I've reflected on this so many times over the last few months,' Dr Bardsley told the hearing.
'There were opportunities, and I wasn't helped by circumstances, but certainly several opportunities fell at my door and I didn't take them. I feel I should have.'

Mr Porter was the player manager of Barnsley Sunday League teamCarlton Athletic. Pictured: Mr Porter is in the back row wearing the black jumper.

After Dr Bardsley looked at the scan he asked a secretary to contact Mr Porter and get him to hospital.
The medic assumed his patient had got this message, but after learning, the following day, Mr Porter had not been in touch, he had a a letter faxed to his GP.
But it was not marked 'urgent' and was treated as 'routine mail' by the surgery.
Mr Porter's GP did not read it until after his death.
Dr Bardsley said he had referred himself to the General Medical Council and was awaiting their verdict, saying it had completely devastated him.
'Will I return to work after this? I doubt it. It has affected me very deeply,' he said.
Recording a narrative verdict, assistant Sheffield coroner Louise Slater said 'there were a number of missed opportunities to recognise the urgency of the situation and the importance of contact with Mr Porter.'
She continued: 'On the balance of probabilities had Mr Porter been contacted and appropriate treatment commenced in a timely manner it is likely his death would have been avoided.'
After the verdict, Mr Porter's father, Norman, 57, said: 'I'm glad it's been officially recorded, what we already knew, that Mykal should still be here. I can't say it any plainer than that.'
Tracey McErlain-Burns, chief nurse at Rotherham Hospital said afterwards: 'On behalf of the Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust I apologise for the failures in care and express sincere condolences to Mr Porter's family.'

	Police said Mark Smith, 42, and Rachel Cooper, 38, of Loughton, Essex, were so hard on the eye that victims with severe memory impairments were able to pick them out of an ID parade.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
'That's one of the reasons we were able to pick them up.
'The elderly victims - even though some had Alzheimer's - were able to describe them as their physical appearance, looking as they do, made them stick in the minds of their victims.
'One recognised Smith in an ID parade - she was in her 90s and managed to pick him out because of his distinctive looks.'
The pair, of Loughton, Essex, tricked their way into the homes of victims aged 70-94 by telling them they needed money to take a sick relative to hospital.
Sentenced: The pair were jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured), Smith for eight years and Cooper for two years and nine months, after stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds from elderly victims
They targeted a 94-year-old woman with Alzheimer's on three occasions, stealing 5,000 cash and 2,000 jewellery from her home in Loughton.
Smith and Cooper were jailed for a total of 13 offences across Essex, London and Kent between July and November 2014.
Smith was arrested in September that year after attempting the scam on a man in Brentwood, Essex, who called officers and positively identified him.
They weren't the best looking, that's putting it mildly
Detective Sergeant Brett Hagen
Cooper was arrested in November 2014 after she was caught using a 91-year-old man's bank card in the moments after she stole it, having pushed him to the ground during a burglary in Woodford Green, north east London.
Det Sgt Hagenadded: 'Distraction burglary is a disgraceful crime and Smith and Cooper represent every elderly person's worst nightmare.
'They conned their way into addresses with brazen and concocted stories, specifically targeting vulnerable victims.
'We hope to see more come forward. There are probably tens if not hundreds more that have fallen foul to these two.'
Smith and Cooper were both found guilty of the distraction burglaries at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

	Critics said it meant the British people will have to accept a 'post-dated cheque' because any reforms Mr Cameron achieves could be reversed later before being written into a treaty.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Voters in Britain's referendum on leaving the European Union will not know for certain that David Cameron has got a better deal, it has emerged.
The Prime Minister claimed he was 'delighted' after raising his reforms at a dinner last night but he has been told he will not be able to change the EU's complex treaties before his planned in-out vote by the end of 2017.
Critics said it meant the British people will have to accept a 'post-dated cheque' because any reforms Mr Cameron achieves could be unpicked by other countries before being written into a new treaty.
David Cameron, pictured arriving at the summit in Brussels today, has declared himself 'delighted' to have kicked off the formal renegotiation process which will pave the way for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union
Mr Cameron was seen deep in conversation withLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on the second day of the EU summit today
WHAT ARE CAMERON'S KEY DEMANDS FOR EU REFORM?
FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:
No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years
No social housing for four years
No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK
FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:
No support from the UK taxpayer
Deportation if they do not get a job for six months
OTHER IMMIGRATION MEASURES:
Restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU
Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK
Tougher rules on deporting foreign criminals
Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels
PROTECTIONS FROM EU INTERFERENCE:
A special 'opt-out' from the principle of 'ever closer union' between EU states
Measures to strengthen national parliaments to club together to block Brussels diktats
Rules to protect the influence of countries outside the Eurozone
The Conservative government has pledged to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum on whether to accept the new deal or go it alone.
Mr Cameron had demanded 'proper, full-on treaty change' to ensure his promised reforms could not be reversed.
But with some EU leaders it could take 10 years to negotiate a new treaty which some countries would have to put to a referendum, Downing Street now accepts it will not happen before 2017.
The Prime Minister is now saying he would accept an 'irreversible lock' or a 'legally binding' guarantee that EU law will be changed at some future point to accommodate Britain's renegotiation.
Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland are all expected to hold their own referendums to approve any change to the EU's treaties.
Labour accused the Prime Minister of retreating in the face of opposition from other EU states.
Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said: 'All year the Prime Minister has been saying that change to the treaty was a definite requirement and yet now, faced with entirely predictable opposition from other member states, he is signalling retreat while pretending that all he ever wanted was a post-dated cheque.'
Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'It sounds like a post-dated cheque. There are so many big things happening that a promissory note of some kind to Britain may well finish up not being honoured.
'Post-dated cheques can bounce and one suspects that any post-dated cheque that was given to the Brits would be given by presidents and prime ministers in office now.
'By the time it came to be honoured there would be different prime ministers and presidents elected on a ticket saying we won't honour this note. It doesn't work any way you look at it.'
Key demands include curbing access to benefits for migrants, ending the concept of 'ever closer union', giving national governments the power to veto Brussels diktats and securing protection for the interests of EU members, like the UK, which do not use the euro.
After defying the polls to secure an overall Conservative majority in May's election, Mr Cameron believes he has a mandate to deliver serious reform.
In a boost for his plans, the issue was on the EU agenda for the first time last night.
But Mr Cameron spoke for around 10 minutes during a working dinner dominated by bitter rows over which EU countries would take thousands of migrants from north Africa.

The images are sent to a 3D printer which creates the final likeness, layer-by-layer, from plastic resin.
Hannah Bramley, 27, is 35 weeks pregnant with her third child, a daughter, and chose to have a sculpture made by Wolfprint after having a detailed scan at a local clinic, Miracle in Progress, in Loughborough, Leicestershire. She paid 80 for the private 3D scan when she was 28 weeks pregnant, and a further 150 for the sculpture to be made  but says it was money well spent.
Emotional: Midwife Jo Proud poses with Hannah Bramley and her sculpture which she says has brought her closer to her unborn daughter
The ultrasound scan that 3D prints unborn baby sculptures
She said: I cried when I saw it for the first time. I had 3D scans done with both of my older boys but this was totally different. Its impossible to explain. You can touch it. My sister thought it was freaky, but I think its amazing. It feels like shes already here. Its strange, but I do probably feel closer to her than I did to my other babies when I was pregnant.
Joanna Proud of Miracle in Progress, added: Every mother likes to feel an extra bond with their unborn child.
Dr Bryan Beattie offers the service at Innermost Healthcare in Cardiff. He said: What you see is a little person who you can relate to, rather than a black and white image which you know is a foetus but could be anyones. The cost is still high because the technology is so new but were hoping it will come down as more people sign up. It could prove helpful for people expecting babies with facial deformities such as cleft lip, and even surgeons planning corrective operations after birth.
Technology: The sculpture is created from images of a 3D scan (seen above on an ultrasound monitor)
Standard NHS scans are generally only 2D and the image quality is poor because they are designed to see through the babys skin to view the internal organs.
But private clinics spend longer using standard ultrasound to take lots of two-dimensional slices which are put together to create a 3D effect. They also appear clearer because the organs are not shown.
The Health Protection Agency has warned women against so-called souvenir scans because of potential risks to the unborn baby, as they require longer and more intense exposure to ultrasound, the effects of which are untested
Kaspar Tiri of Wolfprint 3D, said: We were a company producing 3D models for architects and the construction industry and then a friends wife got pregnant, so we thought, why cant we create 3D models of the babies?
The reaction so far has been amazing. For a parent to not only see but touch their childs face before it is born is very special.

	The United Nations called on Britain to accept its share of thousands of people from North Africa, after a Brussels dinner was dominated by arguments over where the migrants should settle.

Peter Sutherland, special representative of the UN secretary-general for international migration and development, said it was wrong for some countries to turn their back on the plan.
Hetold BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'All member states should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark.
'This is a question basically of European solidarity. Why should Greece and particularly Italy take this unfair burden of responsibility for people who are refugees escaping from persecution?'
All member states should participate in the voluntary settlement, including Britain, Ireland and Denmark
Peter Sutherland, United Nations
He said providing ships to rescue migrants found at sea was 'not enough'.
Leaders have agreed to relocate 40,000 migrants from Italy and Greece to other EU countries over the next two years, in an effort to share the burden of a growing crisis.
They also agreed to resettle another 20,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq.
Italy wanted a quota system to be created to fix numbers of migrants to be sent to each country, but after facing criticism from other countries plan will now be voluntary.
A working dinner in Brussels continued into the small hours of this morning as leaders failed to agree on how to tackle the crisis.
Mr Renzi turned onHungary, Poland and Lithuania, whose leaders say they won't be forced to take any.
He told them: 'If you don't agree on 40,000, you aren't worthy of calling yourselves Europe'.
In what was described by diplomatic sources as an 'emotional' outburst, he then said pointedly: 'If that's your idea of Europe, you can keep it'.
David Cameron, pictured arriving at the Brussels summit today, has vowed to use a British veto to opt out of any EU-wide plan to spread 40,000 migrants across the continent
Mr Renzi has urged other EU countries to sign up to a plan to relocate migrants, but Mr Cameron has refused to accept any in the UK
Mr Cameron was seen deep in conversation withLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel on the second day of the EU summit today
Now member states will have to agree on how many asylum seekers they are willing to take by mid-July, but it will be voluntary not mandatory, much to the anger of Italy, who receive the bulk of the migrants.
Mr Renzi said afterwards the outcome of the meeting fell short of what Italy needed. 'Relocation is a first step but for us this is not the solution to our problems.'
Britain has already said it will use its veto to avoid taking any of the migrants, and around 12 other states, many from eastern Europe, are also opposed to taking a set number.
Last weekTheresa May  called for the migrants crossing the Mediterranean to be forcibly sent back to Africa as a deterrent and to show there was 'no merit' in coming to Europe.
Figures released last week revealed that 100,000 migrants have made the crossing from North Africa to southern Europe since January alone, with 57,000 landing in Italy.
European council President Donald Tusk (left) and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker denied being at odds over how to tackle the migrant crisis
An estimated 170,000 migrants reached Italy by sea last year. But only a third of them claimed asylum there, with the rest likely to have headed for northern Europe, including Britain.
EU officials last night tried to diffuse the row and claimed that the talks were a success because a total of 60,000 migrants in Italy and Greece - 40,000 who came by boat and 20,000 from Syria - would be resettled.
A European source said the EU's two top figures, European Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, had clashed at the meeting but the two rejected the suggestion.
'Don't believe those who are tweeting, leaking info. Whenever we have difficulties, we discuss these things between ourselves,' Mr Juncker said at a press conference.
Britain has used its veto avoid taking migrants directly andTheresa May has demanded that they be forcibly sent back to Africa
Around 60,000 people have arrived in Europe from north Africa so far this year, while 2,000 are estimated to have died while making the dangerous journey
Royal Navy rescue 369 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea
Mr Juncker insisted that what really mattered was that EU leaders had approved the numbers of asylum seekers to be resettled as proposed by the Commission.
'I don't care if it is to be done voluntarily or not because the most important thing was that we agreed on the 60,000,' he said.
MrTusk, a former Polish premier whose country opposes the quota system, said 'migrants with no legal right to enter the EU will be returned' and negotiations with countries of origin would be speeded up to take them.
He has insisted that with 'no consensus' on quotas, EU member states should instead make realistic voluntary offers of refuge to deal with the upsurge in migrants.
'The voluntary scheme cannot be an excuse to do nothing. I can understand those who want this voluntary mechanism but they will only be credible if they give precise and significant pledges by the end of July at the latest,' he said.
'Solidarity without sacrifice is pure hypocrisy. Now we don't need empty declarations on solidarity, only deeds and numbers,' Mr Tusk added.
Stand-off: David Cameron speaks to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban last night, one of the men that Matteo Menzi, front right, became irate with last night
Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz and Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite were also said to have been rebuked by the Italians
Last night David Cameron declared himself 'delighted' after he used the dinner to kick off the formal renegotiation process which will pave the way for an in/out referendum.
Mr Cameron secured agreement for 'technical' talks between UK and EU officials over the next six months on British concerns including restricting welfare for EU migrants, an opt-out from the goal of 'ever-closer union' in Europe, greater powers for national parliaments and protections for countries - like the UK - which are not members of the single currency.
Speaking as he left the talks at around 2.45am, Mr Cameron said: 'I am delighted that the process of British reform and renegotiation and the referendum we are going to hold - that process is now properly under way.
'People always say to me these things aren't possible, we will never get them done. Once again, we have proved we will get them done. We have started that process and it's under way.'

	Mr Blair, who was PM when four British bombers blew themselves up killing 52 people in 2005, warned today that the threat posed by Islamist fanatics has reached 'the edges of Europe'.

Mr Blair warned that if the international community was not prepared to tackle extremists groups such as Islamic State head on they would continue to grow.
'When you fight these people it's going to be tough because they're prepared to kill without mercy and die without regret and that makes them an enemy that may not have the same conventional military capability but has certainly got the determination to fight.'
Pressed over whether the response should involve British boots on the ground, he said: 'This is maybe a discussion for another day.'
Tony Blair talks about the 7/7 attacks and terrorist activity
David Cameron and Boris Johnson attend a wreath laying ceremony in Hyde Park,  to mark the 10 Year anniversary of the London 7/7 Bombings
The bombings of three Tube trains and a bus - carried out by four bombers linked to al-Qaeda and carrying rucksacks of explosives - was the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil
Londoners pause for minute's silence to commemorate 7/7 victims
The former PM rejected claims the attacks had been prompted by the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan - which had themselves between a response to the September 11 terror attacks.
He said: 'I think it's very important to understand that the probable leader of the 7/7 attacks was someone who was first in a training camp in the middle of 2001, before 9/11, never mind before the invasion of Afghanistan or the invasion of Iraq and the difficulty is that there will always be reason and excuses that people use for terrorism.
'You have countries like France today that's the subject of terrorism or Norway or Belgium or Tunisia or Kuwait or countries across Africa, none of whom had anything to do with British or American foreign policy and yet whose citizens come under this type of violent and indiscriminate killing so I think in the end, the responsibility has got to lie with the people who carry this out and those who encourage them.'
An hour after the tube bombings, a fourth device was set off on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, killing 13 people
Earlier, PM David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson were among those who laid wreaths in Hyde Park.
The bombings of three Tube trains and a bus - carried out by four bombers linked to al-Qaeda and carrying rucksacks of explosives - was the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil.
At just after 8.50am on July 7, 2005, three explosions took place on the Underground - 26 people died at Russell Square, six at Edgware Road and seven at Aldgate.
Almost an hour later, a fourth device was set off on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square, killing 13 people.
The bombings were carried out by Mohammad Sidique Khan, 30, Shehzad Tanweer, 22, Hasib Hussain, 18, and Germaine Lindsay, 19. The group had links to al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Mr Blair's intervention comes after the head of MI5 Andrew Parker warned that Britain faced a 'serious societal' threat from a tiny minority of Muslims with a 'twisted' belief their own country is the enemy.
Mr Parker describes 7/7 as the moment the UK fully woke up to the threat of Al Qaeda and other Islamists.
He says a 'step change' in counter-terrorism defences, as a result of the London bombings, allowed the Security Service to foil more plots and save thousands of lives.
But, in an article for MI5's website, Mr Parker says 'appalling acts' continue to be attempted by individuals who have 'grown up here but decided for whatever twisted reasons to identify their own country as the enemy'.
He adds: 'They are a tiny fraction of the population. But the continuing fact that some people born in the UK, with all the opportunities and freedoms that modern Britain offers, can nonetheless make those sorts of warped choices presents a serious societal and security challenge.'
It follows warnings by David Cameron that some Muslim communities are 'quietly condoning' the extremist ideology that can lead to terrorism.
The Prime Minister and other dignitaries will today pay tribute to victims of the bombers who set off homemade devices on three Tube trains and a bus a decade ago, killing 52 and injuring hundreds.
Police and security officials are on high alert, with a terrorist outrage officially rated highly likely.

'I never remember her having a bad day. She was a beautiful-looking girl and so full of joy.
'It didn't matter what time of day I'd see her, first thing in the morning or last thing at night, she was so glam  and I'd turn up in T-shirts and scruffy jeans and old trainers.'
Media personality Clarke - who remains good friends with Michelle's husband Paul added: 'I'm devastated. I'm actually still shaking. My heart goes out to the family and her friends.
Michelle photographed with her boxing legend father, Jim Watt. It's the second family tragedy to befall Jim and wife Margaret, after their son Jim junior died in a car accident in 1995
'It's a really sad day and not having her smile around is a loss.
Make-up expert Craig Alexander Wilson said: 'To hear this is devastating.
'Michelle was easy to work with and a real professional who had a zest for life.
'She loved her industry, was very committed to her family and husband, and I know she was the apple of her father's eye.'
Michelle carved a successful media career after presenting a number of TV programmes, including ITV's interior design hit, 60 Minute Makeover
She was also a regular newspaper columnist, with her bubbly nature and sense of humour said to be purely contagious to those around her
It was in 2008 that Michelle finally got her big break after a decade of smaller television appearances, landing her dream job co-hosting ITV1 show 60 Minute Makeover with Terri Dwyer.
Speaking at the time, she admitted that the role brought together her two passions - TV and interior design, having become qualified following a successful stint studying at the National Design Academy.
It is believed that in recent years, while caring for her young daughter, Michelle helped out with her parents' bridal-car business, often chauffeuring. She also accepted offers to host corporate events around Scotland, and was a guest host on STV magazine series The Hour between 2009 and 2010.
Michelle's father Jim Watt became world lightweight boxing champion in April 1979 after beating Colombian Alfredo Pitalua.
Tributes have poured in for the popular TV presenter, with her showbiz friends left 'devastated' by the news
Lorraine Kelly was previously described by Michelle as her 'inspiration'. The TV favourite this morning Tweeted her shock, describing the 38-year-old as a 'lovely woman and a fantastic mum'
Songstress Michelle McManus - who won Pop Idol in 2003 and is now big in Scottish showbiz - took to Twitter to share her grief
Comedian Des Clarke co-presented dating show Club Cupid with Michelle. In a moving Tweet, he described his former colleague as 'a lovely person', before sending his wishes to her grieving family
After hanging up his gloves in 1981, he became a sports commentator for ITV.
He moved to join Sky Sports in 1996, where he continues to broadcast as both a pundit and co-commentator, commenting recently on the $200million fight between Flloyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2.

June 24, 2015 - Found dead in her home at age 38
His daughter's death comes just months before the 20th anniversary of son Jim junior's passing.
The 17-year-old died after being involved in a sickening smash in which one other man was killed on October 30, 1995.
Opening up about Jim junior's death on Radio Scotland show 'Stuff of Legends' five years ago, the Southpaw fighter described the horror his demise had brought to his and wife Margaret's lives.
He said: 'It was the lowest point of my life. You shouldn't bury your children - your children should bury you.
'That was horrendous. My wife has been left in a terrible state. She'll never get her head around it. The way I get my head around it was the way I've pretty much dealt with my whole life.
'When I was boxing there were things I had to do and things I couldn't do in order to get fit.
'I could channel my mind in a certain way. And I think the way I dealt with the death of young Jim was I tried to keep it out of my head, I didn't let it in.
'It was a horrendous time, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. It was just terrible and tragic.
'He was 17 and it was a car accident. I'd just got him the car a couple of months before.'
Tragically, Jim also suffered the loss of his father when he was just a child.
In a 2006 interview with the Sun, Michelle admitted that she was still then living haunted by her younger brother's death, confessing that even after a decade her heart-wrenching loss was still 'very raw and painful.'
Aged 28 at the time, she said: 'Sometimes I think I spot him in a crowd of people and I find myself doing a double take.
'You think you are alright and then suddenly 'wham!' - it just gets you right in the heart.
'Losing him was very hard on my family. But I think that's one of the reasons my parents' marriage is so strong today.
Michelle's father Jim Watt is a much-respected boxing pundit with Sky Sports (left). He had a hugely successful in-ring career, including becoming lightweight champion of the world (right)
'If they can survive that they can survive anything.'
Michelle and car sales manager husband Paul had been together since she was 14.
She was just really fun to be around and such a lovely, genuine person and so hard-working
Comedian Des Clarke
They only recently moved into their dream home following Jaymi's birth, who Michelle conceded would be her only child.
She made the decision after her morning sickness during pregnancy became so unbearable that she had to routinely attend hospital - affecting her ability to present live television.
Police Scotland confirmed Michelle's death.
A spokesman said: 'Police in Forth Valley were called to an address around 6.15pm on Wednesday June 24 where the body of a 38-year-old woman was found.
'There are no suspicious circumstances and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.'

	Tracy McPhee-Travers, 36, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, is appealing to all women to make sure they have their smear tests after ignoring hers, and discovering that she has terminal cervical cancer.

A terminally ill mother is appealing to all women to make sure they have their smear tests after she ignored hers and has been left fighting for her life.
Tracy McPhee-Travers, 36, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, is now paying the biggest price for not having the routine scans after she was told her cervical cancer was terminal.
The mother-of-three is now in a desperate race against time to raise 50,000 for pioneering treatment in a bid to see her three daughters grow up.
Race against time: Tracy, second from left, with her children, Angelena (right), 10, Tracy, 13 (left), and 15-year-old Jasmine (second from right), is setting up a Go Fund Me page to raise money for cancer treatment
The mother-of-three was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2013 - after never before having a smear test
Without the money, Tracy, who has set up a Go Fund Me page to raise the cash, fears she only has months to live.
She said: 'I have paid the biggest price for my own ignorance and stupidity.
'I plead with every woman out there not to do what I have done. Have your smear tests. It really could save your life.
'I'm now fighting to stay alive to see my children grow up which could have been so easily prevented if only I'd had the tests like I should have done.'
Tracy, who is a single mother to Angelena, 10, Tracy, 13, and 15-year-old Jasmine,was first diagnosed with cervical cancer in January last year, after a five-month battle with her GP to get referred.
She said: 'From August 2013, I was in constant pain, crippled by severe abdominal cramps and loss of blood.
'I pleaded with my GP for help, but I was told at least 10 times that what I was experiencing wasn't abnormal and lots of women have the same problems.'
Tracy is looking to raise a total of 50,000 and has so far managed to reach 6,174 on her Go Fund Me page
Tracy, pictured above left and right with her three children, says she wants to raise the money so she can have treatment in New York so that her 'girls can grow up with a mother'
She says she accepts she had never been for a smear test, which  for women aged 25 and over are available on the NHS and should be undertaken every three years.
Tracy said: 'Life was just very busy bringing up my three girls and it constantly slipped my mind. There was always something else to do.'
She added: 'But when I did ask for help, my pleas fell on deaf ears for five months, despite the agony I was in and the fact that I had lost over two stone in weight.
'Some days I literally couldn't lift myself out of bed. My daughters had to help me get up and dressed as I was so weak and in so much pain.'
I was absolutely devastated. I felt as though my world was crashing in around me. All I could think about was my three daughters and how I had to fight this awful disease for their sakes
Tracy claims her doctor told her she needed a smear test but couldn't have one until the bleeding stopped.
But in December 2013, after nearly collapsing in the surgery, she was finally referred to Barnsley Hospital for scans and a colposcopy, a procedure to find out whether a woman's cervix contains any abnormal cells.
Within two weeks, Tracy was called back for the results and was told she had a Grade 4 three centimetre tumour within her womb that had spread a further inch outside her womb lining.
The cancer had also been detected in Tracy's lymph nodes.
Tracy said: 'I was absolutely devastated. I felt as though my world was crashing in around me. All I could think about was my three daughters and how I had to fight this awful disease for their sakes.'
Tracy was referred to Weston Park Hospital, in Sheffield, where she immediately began a course of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and finally brachytherapy.
She said: 'After the treatment finished, I started to feel a lot better. I got my appetite back and began putting on weight.
'I was still tired but thought that was just a side effect of the treatment.'
Tracy, pictured with her children, said: 'All I want is to make sure I'm there for my girls until they are old enough to look after themselves and can live without me'

But in January this year, Tracy was dealt the devastating blow that the cancer had spread to her lungs.
She was offered another course of chemotherapy, but warned the side effects would leave her with no quality of life, and was advised to go home and spend what time she had left with her daughters.
Tracy, who easily becomes breathless and is on tablets to control the pain she suffers, said: 'I was absolutely stunned. I couldn't believe what I was hearing.
'I asked how long I had left and was told six months. That means I'm already on borrowed time. Really I shouldn't be here now.
'But I couldn't just give in and leave my daughters without a mother. I'd read about immunotherapy and contacted a clinic in New York that specialises in the treatment.'
Last week, Tracy was accepted on the trial but now must raise the money to pay for it.
Friends and family of the mother have now launched an appeal to help her fulfill Tracy's sole wish of seeing her daughters become adults.
Tracy, pictured with her daughter Angelena, said: 'Im overwhelmed by everyone's support. Knowing they are trying to help me stay alive, really does keep me going'
Tracy has launched a Go Fund Me page to raise 50,000 for treatment in New York that costs 1,590 a session
She explained: 'All I want is to make sure I'm there for my girls until they are old enough to look after themselves and can live without me.
'But without treatment, I won't survive. The cancer will kill me and my girls will grow up without a mother.
'It's every mother's worst nightmare and something I really can't contemplate.'
Tracy is now in a desperate bid against time to start the treatment in New York that could save her life. She has been accepted on a US-based PDL1 immunotherapy treatment plan to start later this month.
The treatment works by helping a person's body fight cancerous cells by recognising these cells as imposters. However it will cost 1,590 per session and Tracy may need at least seven months' worth of treatment.
She and her daughters, along with Tracy's mother, will have to stay in New York until the treatment is finished, needing money for the medical costs, accommodation and living expenses.
Tracy said: 'A conservative estimate of how much I will need is 50,000 but I know that could escalate depending on how many sessions I need. I'm still waiting for confirmation from the doctors in New York.'
Her anxious family and friends have launched an appeal and made a heartfelt plea for people to help pay for the costly treatment. Along with family members savings, they have raised 20,000, but still have a very long way to go.
An emotional Tracy, who says she is in constant excruciating pain, said she is desperate to live if only for her daughter's sakes.
She said: 'Im overwhelmed by everyone's support. Knowing they are trying to help me stay alive, really does keep me going.
'Everyone is doing so much - I'm completely humbled. I can't thank them enough.
'I have to fight this awful disease for my girls. I need to be here when they come home from school, or need a hug after their first tiff with a boyfriend. I want to see them get married and have families of their own.
'So I will do everything I can to fight this horrible condition.'

'Their propensity to commit crimes where the risk appears to me to outweigh the gain has most surprised me. I mean, would you climb on to the front of a moving vehicle for as little as 150?'.
Romanians have the highest per capita population in British jails of any foreign nationality, with 674 of the 128,000-strong population in jail or on remand.
Last year a gang of 11 men were jailed for two years each after admitting a 'Romanian Rollover' theft on the M6 in Staffordshire.
DIY: This is a van seized by police in Britain last year, where a gang cut their own hole the roof to start stealing from lorries
Exit: A hatch is then installed to allow the gangsters in and out of the vehicle, which is hidden from other motorists unless they can see on to the roof
Space: Adapting a van like this one allows the thieves to store large, high value items sent make using a human chain
Their Citroen Relay was followed by police at it travelled north on the M6 through Birmingham and was eventually stopped at Keele Services in Staffordshire. The men were arrested by Central Motorway Police officers.
The gangs vehicle was found to have a home-made lockable hatch in its roof and on board were several power tools.
The men were charged were Romanians Ion Dumitru, 22; Marius Caldararu, 37; Ionel Ursaru, 38; Ionita Caldararu, 33; Alin Vaduva, 34; Corado Dumitrascu, 22; Nicolae Constantin, 36; Craisor Mitrache, 34; Felix Macelaru, 32; Ionut Baboi, 27, and Micera Nicusor, 28.
The convictions  follows a dedicated operation carried   called Operation Trivium  tackling foreign national offenders using the regions roads, which still continues.
Gangs have successfully carried out robberies in Romania, Germany, Ireland and Britain, often stealing televisions, cigarettes and coffee.

More than 850 passengers had to be evacuated after their Mediterranean cruise ship collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Turkey, leaving a huge dent in its hull.
Authorities said a huge disaster was averted after emergency service quickly responded to reports that the Celestyal Crystal and the tanker STI Pimlico had crashed at 1.30am on Saturday morning in the Dardanelles Strait.
Cruise operators said two crew members and a passenger suffered minor injuries in the accident as the vessel, registered to Malta, made its way from Greece to Istanbul.
Evacuated: 853 passengers were taken off their ship, bound for Istanbul, after it collided with an oil tanker
Damage: The hull of the Celestyal Crystal was badly damaged after the incident at 1.30am on Saturday
Spill: Emergency services working quickly to stop a fire or explosion when oil poured out of the tanker
All of its 853 passengers and 382 staff were taken to safety by a sea bus to Gallipoil, and the rest of their journey was cancelled while structural damage to the front of the ship is being fixed.
Emergency services moved quickly to douse the tanker in water to prevent a fire or explosion after fuel spilled out of the 182-metre long tanker, which had been travelling from Russia to Malta carrying flammable naptha fuel.
It has not yet been established how the collision took place.

	Nick Harry's son Sam died of a catastrophic brain haemorrhage after he was thrown at a surface with a force equivalent to a 60mph car crash at his mother's home in Bedford in 2013.

'We are unable to have any sort of justice - even though police know one of them killed my son. I want justice for Sam and for anyone that comes into contact with them in the future.'
Buffham and Bate were arrested on suspicion of murder the day after Sam's death in April 2013 but were released last November without charge.
Tests revealed he had suffered the injuries in the 11 hours before an ambulance was called and he was taken for emergency surgery to relieve the swelling on his brain.
But his condition deteriorated and Sam died four days later on April 24, with his father at his side.
The little boy had been in the care of his mother Deanna Buffham and her boyfriend Ryan Bate at the time
Sam's mother and partner were arrested on suspicion of his murder but released without charge after police failed to prove which of them was responsible
In the days leading up to his death, while he was in intensive care at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, Mr Harry was only told the incident had been a 'trauma'.
'I thought it was standard that police would be in hospital for a case like this. At no point did I know it was because it was being treated as a murder investigation,' he said.
'When they told me they were treating it as murder and said who their main suspects were I just couldn't believe it. It turned my whole world upside down - it still has to this day.'
He added: 'I think it was best I didn't know what had happened at that point because I was just there entirely for Sam at his bedside.'
Mr Harry demanded a review of the CPS decision and was told that it would not be possible to charge both of them 'simply because we know one of them must be guilty of the offence'.
A letter from the CPS read: 'Neither suspect accepts that they caused Sams injuries... each now asserts that the other must have been responsible given the medical findings.
'Although each blames the other, they are unable to give any material evidence to substantiate their belief.'
Sam at Addenbrooke's Hospital, where he had emergency surgery to relieve swelling on his brain
Mr Harry kept a bedside vigil and was shocked when police told him his son's death was being treated as a murder investigation and that the main suspects were his ex-girlfriend and her new partner
Chief prosecutors say because both parties left the house on the day of the incident, they cannot prosecute under a 'joint enterprise' basis
Mr Harry with his son before his death in April 2013. Initially he was not told the details of what had happened
Buffham and Bate were arrested on suspicion of murder the day after Sam's death in April 2013 but were released last November without charge
He has now launched an online petition named Justice for Sam in a bid to overturn the Crown's decision, which needs 100,000 signatures before it can be handed over to Parliament.
'At the moment these two are walking around scot-free. It's inconceivable that they could get a job working with children in the future as they have no criminal record.
'I want the Government to investigate this loophole that allowed both suspects to lie to protect each other and evade prosecution.'
A CPS spokesperson said: 'This case was reviewed as part of the Victims Right to Review Scheme. A specialist prosecutor undertook an independent and comprehensive examination of the evidence.
'This review determined that the original decision to take no further action still stands because there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against either suspect.
'The charges of murder, manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child were considered, however, there is insufficient evidence to prove that either one of the suspects caused the little boys injuries, or to prosecute them both on a joint enterprise basis.'
Bedfordshire Police said it is 'not looking at anyone else' in connection with Sam's death, but added that ever murder investigation is subject to reviews including this one.
His father is campaigning to have the decision overturned and is fighting for justice for his little boy
In a letter from the CPS to Mr Harry, they said that they could not prosecute because each party is blaming the other

However, the same day medics at Great Ormond Street Hospital suggested they talk to Professor Shakeel Saeed, a neurosurgeon at University College London Hospitals. He wanted to expand the use of auditory brain implants in children in Britain.
But brain surgery had serious risks, the doctors stressed, especially to a toddler, and only a few such operations had ever been carried out on children worldwide. Furthermore, Prof Saeed had not performed the operation on a child before.
Mr Armitage, 42, who works for Royal Mail, recalled: We knew success rates varied. But the first time we met Professor Saeed, he put us at such ease.
The neurologist assembled a team with other experts and in May 2013 Leia had an operation in which they implanted 12 signal-carrying electrodes directly on to the brainstem. They mimic the auditory nerve, carrying electrical signals from a hearing aid type device directly to the brain. One of those involved in the operation, Dan Jiang  head of the Hearing Implant Centre at St Thomas Hospital in London  described the procedure as revolutionary for children with no auditory nerve. It is their only chance of ever accessing sound, he said.
Hope: Medics at Great Ormond Street Hospital suggested that the family talk to Professor Shakeel Saeed, a neurosurgeon at University College London Hospitals, whowanted to expand the use of auditory brain implants in children in Britain
By a quirk of fate, medics decided to switch the new machine on on Leias second birthday. However, they warned Leias parents there was no guarantee of success because initial scans suggested the device hadnt worked.
Mr Armitage said: That was a bad moment for us. We sat there thinking: What have we done? Weve put her through all this trauma, and quite possibly its not going to work.
Mrs Armitage added: When she was switched on, Bob and I didnt see any difference in Leia. But the experts saw movement in her eyes. They saw she was blinking to loud noises, and they were thrilled.
Then, on the Tube home, we noticed she was turning her head when the doors were closing, and shed never done that before. And we thought: Shes hearing something!
Prof Saeed said it was impossible to know how Leia experienced sound, but it was likely to be a very different sensation to those with normal hearing. Her parents said Leia can now understand a wide range of words. Mrs Armitage said: Her hearing has become really finely tuned, and shes hearing some quite low levels of sound now. Nobody in their wildest dreams thought shed get to that level with brainstem surgery.
On her third birthday, they sang Happy Birthday but Leia had not really understood it, they said.
But over the past year her hearing has improved so much that she had started to enjoy watching TV and listening to music.
Prof Saeed said the team hopes to carry out more such operations on children lacking auditory nerves: The alternative is a world of silence.
Better future: Mrs Armitage said nobody in their wildest dreams thought shed get to that level with brainstem surgery. Professor Saeed now wants to carry out more of the operations to help other children in Britain

	US President Barack Obama has met Sir David Attenborough at the White House to ask for advice on climate change and conservation during an extraordinary interview on the future of the planet.

He adds: 'We're not moving as fast as we need to and part of what I know from watching your programmes, and all the great work you've done, is that these ecosystems are all interconnected.
'If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not then we're not going to solve the problem, we're going to have to have a global solution to this.'
Sir David, who was sent an air ticket out of the blue to visit the White House, explained that he believes people must be educated that caring for the planet is our responsibility.
He said: 'I think what's required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance.
Barack Obama interviews Sir David Attenborough at the White House
Sir David Attenborough said: 'On my 89th birthday it was to my considerable surprise to find myself in a place that I've never been to before ... to visit the White House with the President of the United States'
'This is the only planet we've got and we've got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively - it is, after all, where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.'
The interview might also be a pointer towards what Obama is considering for his next career.
Earlier this month, Sir David claimed following the pair's meeting that the US President could follow in the footsteps of former Vice President turned environmentalist Al Gore when he leaves office.
Obama is currently in his second and final term, which will come to an end in January 2017.
This is the only planet we've got and we've got to protect it
Sir David Attenborough
Sir David said he had come away from the interview feeling that Obama was 'very much in favour of dealing with climate change' but got the sense he was 'wondering what he's going to do next'.
It is the latest in a series of unusual media appearances for Obama, who has tried to tap any avenue that reaches as many eyeballs as possible to get his message out.
To reach young people he wanted to sign up for Obamacare, his signature health care insurance program, he talked to comedian Zach Galifianakis for the web series 'Between Two Ferns.'
Obama, a Democrat, has also joked with other comedians on late night television and exploited every possible social media tool, even doing his own jousting in the political arena of Twitter.
Sir David has been making television documentaries for 60 years and has been called 'the godfather of natural history TV' by the BBC.
Big fan: During the interview, Obama tells The Living Planet presenter: 'I have been a huge admirer of your work for a very long time ... you've been a great educator as well as a great naturalist'
Sir David: 'What animal would I be? Probably the leopard slug!'
Obama's interview with Sir David comes as the US President's administration finalises rules to curb carbon emissions from power plants. He has pushed world leaders to agree to new targets at a summit later this year in Paris.
Obama told Sir David that children are 'much more environmentally aware' than adults, citing his daughters Malia, 16, and Sasha, 13, as examples.
'They do not dispute, for example, the science around climate change,' Obama said in the clip.
Sir David agreed that adults lose the fascination with nature that is common among children.
He said: 'A five-year-old, turning over a stone and seeing a slug, says, "What a treasure!" Kids understand the natural world.'

Another Twitter user wrote: 'I guess this is what she looked like four days after she died.'
One launched a direct attack on the sculptors, saying: 'If you don't know how to make statues, don't go and do something so unfair to the beautiful Nefertiti.'
In a number of tweets, the bust was compared to the statue of Frankenstein in an old Egyptian film, it was reported by BBC Trending .
The statue, which was installed at the entrance to the city of Samalout, was intended to be a replica of the famously beautiful3,300-year old  bust unearthed in Ammarna in 1912.
Ugly: In a number of tweets, the bust was compared to the statue of Frankenstein in an old Egyptian film
But the groundswell of criticism has been so fervent officials have now removed the statue after just a few days, it was reported by Ahram .
The head of Samalout city, Gamal Kanaway, said the bust would be replaced with a statue of a peace dove.
Queen Nefertiti ruled alongside her husband, Pharaoh Akhenaten during the 14th Century BC.
Beauty is even written into her name, which translates as 'the beautiful one has come'.
The original bust is currently housed in Berlin's Neuse Museum.
Statue was meant to be a replica of the 3,300-year-old bust
QUEEN NEFERTITI REVERED FOR HER BEAUTY... BUT DID SHE HAVE 'BOTOX'?
The bust of Nefertiti, who died around 1330 BC aged between 29 and 38, is one of the most widely recognised Ancient Egyptian artefacts after the mask of the king Tutankhamen who may have been her son.
It was found in Egypt in 1912 at Tell el-Amarna, the short-lived capital of Nefertiti's husband, the Pharaoh Akhenaten. It is now housed in Berlin's Altes Museum.
Ever since its first public exhibition in 1923, the precision of the 3,300-year-old sculpture's symmetrical lines and its finely wrought features have drawn thousands of admirers from around the globe.
But in 2010, researchers claimed that a delicately carved face in the limestone core of the famous bust suggested the royal sculptor at the time may have smoothed creases around the mouth and fixed a bumpy nose to depict the 'Beauty of the Nile' in a better light.
The first suggestion that she may have had the ancient equivalent of botox and a nose job came a year earlier when German scientists analysed the limestone carving with CT scans.
Their analysis showed that compared to the outer stucco face, the inner face had less prominent cheekbones, a slight bump on the ridge of the nose, creases around the corner of mouth and cheeks, and less depth at the corners of the eyelids.
Egyptian officials have named the Nefertiti bust and the Rosetta Stone at the British Museum in London among five precious artefacts held abroad which they want to bring home, with mediation from the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO.

According to some accounts, the terrorist also lobbed grenades at holidaymakers who became trapped in the corridor at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse.
Former RAF serviceman Mr Callaghan, 63, dived into a room with six other people and rammed desks and chairs against the door  before realising to his horror his wife of 40 years was not with him.
He told The Mail on Sunday: 'I looked around and Christine wasn't there. Then I could hear her screaming: 'Help me, I've been shot.''
With tears welling in his eyes, he added: 'At that moment I didn't know if she was going to die or not. I did think the very worst  that I was going to lose her.'
Mr Callaghan, who was himself suffering from a bullet wound to his right leg, nearly tore the barricade down to reach his wife but realised that doing so would endanger the others taking refuge in the room.
He said: 'You could hear the gunfire  we dared not open the door.'

Predator: Assault rifle in hand, Regzui was pictured stalking the streets of the popular holiday resort town Sousse where he and possible accomplices killed at least 38 people
His wife, who works as a healthcare assistant at Cromer Hospital in Norfolk, said: 'I felt the bullet hit me and I went straight down. My right leg was bent across my body and the pain was incredible.
'The bullet went into my beach bag, smashing everything and ricocheted off my sunglasses case and out into my femur.
'I'm lucky to be alive  without the beach bag there, the bullet would have gone straight into my abdomen and my vital organs.'
Despite her horrific injuries  the 60-year-old grandmother's thigh bone was shattered by a bullet  she managed to comfort another British woman who was writhing in pain next to her with four bullet holes in her back.
She said: 'I just started calling for Tony, then I saw a woman next to me with four bullet wounds. I was in a lot of pain but the woman next to me was much worse. She was very calm and quiet  she was bleeding badly.
'I kept talking to her and holding her hand. She told me her name was Shirley. Her husband, who said he was called Joe, was there but he was beside himself and just panicking.' She said she had later heard Shirley was recovering.

After Rezgui had moved on, and it was safe to venture out of the office, Mr Callaghan not only had to care for his injured wife, but also had to break the news to a young British man named Liam that the fiancee he had planned to marry in two weeks was dead from bullet wounds to her chest.
He said: 'There was blood everywhere. I bent down and kissed my wife and said: 'Everything will be OK.' She was crying. I looked over Shirley's injuries for a second and knew I needed to help her.
'I heard the sound of someone talking five yards down the corridor so I walked down and there was a young guy holding a woman. She was on her back and had been shot in the chest and stomach.'
Mr Callaghan said: 'He looked up at me and said: 'What can I do? It's my fiancee and we are getting married in two weeks' time'.
DESPERATE TWITTER SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS
Many families turned to Twitter last night pleading for news about their loved ones.
Sara Boyle tweeted: 'Ray and Angela Fisher missing in Sousse. Please retweet this  please help. Angela often called Angie.'
And Samuel Stocker wrote: 'Find John and Janet Stocker#Tunisia #SousseAttacks.'
The family of John Welch, 74, from Wiltshire and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70, said they had not spoken to them since Thursday.
Mr Welch's grandson Daniel Welch, 29, from Swindon, said: 'We can only expect the worst.'
Missing: Samuel Stocker wrote: 'Find John (right) and Janet (left) Stocker#Tunisia #SousseAttacks' - his mother and father
Heartbroken: Sara Boyle tweeted: 'Ray (top) and Angela Fisher (bottom) missing in Sousse. Please retweet this'
Disappeared: The family of John Welch (right), 74, from Wiltshire and his partner Eileen Swannack left), 70, said they had not spoken to them since Thursday
'He said she was getting cold and I bent down and checked her pulse. She was dead, I could tell. He said his name was Liam.
'I just said to him: 'Sorry, Liam, I can't find her pulse.' I didn't know what else to say. She was just a young girl. I had seen them arrive, they looked a lovely couple and very happy. It's just heart-breaking.'
Last night the Liam Mr Callaghan described was believed to be Liam Moore, who lost his fiancee Carly Lovett, 24, a photographer, beautician and fashion blogger from Lincolnshire, in the attack.
Mr and Mrs Callaghan's ordeal began when they were sitting around the pool at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel and heard gunshots from the beach 100 yards away.
Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Callaghan, who works for Norfolk police and lives with his wife in North Walsham, said many of the holidaymakers thought the noise was fireworks but because of his military training he recognised the ominous bangs and urged everyone to run for safety.
Silent: The beach would have been filled with tourists yesterday, but now it is taped off - with thousands of tourists now waiting to board emergency flights home after the horrendous attack
Contemplative: Tourists sit at the terrace of the Imperiale Marhaba hotel after a gunman opened fire at the beachside hotel in Sousse
Embrace: Scared tourists comfort one another at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel having survived the terrifying gun attack outside the beachside hotel
Once in the hotel, they were directed up a staircase to the left of the lobby by staff but they heard the gunman behind them and realised they were trapped.
Another couple, Ross Thompson, 21, and Rebecca Smith, 22, from Coventry, were treated for shrapnel wounds apparently caused by a grenade.
Miss Smith had injuries to her face, head, arms and legs, while Mr Thompson, a fire safety engineer, was lucky not to lose a toe. He said: 'The gunman was behind us, shooting. There was a puff of smoke and I felt shrapnel hit my foot.
'The adrenaline kept me going and we managed to get into an office off the corridor and barricade ourselves in. Becky hid under a desk.'
Miss Smith said: 'I've never been so scared in my whole life. You are on holiday relaxing  you just don't expect something like this to happen. It's terrible. I don't feel safe in this hospital. I just want to get out of here as soon as possible.'
Survivors:Rebecca Smith (top), 22, and her boyfriend Ross Thompson (bottom) came face to face with a Tunisian terroristwhen bungling hotel staff sent them fleeing down a dead-end corridor
Emergency: Dozens of British tourists are being treated at the Sahloul University Hospital in Tunisia
In a miraculous escape, Tom Richards, a university graduate who was on holiday with his mother and younger brother, found himself face-to-face with the terrorist in the hotel. Rezgui shot two people in the head, before turning his attention to Mr Richards.
The 22-year-old said: 'He looked right at me, I thought I was dead.'
But instead of shooting Mr Richards, he shot the floor  allowing Mr Richards and his mother, who were injured by shards of marble, to escape to a nearby toilet. 'I don't know why he stopped. He could have killed everybody,' he said.
Other injured Britons include Kirsty Murray, 25, from Braintree, Essex, who was being treated for four gunshot wounds to her wrists and legs after Rezgui opened fire as she relaxed by the pool.
Her fianc, Radley Ruszkiewicz, who turned 29 yesterday, suffered shrapnel wounds to his lower legs which he thinks were caused by a grenade thrown by the terrorist.
They were being treated at different hospitals in Sousse.
MISSING BRITONS CONFIRMED DEAD AS SONS PAY TRIBUTE ON TWITTER
Two Britons missing in Tunisia following the attacks yesterday have been confirmed dead.
Suzanne Davey, 44, and partner Scott Chalkley, 42, had been on holiday together in Sousse to celebrate buying their first house together when the shootings broke out.
Their sons Conor Fulford and Ross Naylor had spent all of yesterday frantically appealing on social media for information on the pair, but late last night confirmed they had both died.
Briton Suzanne Davey, 44 (left), and her partner Scott Chalkley, 42 (right), who were reported missing in Tunisia have been confirmed as dead, their sons have said
Paying tribute to mother Ms Davey on Twitter, Mr Fulford wrote: 'Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight.'
Mr Fulford began his frantic search for information after seeing what he believed to be his mother's body on a stretcher on Sky News.
His frantic appeals received thousands of retweets and shares online, as Tunisia's foreign minister said at least 15 Britons were among the dead.
Meanwhile, Mr Chalkley's son Ross was making similar appeals, before sending out a final tweet confirming that his father had been killed.
He wrote: 'Tonight, me and Brad lost our Dad, unfortunately he was caught up in the sickening attacks in Tunisia and is no longer with us.
'I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped, you have all been amazing. One love to all and rest in peace Dad.'

	Poldark made its US TV debut earlier this week - and the response to leading man Aidan Turner, 32, was just as lustful. Many viewers took to Twitter to share their love for the Irish star, 32.

'Damn, this Poldark guy is HAWT,' read one exuberant missive, while another, sent by Twitter user Jenn Nimthiriel read: '#Poldark was... amazing. #AidanTurner was beautiful, I don't get how he gets to be so perfect.'
One particularly enthusiastic fan even created a montage of the ways in which they found Poldark attractive, tweeting the result alongside a caption that read: 'Let us count the ways we found Ross Poldark hot on #PoldarkPBS... In a Tricorn, in a cloak, on a cliff, in a church!'
Another, Karla Nichelle, wrote: 'Omg finally sitting down and watching #Poldark... This man is SO fine. I'm sweating.'
Others found it difficult to choose between the Cornish countryside and Mr Turner for beauty, with one writing:
Counting the ways: One fan created a montage of moments in which they found Mr Turner attractive
Favourite show: Viewers also appeared to enjoy the romantic storyline
Who's more lovely? Some viewers couldn't decide whether they liked Cornwall or Mr Turner more
Sold! Others were clearly fans of the concept before they'd even seen the show
Hit! Mr Turner  clearly made an impression on Twitter user Erin Ruberry
'The #PoldarkPBS credits elegantly, economically establish the show's primary conflict: Which is prettier - Aidan Turner or Cornwall?'
Another came down firmly on the side of the landscape, tweeting: 'The scenery is beyond beautiful in this show. And yes, I did mean the landscape ;) #PoldarkPBS.'
Most, however, opted for Mr Turner. Social media user Erin Ruberry, clearly already a fan of a British drama, said:
'You had me at "British soldier", "Cornwall" and "true love" #PoldarkPBS. I am so in.'
Later, perhaps in response to the famous shirtless scything scene, she added: 'I'll just be here googling Aidan Turner GIFS if you need me. #PoldarkPBS'
Poldark has now proved a hit on both sides of the Atlantic and became the BBC's most popular drama of 2015 so far thanks to viewing figures that regularly topped seven million.
Smouldering: The famous scything scene worked its magic for the second time in the US
Popular: Irishman Mr Turner was once again the viewers' favourite
Local boy: Kyle Soller (Francis Poldark) hails fromConnecticut but wasn't as popular as Mr Turner
The finale, which aired on the 26th April, achieved 5.9 million viewers and an audience share of 25.4 per cent.
As a result, the show was swiftly recommissioned with filming for the second series due to commence at the end of August.
The series, based on Winston Grahams novels, follows Ross Poldark after he returns from the American War of Independence only to find that his father has died and his former fiance, Elizabeth, has married another man.
There are 12 Poldark books in total, seven of which are set in the 18th century. The other five then follow Poldarks children through the 19th century.
The first series of Poldark, written by Debbie Horsfield, covers the first of Mr Grahams two novels, named after Ross Poldark and Demelza.
The second series will move on to the third and fourth books, named after their child, Jeremy, and scheming banker George Warleggan.

Miss McAdam, 56, a judge on BBC 2 show Hair which begins July 13 and is described as the hairdressing equivalent of The Great British Bake Off, has cut the hair of the royal family for more than three decades.
She became well-known in 1986 when she styled the Duchess of Yorks hair for her wedding to the Duke of York. In 2010, she received the Royal Victorian Medal for hairdressing services to the royal family.
As she handed her the award - which is a personal gift from the Queen - Her Majesty said to Denise, Youve been with us a long time. You have done my sons and my grandchildren too. She also received a handwritten note of thanks from every member of the royal family - including Princess Anne.
Asked to reveal the biggest mistakes women make with their hair, Miss McAdam said it was opting for a massive restyle or change of colour a week before their wedding: Big mistake, thats definitely not a good time to do it. You would be amazed how many women do it. I also think another big mistake is not understanding how to talk to your hairdresser or the hairdresser not listening to you.
Denise McAdam is a judge on BBC 2 show Hair
Ms McAndrew has been the Queen's hairdresser for several years and has been rewarded for her service
Pop star Taylor Swift may be the woman of the moment, but Miss McAdam advised against copying her bob haircut.
She said: Pop stars are quite influential as are presenters at the moment. You have to work with your hairdresser, you cant just look at these girls and think you can have that hairstyle because each head of hair is different. You have to work the look to suit you, a new angle on that look. A pair of trousers may be fashionable but not everyone suits those trousers so you got for a different angle on it.

	General Karenzi Karake, director-general of Rwanda's national intelligence agency, is accused of ordering massacres in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
      </Description>

Asked by Judge Purdy whether he would comply with the extradition proceedings, the general replied: 'I will co-operate.'
Prosecutor Aaron Watkins said the arrest warrant related to five alleged offences which carry a maximum prison sentence of 30 years.
'This is a defendant who has no ties in the UK,' Mr Watkins said.
'He is a Rwandan national whose presence in the UK was intended to be short term.'
Mrs Blair was seen arriving with the rest of Karake's legal team at Westminster Magistrates' Court yesterday
Mr Watkins said it was clear the Rwandan government 'did not accept the legitimacy of these proceedings'.
'It's perfectly plain their feelings towards these proceedings are outrage,' he added.
Mark Summers QC, defending Karake, said his client was 'a man of impeccable character' with a title in Rwanda comparable to the director of the CIA in America.
'He's not a rogue army officer,' he said. 'He's a senior member of a respected and democratic government.
'The context of these allegations is the government's battle to end the 1994 genocide.
Karake (pictured) was detained at Heathrow on Saturday on behalf of the Spanish authorities
'This is a private prosecution in Spain by private interest groups with links to those responsible for the underlying genocide.'
Mr Summers said Rwanda was not alone in its outrage about the indictment as the US had labelled it a 'bloated political tract'.
Karake's supporters began singing in the public gallery as he left the dock, while Rwanda's High Commissioner, Attorney General and the country's ambassador to Spain also sat in the well of the court.
Mrs Blair confirmed yesterday that Karake would not be immediately released from custody.
Speaking outside the courtroom, Johnston Busingye, Rwanda's minister for justice and attorney general, said: 'We did not expect General Karake would be arrested in the UK. When it happened we trusted we would make our case when the day comes in the court of law.'
Asked whether the arrest would affect Rwanda's relationship with the UK, he replied: 'Our relationship with the UK is bigger and longer and I would not want to narrow it.'
Karake's arrest on Saturday was condemned by Rwanda's High Commissioner in London, Williams Nkurunziza, as 'an insult', and former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell claimed it was 'politically motivated'.
Mr Mitchell, who worked closely with the Rwandan government while a Cabinet minister, said the European arrest warrant system was being 'abused', with the allegations pursued by supporters of the old regime in Rwanda.
More than a dozen protesters waving placards in support of General Karake - who is nicknamed KK - gathered outside the court ahead of the hearing.
The placards included the messages 'Stop humiliating Africa,' 'freekarake' and 'UK, USA stand up against the Spanish indictment'.
Another placard read: 'Rwandan Community in the UK stand by our hero Lt Gen Karenzi Karake'.
One protester, who gave his name only as Peter, said: 'The embassy has its own official duties but we as Rwandans and compatriots of General KK are here to support him.'
A case management hearing will take place at the court on September 26 before a full extradition hearing on October 29 and 30.

John Hannett, general secretary of shopworkers' union Usdaw, added: 'This Act is a great British compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years and gives everyone a little bit of what they want.
'Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work, whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shopworkers can spend some time with their family.'
He added: 'We will vigorously campaign against such a proposal and we would be looking for the Government to learn from their two consultations and failed trial period (during the London Olympics) by leaving alone the existing Sunday trading arrangements agreed by the main stakeholders in the retail industry.'
But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said lifting the restrictions on Sunday opening would 'take precious family time away from shop workers'
Frontrunner for the Labour leadership Andy Burnham today promised to fight the proposals 'all the way'
SUNDAY OPENING HOURS: END OF A 'GREAT BRITISH COMPROMISE'?
At the moment, large stores can only open for six hours between 10am and 6pm on Sundays, while shops with a floor area of less than 3,000 square feet can open all day.
Attempts to remove restrictions on Sunday trading led to bitter disputes in the Eighties and were abandoned after the Shops Bill was defeated in the Commons in 1986.
A compromise deal was finally agreed in 1994.
The rules were lifted for eight weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012, resulting in a significant surge in sales.
But when the Keep Sunday Special group wrote to Mr Cameron before the election asking him to rule out a change in the law, his office said he believed the existing system provided a reasonable balance.
However Adrian Pepper of the Open Sundays campaign group said relaxing Sunday trading laws made sense for modern-day families.
'It is now the norm for adults in most families to be in full time work so the only time they can shop is at the weekend. Restricting Sunday opening makes no sense,' he said.
'The current Sunday trading laws do not preserve any valuable cultural aspects of our way of life.
'They just make life more inconvenient. If you want to go out early on a Sunday morning looking for a wide range of fresh produce to cook for a family Sunday lunch, you cannot.
'If you want to go to church on a Sunday morning, there is even less time to get the shopping done.'
The government claims there is a 'growing appetite' for Sunday trading in high streets and retail parks, and a trial of longer hours during the London Olympics had proved a success.
The Treasury pointed to research by the New West End Company which found two extra hours in the capital alone would create nearly 3,000 jobs and generate over 200 million a year in additional sales.
Freed from the constraints of five years of coalition with the Liberal Democrats, Mr Osborne will use his second Budget of the year to show where he has found 12 billion of welfare savings promised in the Conservative manifesto.
He told MPs that with global economies braced for the impact of the Greek debt crisis, he would use the set-piece to show how the Government intends to 'redouble our own efforts to put our house in order' with continued austerity measures.
Significant savings are expected to the system of tax credits brought in under the previous Labour government to top up the incomes of low-paid working families.
Mr Osborne will use his second Budget of the year tomorrow to show where he has found 12 billion of welfare savings promised in the Conservative manifesto
Mr Osborne is also going further than previously planned in cutting the benefits cap - currently set at 26,000-a-year - not just to 23,000 in London but to a still lower threshold in other parts of the country.
Savings of 250 million will be achieved by forcing 340,000 local authority and housing association tenants on incomes of 40,000 or more in London and 30,000 in the rest of England to pay a market, or near market, rent from 2017/18.
The 600 million-plus annual cost of providing free television licences to the over 75s is also being passed to the BBC from 2018/19 - with the broadcaster deciding whether the policy should continue after 2020.
We need a better economic plan than asking people to spend another day of the week putting debt on their credit cards
TUC chief Frances O'Grady
It may in return be able to extend the licence fee to cover people watching via the online iPlayer and the licence fee is expected to rise in line with the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation.
The Budget is also set to include an end to inheritance tax on family homes worth up to 1 million - at an estimated 1 billion cost to the Exchequer - a key plank of the Conservatives' general election manifesto.
But Mr Osborne appears set to disappoint Tories calling for a cut in the top rate of income tax from 45p to 40p - insisting his priority is raising the tax free allowance to 12,500 and increasing the threshold for the higher rate to 50,000.
The Chancellor is reported to have significant 'wiggle room' because of tax revenues around 15 billion higher than projected at the March budget.
Stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown said it also expected the Treasury to receive an additional 700 million this year - twice official expectations - in tax thanks to new pension freedoms.
Millions of over 55-year-olds have since April been able to cash in their pension pots rather than being forced to buy an annuity and the firm said experience from the early months suggested Mr Osborne was set for a big windfall.
Sunday trading has long been a thorny issue, with pressure building to relax the 1994 Sunday Trading Act which allowed smaller shops to open all day but restricted those over 280 sq m / 3,000 sq ft to six hours between 10am and 6pm.
A review by the then Labour government in 2006 resulted in no change amid protests.
But the Treasury said Britain was out of step with international competitors - with Paris having recently relaxed its rules and New York imposing no controls.

	Campaigners called on the government to do more to stop families 'from falling into crisis', as a quarter of parents fear their children with have a worse life than them.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>23 shares
Parents aged 35-44 have the biggest money problems, with 51 per cent struggling financially.
Some 58 per cent of parents in both Wales and Northern Ireland report struggling to make ends meet, the highest in the UK, compared to 38 per cent in London and the East Midlands.
While more than a third of families are 'struggling' or just about 'surviving', only one in ten (12 per cent) would describe themselves as 'thriving' or 'doing really well'.
Parents of older children also seem to fare worse than those with younger families, and are more likely to be struggling.
Among parents with younger children, a quarter said childcare was one of the 'major challenges' in their daily lives.
Two in five parents say they have nothing left over at the end of the month after paying for essentials including food and bills.
It leaves many having to resort to credit cards, overdrafts and borrowing from friends and family to make ends meet.
Parents aged 35-44 have the biggest money problems, with 51 per cent struggling financially, the poll showed
The survey found that 24 per cent of parents think their children's standard of living will be worse than their own, rising to 40 per cent among the over-75s
It found that 24 per cent of parents think their children's standard of living will be worse than their own, rising to 40 per cent among the over-75s.
The poll comes as 4Children launches a new inquiry into family life in modern Britain today 'Britain's Families: Thriving or Surviving'- uncovering the challenges and opportunities facing families across the country.
Families across the country are on the edge, struggling financially and are finding it difficult to be optimistic about their children's futures
Imelda Redmond,4Children
Chief executive Imelda Redmond said: 'These results issue a triple warning  families across the country are on the edge, struggling financially and are finding it difficult to be optimistic about their children's futures.
'Government should listen to this warning and take action, because preventing families from falling into crisis is not only better for them, but far cheaper in the long run for the taxpayer too.'
It comes ahead of the Budget on July 8 when George Osborne is expected to impose deep cuts on tax credits, paid to people whose income from work is judged not enough to live on.
Ministers have demanded that firms pay their staff properly instead of relying on the benefit system to top up their workers' wages through tax credits.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the government wanted companies to 'take a fuller share of paying people a reasonable and decent salary' instead of relying on tax credits to top up their workers' wages. He said: 'We want companies to pay better salaries, which means less tax credits from us.'
One option being considered is said to be the idea of cutting child tax credit back to levels last seen in 2003, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates would save 5billion but would cost 3.7million low-income families an average of 1,400-a-year.

Now, however, he feels it is time to speak out.
Whitehead, who is writing a book which threatens to expose the seedy world of Doherty, accuses the rock star of breaking her down during the row that took place just hours before her death.
Pete Doherty and Alan Wass argued that she was not trying to tell the right story about Pete Doherty in the film she was making, he says.
They believed she would not tell the truth but Robyn stood her ground. She was an intelligent girl.
Robyn Whitehead, a glamorous heiress to the wealthy Goldsmith dynasty, died after taking heroin
She knew exactly what she was doing and then Wass came along, together with Doherty, that Saturday afternoon and attacked her mentally and broke her down.
A day after the confrontation with Doherty over the documentary, Robyn was found dead in a dingy flat belonging to one of his friends. Her father says: Robyn rang her mother after the row. She was terribly upset.
Whitehead says he had originally started the film project, but passed it on to his daughter.
He says: I had decided I was wasting my time and had better things to do. It was at that point that Robyn, who had been working with me, said Dad, let me finish it.
So unfortunately it was me who introduced Robyn to Pete Doherty on the basis that she would go on to finish my film. It is for me to remember that I introduced them.
While Whitehead starts work on a book about his daughter, another inquest is due to take place. Despite being one of his closest friends, Doherty is unlikely to appear at Westminster Coroners Court in two weeks time when the inquest into the death of Alan Wass begins.
Wass died two months ago of an apparent heart attack after severing an artery in his arm when he fell through a window.
For his mother, Angela, the grief of coming to terms with her only sons death is compounded by the fact that Alans reputation will forever be framed by Doherty.
Sitting on her sofa in her semi-detached home in North London, Angela looks at the ceramic urn in the front room containing her sons ashes. She says: They were friends before Doherty was famous and they carried on their friendship. Doherty was best man at Alans wedding. Alan was a true friend to him.
Alan had just signed a massive record deal. It was the break of his life. His career was taking off.
My son lived for music and he died for music.
Who would think that at 33 he would be dead? When I saw him in that coffin all I wanted him to do was to wake up.
I had made my will just a month before he died and the solicitors came back to me. They said you have not ticked the box in the event that your children pre-decease you and asked me what to do. I told them I did not need to do that because my children would not pre-decease me. Whoever thinks your child is going to die before you?
When I saw him in that coffin all I wanted to do was to wake up
Dohertys rise to fame, if not immediate fortune, began in 1997 with his band The Libertines. Wass played alongside him in the charismatic band whose eponymous album topped the charts in 2004.
Their cult reputation was sealed by Dohertys very public descent into drug addiction and dysfunction that eventually led to him serving time in prison.
At the height of their fame, Doherty was asked to leave the band and eventually the group disbanded, leaving Doherty free to focus on his next band Babyshambles.
His career and drug addiction tracked that of his close friend Amy Winehouse and Dohertys reputation was further enhanced by his tumultuous relationship with supermodel Kate Moss.
Moss and Doherty met in 2005 and their on-off affair only reached the end of the road in 2007, but by then Doherty had already become ensnared in a highly controversial death.
In May 2011, he was jailed for six months for possession of crack cocaine. The singers downfall was sealed by footage that had emerged showing him smoking crack with Robyn Whitehead and Alan Wass.
Two months after his conviction, Winehouse  the multi award-winning singer  died after losing her battle with alcohol.
A fan who modelled himself on Doherty also lost his life after a heroin overdose that year. One of those present at the flat on the night of Mark Blancos death was Johnny Headlock Jeannevol, once a close friend and security manager for Doherty.
After suffering from ill health for several years, Mr Jeannevol believes that he has turned the corner but only after cutting all ties with the controversial singer.
Pete Doherty presents his 'Hope Rehab Thailand Tour'
Alan Wass, pictured on his wedding day to Liza. Doherty was best man at the ceremony, and his mother said he was a 'true friend' to the singer, adding:My son lived for music and he died for music'
He said: I had to stay away from Pete for the sake of my health. It is stressful being with Pete and I had to calm down. I dont have his number any more. But I heard through friends that he was a bit gutted Alan had passed away and was a bit shaken up by it.
When asked why people around Doherty pay such a price, Mr Jeannevol cannot resist a well-worn phrase. He said: Its rock n roll, isnt it?
Mark Blancos mother is still battling with police to discover what really happened the night her son fell from a balcony to his death.
The CCTV footage recovered from the scene would subsequently become the focus of a long-running legal battle between his family and the Metropolitan Police.
An FBI-accredited expert believes that footage of the balcony seconds before Blanco fell proves incontrovertibly that there was another person with him  begging the question of whether he was pushed.
At the subsequent inquest it emerged that Blanco, who once worked for Goldman Sachs, had visited the flat of Paul Roundhill, a close friend of Doherty, in a bid to publicise a play Blanco was putting on.
Doherty had told an acquaintance to 'have a word' with Mark Blanco, and an inquest rejected suicide. But in an interview in 2012, Doherty claimed the police knew he was innocent, although admitted it 'does look dodgy'
Bizarrely the play, Accidental Death Of An Anarchist, features a character who dies after falling out of a window. Roundhill admitted that he had punched Blanco in the face several times.
It also emerged that Doherty had told an acquaintance to have a word with Blanco.
The inquest recorded an open verdict and rejected suicide. The corner called for a fresh investigation.
In an interview with the NME in 2012, Doherty claimed the police understood he was innocent.
The murder squad down at Limehouse, yeah, they opened and closed that case three or four times. The pressure they put on me was completely minimal.
And they kind of said off-tape Pete, were sorry about this, right, but the family are convinced that their son was murdered. I can understand it and it does look dodgy.
In two weeks time, Westminster Coroners Court will hear the inquest of Alan Wass.
A spokesman for Doherty said: The inquest into Alan Wass is pending and therefore it would clearly be inappropriate to comment. Peter Doherty fully co-operated with the police at all times in relation to Mark Blanco and there were no criminal implications for Peter Doherty at all.
On Friday night, Doherty was back on the stage when he performed a surprise gig at the Glastonbury festival.
Swigging from a bottle of beer, he dedicated the song Time For Heroes to his late bandmate, saying: Alan Wass, if youre up there looking down. Or down there looking up.
But Blancos mother Sheila, who is still waiting for a review of the evidence of her sons death, warns Alans parents that they shouldnt expect to hear any words of comfort from the star.
Sheila Blanco says: Doherty has never come forward to say anything about this case. Nor has he ever apologised to me.
He has never even spoken to me.

Critically-acclaimed American civil war movie Gone with the Wind is facing a backlash as the pressure mounts against symbols of the Confederacy.
The New York Post film critic Lou Lumenick has called for the movie to be banned from cinemas, while an artist who is tweeting the entire book has been uninvited to a number of literary events.
Gone with the Wind, first published by author Margaret Mitchell in 1936 before it was made into a film that won 10 Academy Awards, tells the story of the daughter of a plantation owner Scarlett O'Hara and her romantic entanglements.

Across the US politicians and activists have urged for the Confederate flag - which appears in the film - to be removed from public life, while memorials of historical figures from that period have been defaced following the Charleton shootings that left nine black people dead.
Now respected critic Mr Lumenick said Gone with the Wind, still the most successful film at the box office in US cinema, should be consigned to the history books as a racist depiction of the civil war.
'The more subtle racism of 'Gone with the Wind' is in some ways more insidious, going to great lengths to enshrine the myth that the Civil War wasn't fought over slavery - an institution the film unabashedly romanticizes', he wrote .
'But what does it say about us as a nation if we continue to embrace a movie that, in the final analysis, stands for many of the things as the Confederate flag that flutters so dramatically over the dead and wounded soldiers at the Atlanta train station just before the 'GWTW' intermission?'

The themed menu has been created by chef Ellen who will serve her versions of shepherd's pie and alphabetti spaghetti.
There will also be walnut and pomegranate braised lamb served alongside wilted spinach and a pine nut and anchovy dressing on offer.
To finish diners can tuck into cardamom and sour cherry spotted dick with pistachio custard and charred peaches.

SAMPLE MENU 
Alphabet spaghetti served with a summer squash and parmesan broth with sage and walnut pesto.
Shepherds pie course of walnut and pomegranate braised lamb version served alongside wilted spinach and a pine nut and anchovy dressing.
Cardamom and sour cherry spotted dick with pistachio custard and charred peaches.
The ticket price for the event will also include a cocktail workshop and an art class.
The dining room, designed by Alice, will be made to look like a school hall, complete with blackboards on the walls, tables you can draw on and globes
Additionally all diners will receive a pencil case containing their cutlery, a school tie and a cocktail when they arrive.
According to the organisers, prizes, gold stars and punishments will be doled out throughout the evening by a 'particularly strict headmistress' and prefects.
The event will take place in The Round Chapel Old School Rooms in Clapton from 22 July to 6 August.
The restaurant's Twitter account instructs: 'Pack your books, press your uniform and head over to the Clapton Park Round Chapel. Hope you have done your homework.'
However some Twitter users have complained that this latest pop-up could be verging on the ridiculous. 
But not everyone thinks this is a good idea.
Twitter user Ruairi posted on the social media site:' I didn't think anything could be simultaneously so dumb and so weird.'

The trend for restaurant pop-ups is one that has seen London play host to a myriad of interesting themes, from the Porridge Cafe which made its debut early this year to Cannabistro, which served a feast 'designed to recreate the careful ritual of getting high.'

	Alison Pinnock, 47, believes it is only a matter of time before somebody is killed after 60 horrific accidents outside her home in Wickford, Essex, in the last five years.

'We've had cars in our garden, we've had trees falling down and it's almost like there's no point in having a fence.
'I can't go to sleep at night because I'm worried sick about what might happen. There are accidents on the road so often it's become normal.'
Alison, who has taken pictures of the most serious accidents, lives with husband Brian, 62, and her children Ryan, 21, Tyler, 18, Carley, 15 and Ellie, 12.
Mr Pinnock, who works as a maintenance driver for a hygiene company, bought the property 32 years ago but it's only in the past five years that the Pinnocks have had to deal with such a horrific string of car crashes.
A Ford KA and a motorbike were involved in a head-on collision outside the family home at 8.45am on May 25, this year
This Dairy lorry slewed off the road right outside the Pinnock's family home at 6am on February 13, 2013
At 5.15am on January 7 this year, a car slammed into the Pinnock's garden fence
The silver car spun off the road into the Pinnock's driveway at 7.30am on December 28, 2014
Mrs Pinnock told how she struggles to sleep at night due to the high number of accidents
'The authorities have told me that the speed on this stretch of road is appropriate but after logging so many accidents I have to disagree,' said Mrs Pinnock.
'Only a couple of weeks ago, Brian had just finished cleaning the windows to our living room when a car smashed through the fence right by him.
'He could have been seriously hurt or my children could have been out there playing - it's terrifying to think how close this accident was to hurting my loved ones.
'Something must be done about the speed now - we need protection.'
Tyler's room is on the ground floor of Mrs Pinnock's home and she lives in constant fear of a car veering off into the property while he is sleeping.
'I can't sleep at night - It's terrifying.
'I remember the head-on collision last year that happened in the middle of the night. We were woken up at midnight with a car and a taxi smashed up on our drive.
'There were police everywhere, two ambulances and a fire engine - they kept us up all night.
'It was absolutely horrible but it could have been so much worse, someone could have died.
'We have written to the council a number of times about the problems here because we want to see the speed limit reduced from 60mph to 40mph or even 30mph. There's absolutely no way that stretch of road should be a national speed limit.
'People are just driving along here too quickly - we are frightened it's a matter of time before someone is killed.'
At 3.20am on February 3, 2013 a car careered through the Pinnock's wooden fence,left. On May 25 this year, a motorcyclist was taken to hospital by air ambulance, right
Adam Pipe, casualty reduction manager for Essex Police, said: 'I spoke with Mrs Pinnock last week and we have offered to carry out a speed data survey over four days.
'The information can then be presented to Essex County Council, which is the highways authority, to determine the next course of action.
'Mrs Pinnock's home is beside a road within a 60mph national speed limit and at the bottom of a dip.
'A number of the historic collisions in which people have been seriously injured, took place during extremely cold winter weather, when water ran onto the road from nearby fields and froze.'

The Director of Public Prosecutions was facing calls to quit last night as her decision not to prosecute alleged paedophile Lord Janner was dramatically overturned.
The legal U-turn came just days after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the Labour peer had made secret visits to Parliament despite medics claiming he was too ill to be questioned by police.
Critics insisted Alison Saunders could not continue as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service when she had made such a catastrophic mistake over the high-profile case of the 86-year-old, who is accused of molesting boys in care.
Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was facing calls to quit last night as her decision not to prosecute alleged paedophile Lord Janner was dramatically overturned
She provoked fury among police chiefs when she ruled in April that Lord Janner could not be prosecuted because of his dementia, despite detectives collecting enough evidence to charge him with 22 offences against nine victims in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
Mrs Saunders, who earns 205,000 a year, strongly defended her decision  but an external QC was drafted in to reconsider the case after a challenge from alleged victims.
Last night it emerged the CPS has accepted the reviews decision to let the case be heard in court.

Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk  who declared in the Commons last week that Lord Janner had violated, raped and tortured children on school trips to Westminster  led the calls for the DPP to quit.
Mrs Saunders already faced pressure after the 20million failed prosecution of journalists over paying public officials, and the show trial of a doctor accused of female genital mutilation that ended with his acquittal in less than half an hour.
Mr Danczuk said last night: I think she should go. There was a lack of transparency over the decision, she had the case for more than a year, she made the decision when Parliament wasnt sitting and there were doubts about conflicts of interest over the advice.

Loader appalled at initial decision to not prosecute Janner
But more than that we need somebody at the head of the CPS who can not only make legal decisions but someone who also has emotional and political intelligence.
Shes been totally out of touch with public opinion on this and The Mail on Sunday was right to make this such a big issue, as weve had to drag our justice system kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.
Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk (pictured) led the calls for the DPP to quit
Liz Dux of law firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing many of the peers alleged victims, said: This would be total vindication of what my clients have been asking for all along ... they have wanted to give evidence for many years and now look forward to doing so.
Lord Janner will face a trial of the facts  a legal process used when suspects are deemed unfit to enter pleas, instruct lawyers or follow proceedings. A jury will hear the evidence against him and will decide if he did the facts, but there will be no verdict and no sanction.
In some trials of facts, judges can impose hospital orders if the public needs to be protected from a dangerous suspect, but Lord Janner is not considered to pose such a risk.
Daniel Janner, the peers son who is himself a QC, said the matter was now sub judice and he could not comment.
The unprecedented U-turn on a DPPs personal decision comes days after The Mail on Sunday revealed that Lord Janner used his Parliamentary car park pass, signed cheques and told clerks he was there on official business in June 2014  months after police had been told he was too ill to be interviewed.
It can also be revealed today that Lord Janner still has two laptop computers provided by the House of Lords, and reported his Blackberry lost last July, although he no longer has an office in Millbank.
A CPS spokesman said last night: We cannot confirm the outcome of the review until all of the parties have been informed.

	Emma Surgenor, 32, from Blackpool, was given a fright when she looked back at her pictures from a night tour at the Edinburgh vaults and saw what appeared to be a ghost standing behind her sister.

'To our shock this figure which looks like a man appeared in one of them. We got a chill sensation and just screamed "oh my god."
'It was a creepy moment. My sister was petrified. She was going on about how he was standing right behind her. Then she thought it was pretty cool. It's pretty scary stuff. There was no one else there.'
The 'spectral figure' which photobombed Emma's picture is stood directly behind her sister wearing what appears to be a long coat and boots. She believes it may be a ghost known as 'The Watcher' or 'Mr Boots.'
Emma said: 'There are a lot of stories about a man down there who wears big boots and a coat and another called "The Watcher" with long hair and 18th century clothing. It's weird that my sister was standing there behind him.. She was pretty creeped out at first.'

The Edinburgh vaults are a series of chambers formed in the arches of the South Bridge which were completed in 1788.
For around 30 years, the vaults were used to house tradesmen, and as a storage facility for illicit material, reportedly including the bodies of people killed by serial killers Burke and Hare for medical experiments.
As the conditions in the vaults deteriorated, due to damp and poor air quality, the businesses left and the poorest of Edinburgh's citizens moved in. But by around 1820 they are even believed to have left, too.
That people had lived there was only discovered in 1985 during an excavation when toys, medicine bottles, plates, and other signs of human habitation were found.
It was a creepy moment. My sister was petrified. She was going on about how he was standing right behind her
Emma Surgenor
Due to frequent reports of paranormal activity and ghost sightings, the Edinburgh vaults were featured on Living TV's Most Haunted. The vaults were monitored in both a 24-hour investigation and for a Most Haunted Live show on Halloween 2006, in which Scottish Investigator Ryan O'Neill took part.
Another television programme, Ghost Adventures, also filmed a show in the vaults and claimed to have experienced numerous encounters with spirits.
The Watcher or Mr Boots has apparently been seen by hundreds of visitors, with some reports describing him as tall with no eyes, a full beard, a long coat and big thigh-high boots.
Others suggest he watches visitors from the corridor and can be protective of the wall in one of the smaller vaults, sometimes shouting 'get out,' when people go near it.
Emma added: 'I have been down there a few times in the past and got another picture last year of a hand behind this guy. It was pretty creepy down there.  This time I didn't feel creeped out. There was no chill feeling when I took it or anything like that.
'I have another picture taken two seconds before and after where my sister isn't in the doorway and from the same angle and there is nothing there.
'It was so creepy but then we were chuffed we had found something. But it was a real shock that made your hair stand on end.'

Mum makes him strip down to his underpants in the porch even if weve got visitors.
And though Carlys mum Tina is Italian and Carly is bilingual there were no opera buffs in the family. None of us have any idea where my passion has come from, she says.
But from as long ago as they can remember they just couldnt stop me singing.
At school, her teachers spotted her potential and suggested she have singing lessons, which she started when she was eight.
With her sights on the West End stage, she applied to the Arts Educational School in Hertfordshire, alma mater of Downton actresses Jessica Brown Findlay and Lily James, who was in her class.
After the school principal invited a guest from The Royal Northern College of Music to the end-of-year show, Carly was offered a place on the spot.
She graduated in vocal studies four years later, aged 23, and got a job teaching at her old dance school, supplementing her income with private performances at weddings and corporate events.
The latter brought her lucky break. Carlys voice  and no doubt her easy-on-the-eye looks  caught the attention of luxury Swiss watch company Bedat &amp; Co, who signed her up as a brand ambassador.

That association, in turn, brought her to the attention of the 16-time Grammy Award wining record producer David Foster who helped launched the careers of Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.
Last September, he asked Carly to perform at his glitzy charity gala in Calgary, Canada, where she shared the bill with Aerosmiths Steven Tyler.
Two months later, she was invited to perform at the International Womens Media Foundation awards, hosted by Hudson.
To crown her memorable year, she will take to the stage at the Teatro dellOpera Di Roma, where she will sing solo and with Cynthia Lawrence, the American soprano who was Pavarottis favourite female artist.
The comparisons to Katherine Jenkins are inevitable, but Carly says: Were actually quite different. I like to think I am creating a new sound and I hope when the public gets to know me theyll see that.
Either way, there is little doubt that if they dont know it already, music lovers will soon know her name very well indeed.

	At the club's AGM in London, just 50.5 per cent of members voted in favour of  allowing women to join the club - falling short of the two-thirds majority needed for rules to be changed.

'I think women will do a lot for the good sense of the club,' he said.
But one member, who voted against the motion, said allowing women to join would threaten the 'camaraderie' and 'banter' members enjoy.

Women are allowed into the Garrick, which is situated in the heart of London's West End, as guests of members but there are parts of the building where they are not permitted.
Over the last 25 years, there have been a number of attempts to update the rules, with some fearing that the club gives its influential members unfair opportunities to network and develop relationships.
In 1991, broadcaster Melvyn Bragg - who last year hosted his 75th birthday celebrations at the gentlemen's club - was one of those who supported female members in a debate on the issue.
Speaking out: Labour MP Chris Bryant was among those who criticised the vote against allowing women
But he failed to convince the majority of members, and 70 per cent voted against allowing women.
Two decades later, women were nominated as prospective members for the first time in the club's history. Actress and activist Joanna Lumley was put forward by Hugh Bonneville, while broadcaster Lucinda Lambton was nominated by her husband SirPeregrine Worsthorne.
While a close examination of the rules revealed there was nothing preventing women from joining, it was decided that it would go against the spirit of the club and their applications were rejected.
That same year, Britain's most senior woman judge, Baroness Hale of Richmond, slammed the 'cosy club' enjoyed by her male colleagues.
Changing tides: Over the last 25 years, there have been a number of attempts to update the rules, with some fearing that the club gives its influential members unfair opportunities to network. Above, the Garrick Club
Baroness Hale, the only woman in the Supreme Court, said: 'I regard it as quite shocking that so many of my colleagues belong to the Garrick Club, but they don't see what all the fuss is about.'
She also told an InterLaw Diversity Forum, at London law firm Norton Rose, that the culture at the club was a key factor in why women did not make the top judicial ranks.
This was because there were 'too many systemic barriers' put in place that depended more on 'personal network relationships'.
Among those who spoke out against the 'no' vote today was Labour MP Chris Bryant, who called the decision 'extraordinary'.
Posting on Twitter, he wrote: 'Extraordinary that the Garrick Club still can't bring itself to admit women members'.
A spokeswoman for the Garrick Club said there would be no comment on the vote.

After 35 years of mangling the English language in his films, Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger has claimed that he can speak perfect English after all.
And he says he only sticks with his barely penetrable Austrian intonations because its what his fans expect.
Its now become such a big part of me, the accent, that people really enjoy it, explained the 67-year-old, whose latest movie Terminator Genisys opens in Britain on Thursday.
Perfect English: Arnold Schwarzenegger says he keeps his accent as fans expect it
He said that he could speak unaccented English if I need to but added: The very things that they said would make it impossible for me to be successful in acting were the things that became my assets, referring to his name, his voice and his physique.

	Samuel Price and Elizabeth Sandlin weren't exactly a couple. They were a pair of attractive twentysomethings who, over the course of a year, met up now and again for sex with each other.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
In this modern age, a purely physical and non-emotional relationship like this is supposed to be a sophisticated answer to servicing basic needs.
Yet after a night together went wrong on Valentines Day last year, the failings in the practice defeated the advantages of the theory.
Price, 24, has been landed with a criminal conviction for assault after Sandlin, 20, complained to police about the roughness of the sex they had together.
On the night in question, they met up late in the evening after both had been drinking at separate functions: he at a wedding, she at a nightclub.
During sex in his bedroom at his familys luxury farmhouse outside Chester, Price had pulled Sandlins hair and bit her on the thigh and bottom, leaving bruises.
In his court defence, he said that rough and playful sex had always been part of their relationship.
He has apologised and was horrified when he saw photographs of her two bruises  but Sandlin was not to be placated.
I trusted someone I should not have trusted. He was very drunk, blind drunk. He completely overstepped the mark. I was shocked, she said.
Today, however, the one who is truly shocked is Samuel Price, who cannot believe he now has a conviction.
And, to be honest, neither can I.
Yet this case is part of a growing trend, just another unhappy statistic in a week when it was revealed that convictions for violence against women have reached a record high.
Domestic abuse cases account for 14 per cent of all prosecutions going through the courts.
Nearly 100,000 criminal cases were launched against abusive partners last year, with a record 68,601 successful convictions.
Of course, much of this is to be hugely welcomed. A broadening of the definition of domestic abuse to include offences such as revenge porn and coercive control is a step in the right direction.
Record numbers of men being prosecuted for violent crimes against women, including rape and so-called honour-based violence, can only be viewed as a positive step.
Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, has urged police and prosecutors to take crimes against women more seriously, while changes in the law have made it easier to prosecute men for domestic abuse.
New guidelines encourage the system to be more open-minded and consider that victims of domestic abuse are not just the stereotypical battered wife.
They are women, perhaps, like Elizabeth Sandlin. Aggrieved after a night out went wrong and not ashamed to push for her partner to be punished.
Domestic abuse was once a dirty secret, a shame that had to be borne in private by a battered wife or a violated girlfriend.
Im glad those days have gone, but I worry that the mania for feminising the law  for whittling and shaping it to suit the concerns of noisy pressure groups  is resulting in skewing justice too far in the other direction.
In the Price/Sandlin case, if rough sex was an integral part of their relationship, then it must have been consensual.
Clearly on this particular night, matters went beyond what she expected or felt comfortable with, but he was in her words, blind drunk.
Perhaps she might have asked herself why she went to bed with someone who was so clearly out of control?
Prices judgment was blurred  but so was hers. However, while she can use drink as an excuse, he cannot, because drunkenness can never be a defence for violence, even if it was unintended.
Jan Moir says in the Price/Sandlin case, if rough sex was an integral part of their relationship, then it must have been consensual (pictured: Miss Sandlin's bruises)
Yet from the unpromising beginnings of an alcohol-fuelled tryst that went awry, Elizabeth Sandlin wasted no time in going on to try to criminalise her sex-pal and claim victim status for herself. My worry is that the DPP, while encouraging justice officials to look for victims in the unlikeliest places, is going to make it too easy for an aggrieved partner to take to the courts on a whim.
Meanwhile, pornography is readily available and books such as the Fifty Shades Of Grey quartet normalise sadistic sex to the extent that housewives hold S&amp;M-themed tea parties, complete with whip-shaped eclairs.
All this is confusing for young men and women  but especially for men.
Elizabeth Sandlin may have received justice for her bruises, but should this case ever have been brought?
Sensible women dont jump into bed with men for a sex assignation, then complain if they dont behave like Prince Charming.
Sensible women would develop a trusting relationship with a man before taking it to a more intimate level. But sense and perspective never seem to have a place in the sex wars.
Where are we going from here? Perhaps women will start to bring criminal charges if they dont get full sexual satisfaction on demand.

DECENCY IS DYING JUST A LITTLE MORE EVERY DAY
Sometimes the world seems to take two steps forward and then six steps back. It is the casual lack of humanity and common decency that is so killing. Like the heroin addict travellers who were invited for tea by a couple in their 90s, then proceeded to rob them as the wife was baking them scones.
In West London, a woman and her 16-year-old daughter committed suicide by holding hands and jumping in front of a train.
Horror in the rush-hour? Not quite. Some on the platform viewed the tragedy as not much more than an interesting distraction on their commute. Train staff had to broadcast repeated requests for passengers to stop photographing the bodies. Selfies, too? I dont doubt it.
Meanwhile, a former Sunday school teacher stole an antique toast rack from an Alzheimers sufferer and a coat from a partially blind lady while working as a carer.
Then two British schoolboys, supposedly on an educational trip to understand the horrors of World War II, were accused of stealing artefacts from Auschwitz. Perhaps they thought they could flog em on the internet?
What has happened to our morals? Pity we cant buy them on eBay, too.

Poor The Queen! On her tour of Germany, HM was presented with a painting that looked as if it had been produced by a ham-fisted mass murderer in a high-security art class.

The Queen left bewildered by stylised German painting
Is that supposed to be my father? she asked, peering at the picture titled Horse In Royal Blue.
No wonder she was confused, considering he had no ankles and appeared to be wearing a pair of plus-fours that had been blown up by bellows. No, I dont think its going to be hanging in the drawing room at Windsor any time soon.

BRADBY IS TV'S MR SMUG
In a U.S.-style shake-up of its flagship nightly news programme, ITV is turning the News At Ten into a star vehicle for smoothie-chops Tom Bradby.
The TV station bosses are labouring under the delusion that Bradby is incredibly popular with viewers, when perhaps the truth is that he is only incredibly popular with himself.
To be honest, I suspect most viewers find TB too glossy and self-satisfied in the brisk news environment.

In addition, he always looks as if he secretly dresses like Prince George when no one is looking. On the professional front, he is not as good a political editor as the BBCs Nick Robinson and hes not as good an anchorman as Mark Austin, whom he is replacing.
Meanwhile, ITV can expect stiff resistance to throwing showbiz razzmatazz at their news bulletins.
As far as British audiences are concerned, its all about the swirling currents, the stricken ship and what is looming on the horizon. It is never, ever about the anchor.

If you think eating bowls of cereal while driving in the middle lane is fine, dont move to Spain. A driver in Salamanca has been fined 60 for biting his nails. The man was caught by the Guardia Civil mid-morning and his fine notice states he was driving without maintaining proper freedom of movement because he was biting his nails while at the wheel.It is not known whether the driver intends to appeal  but who will be attracted to him, with his chewed fingernails, air of distraction and police record?

PUT HER IN QUARANTINE, JOHNNY
What is it with Amber Heard, the poor mans Scarlett Johansson? She is one of those annoying wives who take on the mantle of their husbands professional status, even when richly undeserved.
Indeed, marriage to Hollywood royalty Johnny Depp has made Amber behave like a preening queen of the screen, with a sense of entitlement way beyond her standing as the star of Drop Dead Sexy, Machete Kills and the new male stripper movie, Magic Mike XXL.
Le Grande Empress Amber has proclaimed that she and her husband will boycott Australia after a government minister threatened to have their dogs Pistol and Boo put down for flouting quarantine regulations.
I have a feeling were going to avoid the land Down Under from now on, just as much as we can, thanks to certain politicians there, simmered Amber.
What is it with Amber Heard, the poor mans Scarlett Johansson? She is one of those annoying wives who take on the mantle of their husbands professional status, even when richly undeserved
Poor Australia! An entire nation reels.
The couple were accused of unlawfully smuggling the dogs into Oz on a private plane last month, while Depp was filming the latest Pirates Of The Caribbean movie there.
Barnaby Joyce, an outspoken government minister, threatened to have the dogs killed, and declared there could not be another law for movie stars and their pets.
Australia has some of the strictest quarantine rules in the world  for a very good reason obvious to everyone except pampered movie stars. But Amber can only see the world in terms of the effect she is having on others.
Never mind the danger to the Australian ecosystem from her potentially germ-bomb teacup dogs, she blamed Mr Joyce for being a brute and trying to claim his 15 minutes of fame at her expense.
Johnny is saying nothing. Maybe he never even wanted to go back to Australia. But knowing the Aussies as we do, I doubt that either of them will be very welcome.

Mr Ahmed denied any knowledge of the video, which was posted on Instagram but later deleted.
A HSBC spokesperson said: 'We do not tolerate inappropriate behaviour.
'We took the decision to sack the individuals involved. This is an abhorrent video and HSBC would like to apologise for any offence caused.'
It is understood the film was made when the men were on a team-building exercise at a go kart track
The workers' video is the latest scandal for HSBC, which earlier this year was accused of helping rich clients avoid tax and turning a blind eye to arms dealers.
On the 'Our Values' page of its website, HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver says: 'By setting the highest standards of behavior our aim is that all of our employees and customers can be proud of our business.'
The bank's customers and Twitter users slammed the stunt online today, branding it 'utter, utter idiocy'.
Ben Rose tweeted: 'That HSBC mock ISIS beheading. Supposed educated individuals. Bunch of absolute morons more like.'
And another user added: 'HSBC only sacked those 'ISIS' goons because the film was made public. Imagine what goes on in private at that place.'
ISIS has used its carefully-produced propaganda videos to recruit extremists from around the world to its cause.
Six staff from HSBC (whose Birmingham building is pictured, left) have been sacked after filming the video
The horrific footage of the beheadings of US and British hostages featuring the killer known-as 'Jihadi John' were designed to cause maximum shock around the world.
Hostages were put in orange jumpsuits in a perverse reference to inmates at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where high-risk terrorists were imprisoned by the US authorities.
The videos were spread through social media and YouTube in a bid to attract radicals from around the world to their side.
It is not the first time the propaganda videos have been recreated for poor-taste jokes. Earlier this year, actress Dakota Johnson was criticised for filming an ISIS-themed skit for US show Saturday Night Live.
The sequence poked fun at a Toyota advert, but showed Johnson jumping into the back of an ISIS jeep. The sketch was slammed as 'depraved' and 'tasteless' by viewers.

Another wrote on Facebook: 'All of the staff were surrounding them. Poor people must have been so desperate to do something like that.
'It was so scary they were sitting by a tree and the other one legged it out the school gates. It's really bad not feeling safe in your on school. He could have been anywhere. Glad to hear he's been caught'.
Police said today they had arrested the men on suspicion of illegal entry to the UK and they are currently in custody before being handed over to the Home Office.
Response: News of the incident, and the arrests, spread across social media locally, which led to eyewitness accounts from students and parents
Presdales is a girls secondary school and sixth form college, which was once attended by pop star Kim Wilde, Paul Gascoigne's daughter Bianca and former Eastenders' actress Kacey Ainsworth, who played Little Mo.
A Hertfordshire Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to Presdales School to reports three men were seen to emerge from a bus which had returned from France.
One of the men ran off whilst two others were detained by members of the public.
'Officers attended and searched the area and located the third man, all were arrested on suspicion of illegal entry to the UK.
'The men, who are 19, 23 and 28 years old, are believed to be from Sudan. The men remain in custody and the matter has been passed to immigration enforcement officials'.
It came just two days after two illegal migrants snuck into another  luggage compartment of a coach full of young children coming home from a school trip.
The pair were spotted crawling out from among suitcases as shocked parents came to collect their kids.

Athens yesterday extended its 'bank holiday' until at least Thursday after the European Central Bank deferred a decision on whether to continue propping up the country's financial institutions.
But one American hedge fund, Balyasny, yesterday warned investors that Greek banks were on the verge of running dry, leaving the country 48 hours from civil unrest.

Greece remains in economical crisis as banks stay closed
In a further signal that Greece's financial woes could spark a wider geopolitical crisis for the West, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras yesterday held talks by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Moscow said the call had been arranged 'at the request' of Mr Tsipras, with the two men discussing the outcome of the referendum. Some observers believe Moscow could agree to bail out Greece in return for Athens blocking further EU sanctions against Russia.
France was last night pushing for an EU brokered deal, with Mr Hollande saying it was vital to Europe to show 'solidarity' with Greece.
The French President said 'the door is open' to further discussions with Mr Tsipras, who is expected to table fresh proposals in Brussels today.
But Germany gave no sign it is willing to back down in the face of the Greek referendum on Sunday, when voters overwhelmingly rejected the austerity measures demanded as a condition of future bailout funds.

Mrs Merkel said the conditions for a deal 'are not there yet'. She added: 'We have already shown a great deal of solidarity to Greece and the latest proposal put forward to them was extremely generous.'
Sigmar Gabriel, the German vice-chancellor and economy minister, said there could be no question of writing off Greek debt because other countries that have had loans such as Ireland, Portugal and Spain would demand equal treatment.
'I really hope that the Greek government  if it wants to enter negotiations again  will accept that the other 18 member states of the euro can't just go along with an unconditional haircut,' he said.
'How could we then refuse it to other member states? And what would it mean for the eurozone if we'd do it? It would blow the eurozone apart, for sure.'
In the UK, ministers are pessimistic about the prospects for a deal.
David Cameron held talks by phone with Mrs Merkel on the crisis, while George Osborne discussed the issue with International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde. But neither man emerged from the discussions with any indication that a deal is imminent.

In the Commons, Mr Osborne said there was now a severe danger that the political talks would be overtaken by the financial realities on the ground.
The Chancellor said the chances of a 'happy resolution' were 'sadly diminished' by Sunday's 'No' vote in Greece.
He said the crisis would 'deteriorate rapidly' unless today's eurozone meeting signals that a deal is on the cards.
Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice president responsible for the euro, said a write-down of Greece's 270 billion debt mountain was now 'off the table' after the referendum.
He said the vote 'dramatically weakens the negotiating stance of the Greek government' and 'makes things more complicated'.
At a briefing in Brussels, he added: 'The 'No' result unfortunately widens the gap between Greece and other eurozone countries. There is no easy way out of this crisis. Too much time and too many opportunities have been lost.' Mr Dombrovskis also claimed the vote had no legal basis.

'We choose democracy!': Greece celebrates a 'no' referendum
Pressure on Greece's banks last night increased as the European Central Bank toughened the terms of its emergency funding.
The ECB demanded Greeks banks put up more collateral in order to keep the 89 billion euro lifeline of Emergency Liquidity Assistance.
Even though the country's four main banks are expected to meet the new threshold, the decision pushes them closer to the brink as they struggle to replenish cash machines.
Global stock markets slid lower yesterday as the result of the Greek referendum. Shares across Europe tumbled and the single currency was hammered amid speculation Greece is on the verge of leaving the euro and readopting the drachma.
Britain's blue chip companies have now lost 145billion of value since April in a blow to millions of families with savings and pensions.
But holidaymakers heading to the Continent are getting more bang for their buck thanks to the rising value of the pound. Sterling rose as high to above 1.41 euros  up more than 12 per cent on a year ago when 1 was worth less than 1.26 euros.

Tory eurosceptics have urged British voters to follow Greece's lead in standing up to EU 'bullying'.
Steve Baker, who leads the Conservatives for Britain campaign, said Greek's referendum should encourage Britons to 'be courageous and vote in line with what they think best when the referendum comes'.
He added that we have a 'much stronger economy' and therefore are 'much more able to depart from the EU' than Greece.

	The Labour MP for Rochdale and his estranged wife - known for her Twitter selfies - have been locked in a very public spat since they split up earlier this year

He has worked to shed light on the crimes of former MP Cyril Smith in his constituency of Rochdale and has put pressure on the Home Office to do more to investigate historic crimes..
He said yesterday: 'It has made me depressed and I have decided to seek help. I've been getting angry at stuff I shouldn't be getting angry at, fairly mundane things, and have been aggressive - not violently aggressive - but getting angry about things.
'I've been drinking too much, a full bottle of wine of an evening,especially on Fridays when I would hear a lot and meet with a number of the victims. At times suicidal thoughts as well.'
Mr Danczuk said he felt'like a fool' for not suspecting after Karen started wearing make-up and skimpy kit to the gym, pictured is Karen with her trainer, Ben Bate
Karen Danczuk became known for posting racy Twitter images
He said his mental health had impacted his relationship as he had trouble sleeping and his wife had understandable become sick of hearing about child sex abuse.
He added: 'On a practical level, Karen would say why don't we not talk about this tonight, can we have a night off talking about child sexual abuse.
'Because I would be coming home some nights wanting to download some of what I had heard. Not everyone wants to listen to it, do they, quite understandably.'
He continued: 'We would go out as a couple with another couple which was relatively rare and my wife went to the toilet. When she came back she said; "What you guys talking about?" And of course, we're speaking about child sex abuse.'
The 48-year-old politician said he sought help through a parliamentary occupation health officer and he is now seeing a therapist.
His interview came after Mrs Danczuk, 32, told her 61,000 followers on Twitter that 'word is now out' that she is single and posted a screen grab of an internet dating site.

Last week, Mr Danczuk voiced fears that his wife had been cheating on him with her personal trainer for five months after Ben Bate, 33, was photographed leaving the couple's home at 5am on Friday.
And the 'selfie queen'  hit back saying she is 'disgusted' by his comments and vowing that the 'truth will out'.
Karen tweeted: 'I'm disgusted by the Suns story. Pure lies! I know truth, he knows truth! KD #alcoholic #arrogant #badtemper #goodwithhis..... #truthwillout.'
Her husband said it was 'clear' Karen and Mr Bate  had a close relationship and said he felt 'like a fool' for not suspecting after Karen started wearing make-up and skimpy kit to the gym.
The MP for Rochdale, 48, said her gym sessions went from once a week to every day and last month theyspent five days together in Spain last month at a boot camp near Alicante.
Mr Danczuk said: 'I would call Karen in the morning and she wouldn't answer at 10am. It was also hard to get hold of her at night.'
Putting on a brave face:Simon Danczuk posted this picture to Twitter over the weekend
Warning: Ms Danczuk posted this racy photo and message to Twitter on Friday
Mrs Danczuk announced her marriage to the Labour MP was over last week and on Friday night Mr Bate revealed on Twitter that he had separated from his wife Natalie.
Mr Bate, who fled to the hills to take part in the Three Peaks Challenge, tweeted:  'FYI I'm separated... me and @KarenDanczuk are friends. When two friends have gone through separation it's good to talk.'
Mrs Danczuk has said to point out that her personal trainer's marriage broke down in May.
She tweeted: 'One final point re: my PT and this is last word. His marriage broke down way back in May so not just last few days so sorry to disappoint.'
The former councillor again denied the rumours last night, saying: 'I don't fancy him  he's not very easy on the eye.'
She was seen taking her two sons to the cinema yesterday to watch the new Minions film.
Karen referred to her personal trainer as a 'great friend' and she she might as well have cheated because of the accusations.

The MoD said it backed the soldier and that members of the public should show respect towards guardsmen.
Clad in their distinctive red tunics and bearskins hats, the soldiers of the Queens Guard are charged with protecting official royal residences.
'Get back'! The guard yells at the man as he touches him, immediately wiping the grin off his face
Armed: The soldier - charged with protecting royal residencies - points his rifle at the man, who has already scarpered
Back to work: Ever the professional, the guardsman places his gun back on his shoulder and continues his march
The units, manned by fully-trained, serving soldiers, have more than 350 years of history and have defended monarchs since Charles II took the throne after the English Restoration in 1660.
There are thought to be guidelines in place for guardsmen to deal with nuisances, which begins with stamping their feet and shouting.
Raising a rifle is considered a 'final warning', after which the guardsmen is allowed to detain the person in question.
Earlier this month, another tourist was left embarrassed after a confrontation with the Queen's Guard.
Gerry Weatherhead, 58, a retired RAF engineer from Haverhill in Suffolk, was barged out of the path of a troop of marching guardsmen outside Buckingham Palace.

Hilarious moment Queen's Guards push 'stupid' tourist out the way
Oblivious to the soldiers, Mr Weatherhead was caught on video chatting to his wife as the men approached him at speed, shoving him out of the way as they marched through.
Following the collision the video shows the unconcerned soldier continuing to march while a loud military voice bellowed at Mr Weatherhead: 'Make way!'
A woman's voice can then be heard jeering: 'Stupid man!'
The video was shot during Trooping the Colour in central London to mark the Queen's official birthday.

	Zoe Appleyard-Ley on being violated by the live-in nanny who looted my life
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3141769/Violated-live-nanny-looted-life-chilling-warning-trusting-families-mother-cruelly-betrayed-duplicitous-thief-welcomed-home.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490
      </Link>
        <Description>
	Zoe Appleyard-Ley's former nanny, 45-year-old Emma Currie, was jailed for stealing £900 from her after vanishing in her car with a loot of her most prized possessions.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>1 silver spoon
1 suitcase
I started to make a hurried inventory of what was missing. A friend drew my attention to the emptied coat cupboard and it turned out that not just obvious things had gone missing. Can you remember everything in your house and where you left it?
It was only when I saw what was in the car when I collected it from Crawley police station, with no ID to prove I was me, that I understood the full extent of what had been taken. Places we had not even thought to look for missing items had clearly been targeted too.
That sense of cruel violation is something I hope few people will ever experience. However, as with any bad event, you get over it for your own sake and also for the sake of your children. You retain your belief in justice and want them to understand that justice does exist so you do everything you can to help the police in their investigation and of course you accept youll have to be a witness for the CPS.
Currie then jumped bail and went on the run, failing to turn up for her first court hearing. When she was finally caught and brought before a jury, I soon realised that a criminal trial can be even more traumatic than the crime itself.
Possessions can be replaced, but when someone sets out to destroy you publicly you are blind-sided. I was shocked that she could be capable of such cruelty. Suddenly everything was at stake.
I did not discover until the trial that, when Currie was arrested in my car near Gatwick Airport with my passport beside her, she had immediately started lying to cover her tracks. I was astounded to find out that the reason she gave for having been in Victoria Station was to deliver my dry cleaning to Jeeves of Belgravia. There is no Jeeves there and CCTV footage showed her without any dry cleaning.
Worse still, she exaggerated heinous lies she had told to social services in August 2013 and began to make up wild and unfounded allegations about me and my family. Until that moment, I had not realised that the British criminal justice system allowed criminals open season to ruin the lives of their victims by tarnishing their reputation and smearing their character without any effective right of reply.
If criminals are so inclined, they can stop at nothing, they can say anything they want. In court there are no holds barred. The oath to them means nothing. It does not matter that innocent and already violated children will be traumatised still further.
The things I was accused of were, to say the least, colourful.
As soon as I was called to the witness box, I realised that I was defenceless. I had no legal representation or say in what had been presented to the jury.
I was to answer only the questions I was asked and was unable even to whisper to friends the full facts. I had no forum in the witness box to state what really happened for fear of being held in contempt of court.
It did not seem to matter that Westminster Social Services had investigated Curries evil allegations and judged them to be false and malicious, or that their report was at the disposal of the prosecutor and had been submitted to the defence counsel from the outset  which, begrudgingly, she had to admit to the judge at the end of the trial.
Betrayed: Mrs Appleyard-Ley wants to share her experience in the hope of informing other parents
No one elects to be a victim of crime. You have no choice if you are summoned to appear as a witness for the CPS. But as a witness, your interests are not necessarily aligned with those of the CPS. It is not their job to defend you.
Indeed, collateral damage to the victim is of no interest to the CPS, even if they are hurt far more viciously in the pursuit of justice than in the original crime. Indeed, you do not actually realise that the prosecutor may have only been given the case that morning, and can even dismiss key witnesses not knowing what else they could independently verify.
THE 12 LESSONS I LEARNED...THE HARD WAY
1. Do rigorous background checks and insist on speaking to all previous employers.
2. Install video cameras in your house
3. Keep a credit card hidden, so you can get cash if your purse is stolen.
4. Be prepared for further violations upon your reputation in court, even if they are lies.
5. Make copious notes and put everything you can possibly think of in police statements. Keep copies.
6. Ask anyone who can corroborate your version of events to write detailed notes that include your reactions and make sure the police take statements.
7. Re-live the days before, during and immediately after the crime; think of everything, speak to people who were around you  they might remember something you dont.
8. Be prepared to be in shock at being in the same room as the criminal  I left the Old Bailey crying.
9. You will realise who your absolute best friends are
10. Try to keep your trauma away from your children
11. If you can, read out your Victim Impact Statement yourself. It will help in getting any restraining orders you might rightfully deserve.
12. It really is now time to move on and never mention this womans name again
Meanwhile the defence counsel will have been working in close collaboration with the criminal for weeks or even months.
I understand Currie went through three legal teams in two years. Unlike the criminal, the victim has been given no briefing or training for how to deal with the witness box experience (its awful), or expectation of what they may face in cross examination  however irrelevant to the charges under consideration.
Your inquisitors come across as cool and collected, you can look like a car-wreck.
Even worse, anything you may have said or done in your life may be twisted and used against you while the track record and previous bad character of the criminal must apparently be withheld from the jury  even if that includes, as it did in Curries case, jumping bail, going on the run from the police and apparently even performing a remarkably similar theft on a vulnerable elderly lady taking her car, heirlooms, silver and her beloved pet dog.
Until I appeared as a witness, I had never realised that victims of crime and witnesses are often treated worse in our courts than the criminals themselves.
The rules must be changed to stop criminals like Currie further abusing their victims while the court stands silent, as they do so. I have also come to believe that victims and witnesses should be given anonymity in cases where their private home and children are involved. At the very least, reporting restrictions should apply.
I hope my story will not discourage anyone from employing people to help them at home. Its often a matter of necessity, rather than choice. There must be thousands of people with small children or aged relatives who thank God daily for the help they receive from carers, house-helps, baby-sitters and nannies. For them, a world where you never let another person inside your home is not realistic.
However, my ordeal is a wake-up call that you need to be very careful about whom you place your trust in. Leave no stone unturned in your background checks. You need to know everything to make a proper evaluation of the risk.
And in my opinion the DBS check is not worth the paper it is written on (unless, of course, it actually shows a criminal conviction). Most thefts end up as a crime reference number, not a prosecution.
At one stage Curries barrister tried to get her a suspended sentence by blaming me for placing an inappropriate level of trust in her.
Until Emma-Jane Currie was finally convicted, I was in many ways the accused.

	Annie Richards, of Cradley Heath, West Midlands, was denied access to the toilet in a Plymouth branch of Co-op Food despite telling staff of her condition, which causes excruciating abdominal pain

'I rarely go out, which is why it was devastating to be treated so cruelly by the Co-op. I'd had a lovely weekend, and it really knocked my confidence.
'Now I'm worried to even go out in case I have another accident.'
She says a member of staff ignored her pleas to be able to use the staff toilet. The company has apologised
Following the embarrassing incident, Ms Richards posted an angry comment on the Co-operative Food's Facebook page but the company failed to respond.
She said: 'I was really disappointed when no-one got back to me. I feel like much more needs to be done to educate people on the effects of Crohn's.
'Whilst I can accept that it might not be store policy to allow members of the public to use staff toilets, I would hope that people would use their common sense.
'I was clearly in a lot of pain, and as someone who used to work in a supermarket, I know I would never treat someone in that way.
'People need to understand that we're not exaggerating when we say we need the toilet. Hopefully companies will also teach their staff about the 'Can't Wait' cards so they can respond more appropriately in the future.'
Ms Richards is currently planning to complete a skydive in aid of the 'GetYourBellyOut' campaign, which was set up to raise awareness of Crohn's and colitis.
Ms Richards, left, after an a operation to remove part of her intestine and, right, with her son Cory
She said: 'I won't let what happened stop me from living my life. I want to help other people with the condition to know that they are not alone and there is nothing to be ashamed of.'
Caroline Reed, Membership Manager at Crohn's and Colitis UK, said: 'For many people with inflammatory bowel disease, the sudden and uncontrollable need to use a toilet is a genuine and recognised symptom of their condition.
'Having an 'accident' in public can have a devastating effect on their ability to undertake everyday activities, such as going to work, shopping and socialising.
'We hope that in the future staff members will be more sensitive to members of the public with 'invisible' diseases.'
A spokesperson for The Co-operative Food said: 'For health, safety and insurance reasons staff toilets are not generally available to customers, but their use by customers is left to the discretion of the store team.
'We are sorry to hear about this incident and as a gesture of goodwill we will make a donation of 100 to a local Colitis and Crohn's Disease Association charity.'
CROHN'S DISEASE: AN INFLAMMATION OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM'S LINING
Suffferers of Crohn's disease include The Only Way is Essex star Sam Faiers
Crohns disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.
Inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon).
Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon.
It isnt fully understood what causes the condition but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role.
There is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system.
One theory is that Crohn's, whose sufferers include Towie star Sam Faiers (right) is caused by the immune system attacking healthy bacteria in the gut.
So by giving the patient a new immune system - through a bone marrow transplant - it is hoped that the disease can be cured.
To have a bone marrow transplant, stem cells are removed, high-dose chemotherapy is given to suppress the immune system - and stem cells are then returned.
There are currently at least 115,000 people living with Crohns disease in the UK.Crohn's disease can affect people of all ages, including children.
However, most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30.

	The pair were estranged for years after Jade's mother walked out on the 49-year-old when Jade was a baby.

'Jade's a lovely girl and she seems really happy with the house,' one neighbour, who did not want to be named, told The Sun .
Evans has described 'not being around enough' for Jade when she was a baby, claiming he was too focused on his career at the time to devote enough attention to his child and her mother.
Happy families: The BBC Radio host walked Jade down the aisle in 2013 after reuniting with his firstborn
Chequered past: Evans labelled himself 'selfish' in his treatment of Alison Ward, Jade's mother and his former fiancee (left). He moved on from the pair to marry Carole McGiffin in 1991 (right)
Alison Ward, Jade's mother and the DJ's former fiance, left him when she was still an infant.
Describing their parting in his autobiography, Evans said: 'Alison was totally selfless when it came to my ambition but I simply wasn't around enough to be supportive of her in the far more important task of bringing up a young child - in short, I was a selfish p****'.
'I came back to the house one day and Alison had had enough  she had gone back to her mums with the baby.
'What did I feel at the time? Im ashamed to say relief. I saw Alison going back home as leaving me free to carry on chasing my dreams, but thats where my head was at the time.'
The presenter and his former fiance became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute which was resolved in 1998, when Jade was 11, with Evans agreeing to a financial settlement.
Many loves: Evans went on to marry Billie Piper in a 200 Las Vegas ceremony. The pair divorced in 2007
He had, up until then, been paying maintenance to Ward, it was reported at the time.
Evans went on to marry former Loose Women star CaroleMcGiffin (they divorced in 1998, four years after separating and after seven years of marriage) before tying the knot with Billie Piper in a 200 Las Vegas ceremony in 2001.They divorced in 2007.
He married his third wife, Natasha Shishmanian, the same year. The pair have two sons together.
Third time lucky: Evans married Natasha Shishmanian in 2007. The couple (above in 2012) have two children together
Chris Evans to film secret Top Gear sequence
Earlier this year Evans gushed over becoming a grandfather to Jade's son, Teddy.
Announcing the happy news to his millions of Twitter followers, he said in January: ''Teddy Rupert is here!!! Everyone doing brilliantly. Congrats to Ma &amp; Pa, Alison and Wardy, Sandra and Gavin ! (sic)'.

'Out of the office and on the road, Jim was in his element. Insatiably curious and always charming, Jim has a knack of grabbing interviews in a corridor or lift you never thought you'd ever get.
'And all of it anchored by his ability as a writer for radio, second to none, always able to conjure up for the audience a sense of place - a US convention, a party conference, moving into Kosovo in a Land Rover, all of it rendered vividly for a generation of Today listeners.'
James Naughtie and John Humphries reading the papers for The Today Programme.The presenter - who once famously mis-pronounced the first letter of former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt's surname on air - was described as 'chaotically charming by his colleagues
He has also presented every edition of Radio 4's monthly Bookclub since it began in 1998
Naughtie is the second longest-serving presenter after John Humphrys.
The announcement has fueled speculation over who will replace him - with the BBCs political editor Nick Robinson hotly tipped to fill the slot, despite not being back on full duties following surgery for a rare form of lung cancer.
In a statement, the Corporation said: 'In this role he will have a responsibility for charting the course of the constitutional changes at the heart of the UK political debate - devolution and independence, parliamentary reform and the changes in the UK's relations with Europe.
'Jim will also be a roving reporter and Radio 4 listeners will continue to hear from him at home and around the world.
'He is also being appointed as BBC News Books Editor. This will chiefly involve working for Radio 4, where he will present a regular book review for the Today programme on a Saturday morning.'
Mr Naughtie said: 'It was exciting to discover that the BBC and I had the same idea about what I should do next. I'm thrilled to be moving from one dream job to another, and working with the programmes across Radio 4 - including Today - that I love and have known for so long.
'I can't think of a more invigorating challenge. And after 21 years, I can turn off that 3am alarm at last'.
James Naughtie joined Today in 1994 following the death of Brian Redhead, having spent six years as presenter of The World at One, where he succeeded Sir Robin Day.
In his 21 years on the programme he interviewed every significant figure in British politics and has travelled the world for Today - in Europe, the Middle East, China including Tibet, Australia and to the United States.
He interviewed Barack Obama at the start of his political rise, before his name was known across the Atlantic, and every British prime minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards.
He has presented every edition of Radio 4's monthly Bookclub since it began in 1998.
Tony Hall, Director-General of the BBC, says: 'Jim has been the emotional heart of the Today programme for a generation.
'His persistent and incisive questioning has given millions of listeners a greater understanding of the stories of our time. Above all he's a writer and reporter at heart - he can bring to life a vivid scene on the radio better than anyone - and I'm delighted that on many of the biggest news stories of 2016 and beyond Jim will continue to be at the heart of our coverage.

James Harding, Director of News, says: 'Jim brings a range of passions and interests, a host of intelligence and understanding to all that he does on the BBC. As a presenter of Today, he has illuminated the national conversation on politics and world affairs, the arts and culture for more than 20 years. I am excited at the prospect of Jim, unleashed, as inquisitor and reporter, critic and twinkling enthusiast across the Radio 4 airwaves for years to come.'
Gwyneth Williams, Controller of BBC Radio 4, adds: 'Jim has been a leading Radio 4 presenter for as long as I can remember and I want to thank him for his many years on Today.
'Our discerning audience trusts his judgement and we all respond to his inimitable enthusiasm and verve. His is an elegant pen and Jim has made good writing his signature. Thus I am thrilled to be keeping for Radio 4, in this broader role, his particular voice, with its rich understanding of politics and culture and history.'

He also gave her four Oyster travel passes worth 10 each and a London 2012 badge. She later remarked: He definitely wasnt very romantic when it came to gifts.
She was left heartbroken when Sir Peter dumped her after his wife Sue, 60, found out about their fling.
Sir Peter declined to comment about the affair, except to deny spending any public money on Miss Grundy.
He recently famously branded Britains commuter trains awful and like the Wild West. Yesterday, as he was put in charge of Britains rail network, there were plenty of long-suffering commuters hoping he may hold the ticket to making their daily journeys more comfortable.
Sir Peter, pictured, refused to comment on the affair, only to confirm that no public money was used

He has run Londons complex transport system since 2006. As Transport for Londons commissioner, he is credited with overseeing many improvements and his efforts resulted in a knighthood in 2013.
Sir Peter is familiar with the rail network outside the capital, too, having spent the past ten years travelling regularly between London and the 1.5million Georgian villa in Bath he shares with his wife, an HR consultant and the mother of his two children.
Unlike the squashed-in masses, however, the multi-millionaire enjoys free first class travel  a generous perk earned as a result of an earlier job as a London Transport manager. A colourful character, Sir Peter once took the Tube to work wearing slippers and an elaborate oriental silk dressing gown to help raise money for Comic Relief.
Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses at TfL total more than 650,000, is happy to emphasise his working-class credentials. He sometimes turned up to London Assembly meetings in a bus workers high-visibility jacket and loves to speak in a gravelly Cockney accent  to the amusement of his former classmates at a top public school, Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. And even though his father was a communist firebrand, his mother was the daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford.
The Honourable Mary Best ran away from her familys ancestral home in Dorset and married electrician Jack Hendy. A Communist Party activist and leading member of the Electrical Trades Union, he was caught up in a ballot-rigging scandal and, although cleared by the courts, was banned for life from the union. He studied for a law degree at night school and became a barrister.
Sir Peter has been keen to portray his career as a rags-to-riches rise from lowly London bus conductor to self-made millionaire and transport supremo.
But, having studied economics at Leeds University, he actually began in 1975 as a fast-track graduate trainee with London Transport, which involved a few weeks work experience as a conductor as well as learning how to drive a bus.
He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a 34million management buyout in 1995  and his stake was worth 4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for 54million.
Although appointed as commissioner by Red Ken Livingstone, a close ally, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson. At one point he concluded: Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken. He also noted: I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, Im not sure Im more Left-leaning than he is.
Did Tories cover up the rail crisis? Big projects halted weeks after party's election promises to spend billions on the network
By RAY MASSEY and DANIEL MARTIN
Ministers were accused of a pre-election cover-up last night after they announced bombshell plans to scale back rail improvements worth billions of pounds.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that rising costs and missed targets meant that the 38.5billion Network Rail modernisation plan  a centrepiece of the Tory manifesto only two months ago  was now untenable.
Two major electrification schemes in the North and the Midlands would be halted, he said, while wider spending plans would be amended after running out of control.
Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin told MPs that the Network Rail modernisation plan was 'untenable'
Labour questioned why the chaotic climbdown had been unveiled now  just seven weeks after the election  when the pledge to spend billions improving the transport network had been a key part of the Conservative offer.
MPs also accused the Government of shelving bad news until after the election, even though they had known for months that the plans were at risk. One said Tory MPs across the North had been elected under false pretences. Conservative backbenchers were also angry that projects were being scaled back while the controversial 50billion HS2 high-speed rail scheme linking London and Birmingham  which they decry as a white elephant  survives unscathed.
The climbdown is a disaster for the Government and its pledge to deliver a northern powerhouse. The idea  championed by George Osborne  was for improved transport links to bind together the cities of the North, which would be granted devolved power to allow them to boost their economies.
The Conservatives election manifesto had pledged: We will transform our railway network. We will invest 38billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme.
The decision to pull the plug on rail schemes in the North and the Midlands, while keeping HS2 and London projects such as Crossrail untouched, puts the Tories rhetoric in doubt. Mr McLoughlin told the Commons that the five-year rail improvement plan needed to be reset because it was now costing more and taking longer. He said electrification work was being paused on the Midland main line between London and Sheffield  where hundreds of millions has already been spent on preparatory work  and on the trans-Pennine Leeds-Manchester route.
The aim is to keep Network Rails spending within its funding allowance, so that electrification of the Great Western line can be prioritised. Mr McLoughlin announced a shake-up of Network Rail management with the chairman  and former Ford boss  Richard Parry-Jones stepping down.
He will be replaced next month by Londons colourful transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy.
The 38.5bn plan is being shelved, while the proposed 50bn HS2, artists impression, will continue
It is understood that the London Crossrail project will also remain unscathed from the planned review
None of Network Rails executive directors will receive a bonus for the past year, Mr McLoughlin said. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne  who will keep his job  admitted they had been overly optimistic about meeting targets.
Labour said the Government knew the scale of the crisis before the election but sought to keep a lid on it to avoid damaging headlines.
In the Commons, Labour transport spokesman Michael Dugher told Mr McLoughlin: You spent the election campaign repeating promises you knew you would break. Ministers may try to shift all the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the Governments watch.
MP Clive Betts told Radio 4s PM programme: It has been becoming apparent over the past year that costs were going up and timescales were slipping, yet the Government kept this under wraps until after the election.
John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: This has been covered up for some time. There is a lot of anger that so many people have been misled by all this rubbish about the northern powerhouse. A lot of Tory MPs have been elected under false pretences.
Fly through the 42KM of Crossrail tunnels in this incredible...
Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: There have been clear signs since Christmas that Government is losing patience. And had it not been for a desire to avoid controversial headlines in the run-up to a General Election, the odds are that Network Rail would have been reformed by now in ways it may not have welcomed. There was suppressed Government fury at New Year, following the engineering embarrassments at Kings Cross and Paddington. But pre-election politics ensured a calm face.
Asked whether ministers knew before the election that the scheme was under threat, David Camerons official spokesman did not deny that this was the case. However, a Department of Transport spokesman said: Its not something the Secretary of State has kept hidden.
Tory backbenchers were angry that HS2 was not being cut. Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan said: I have always been worried that major projects such as HS2 would suck the life out of other areas.
If these projects are undeliverable now, what does that mean to the HS2 in a few years time. Will that become undeliverable too?
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: We have been promised time and time again that the money being pumped into HS2 would not affect the delivery of other infrastructure projects, but its clear that it is now cannibalising the rest of the railway budget and other upgrades with far more robust business plans are being shelved.
ALEX BRUMMER: After this shambles HS2 can now be no more than a dream
During the General Election campaign, we heard much from Chancellor George Osborne about building a Northern Powerhouse, and plans for exciting investment in Britains Victorian infrastructure  but little about how it would be delivered.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Greens were mocked for commitments to renationalise all or parts of Britains creaking rail network.
Now, the truth has been revealed. The running of Network Rail  which owns and operates our railways  has been a shambles, electrification of key routes is way behind schedule and is having to be postponed or even cancelled, and the Tory government is being forced to take direct control of the network.
Former Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, pictured, created Network Rail on a not-for-profit basis in 2001 and created an ungainly board including unions, passengers and green groups with weak governance

Passengers were left stranded last Christmas when engineering works overran causing chaos
The largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times was at the heart of the Conservatives long-term plan to secure Britains economic future, to improve productivity and growth. That part of the plan now looks to be in serious trouble, and it is difficult to see how it can easily be rescued at a time when state spending is under pressure.
The real scandal is that the slide into chaos of the Governments promised 38.5billion investment programme must have been known to civil servants and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin before the country went to the polls on May 7, but not a word crossed anyones lips.
Instead, the nation was treated to a naively optimistic view of a nation determined to revitalise rail travel. Plans included electrification of the TransPennine Express running between Manchester, Leeds and York; improvements of the Midland mainline linking London and Sheffield, and most significantly of all, the vanity HS2 project  estimated to cost up to 42.5billion.
As a result of the new announcements by McLoughlin, several of the key projects are being paused and mothballed, and there must be real questions as to whether the highly contentious HS2 should be, or will be, undertaken.
The immediate trigger for the Governments shake-up of Network Rail is the mayhem that has been endured by passengers. This was symbolised by the engineering works at Kings Cross station that overran during the last Christmas break, forcing passengers of the East Coast, Thameslink &amp; Great Northern lines to use inadequate Finsbury Park station in North London, which became dangerously over-crowded.

There have to be real questions over whether the HS2, artists impression, will ever go ahead
The holiday season pandemonium is just a microcosm of what many rail travellers have to suffer every day, with standing room only, unexplained delays and replacement bus services, and fares that rise inexorably despite the big taxpayer subsidies.
At the root of these problems was the then Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers decision in 2001 to place Railtrack into administration and replace it with a not-for-profit new firm Network Rail, run by an ungainly board of members drawn from all sections of society, from the trades unions to passengers and green groups.
The bizarre structure made for weak governance, which saw rail chieftains rewarding themselves like captains of industry but failing miserably to deliver the services the public craved. Labour eventually had to pay compensation to the Railtrack shareholders.
The impossible governance structure allowed the top brass at Network Rail to enjoy riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Chief executive Mark Carne has a base salary of 675,000 and was forced to forgo a bonus of 135,000 for 2014 (a sum almost equal to the Prime Ministers pay of 142,500) after the Christmas chaos. He is just one of a bunch of Network Rail executives whose pay, bonuses and pensions hover around the 1million mark.
This is nothing compared to the pay of some of the operating companies, with David Brown of Go-Ahead group which runs London-Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, earning a shade under 2million.
One of the immediate results of the changes just unveiled is that finally, after years of dissatisfaction with the way in which Network Rail has been governed, the byzantine structure is being abolished forthwith.
Instead, there is to be rule from Whitehall, with the former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown being parachuted in as Special Director of Network Rail and reporting directly to the Transport Secretary. Brown will work alongside the colourful Sir Peter Hendy, the new Network Rail chairman, who is credited with running the London Underground on time during the Olympics.
What is absolutely clear from the changes and the review that has been unveiled is that under the chairmanship of Richard Parry-Jones, who is to step down, Network Rail lost control of the costs of one of the governments most high-profile infrastructure projects.
As chief executive, Mark Carne admits the projects which Network Rails been charged with delivering are going to take longer and cost more than we originally thought.
The Governments promise to spend 38.5 billion on railways over five years does not seem to be at risk. What will be affected is the ambition to create a 21st-century electrified rail system to empower the North of England and improve the links with the capital.
Whatever the outcome of the Governments review  it is promising decisions by the autumn  the imbroglio raises huge questions over the future of the HS2 project, connecting London to Manchester and running through some of Britains most unspoiled landscaped in the Chilterns; and HS3, designed to go East-West across the North of England connecting Manchester to Hull.
If the relatively simple task of modernising and electrifying some of the busiest rail links in the country cannot be achieved  despite a generous infrastructure budget  then the high-speed projects can be no more than a pipedream.
As for long-suffering commuters and business travellers, the pain of rail travel will continue.
Direct control from Whitehall may be an improvement on the old Network Rail, but it cannot be the right long-term solution. Until the private enterprise disciplines of cost controls, efficient engineering and delivery of projects on time are brought to the rail network, the taxpayer will not get value for money.

She told police she never consented to having the image posted on social media and was 'worried' about other people seeing it.

She said: 'This was a nasty offence with the potential to have an emotional impact on the victim.

Kennedy has become one of the first people in Britain to be prosecuted under the new 'revenge porn' laws
At Cardiff Magistrates' Court (pictured) yesterday, Kennedy admitted disclosing private sexual photographs with intent to cause distress. He was fined 405 and given a community order for the 'nasty offence'
'This is a relatively new offence but we want to make sure that you understand that what you did is very serious.'
Siobhan Blake, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'The distress caused by this type of behaviour is considerable.
'We want to make it abundantly clear that those who engage in this type of vindictive activity can expect to find themselves in court.'
'Although this case was brought to court under new legislation introduced within the last year, it should not be a surprise to anyone that online conduct of this nature is a criminal offence.'
MAXIMUM PRISON SENTENCE OF TWO YEARS: NEW REVENGE PORN LAWS
The distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress could result in two years in prison under new laws (file picture)
Those convicted of revenge porn  the distribution of a private sexual image of someone without their consent and with the intention of causing them distress  could face two years in prison under new laws.
'Revenge porn' is now a specific offence, covering the sharing of images both online and offline, in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill - which went through Parliament in April.
It means that images posted to social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are counted under the offence, as well as those that are shared via text message.
Images shared via email, on a website or the distribution of physical copies are also counted.
The offence covers photographs or films which show people engaged in sexual activity or depicted in a sexual way or with their genitals exposed, where what is shown would not usually be seen in public.
Victims of revenge porn have previously found it difficult to have pictures removed from the internet.
Many sites where the images are hosted are based outside the UK, and requests to remove content are often ignored. In some cases, asking for removal results in more attention being brought to the images.
The move to clamp down on 'revenge porn' came after 149 cases, the vast majority of them involving women victims, were reported over two and a half years. Only six led to prosecutions.
However, the new rules do not affect the consensual 'sexting' of images by under-18s. This is already illegal  but police cannot monitor mobile photo messages.
Under the new law, victims and others are able to report offences to the police to investigate and officers will then work with the Crown Prosecution Service to take forward cases for prosecution.
Announcing the new laws earlier this year,Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'The fact that there are individuals who are cruelly distributing intimate pictures of their former partners without their consent is almost beyond belief.
'We want those who fall victim to this type of disgusting behaviour to know that we are on their side and will do everything we can to bring offenders to justice.'
Nicky Morgan, Minister for Women and Equalities, said: 'Circulating intimate photos of an individual without their consent is never acceptable. People are entitled to expect a reasonable level of respect and privacy.
'It is right that those who do circulate these images are held to account, and that we educate young people to the hurt that can be caused by breaking this trust.'

Just four days after Russell Brand was told to F*** off back to Miliband as he prepared to address Left-wing protesters on an anti-austerity march, the self-styled revolutionary has upset Bob Geldofs daughter Fifi.
Fifi, whose sister Peaches died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 25, was a guest at a fundraising event this week for a charity that specialises in treatment for alcohol and drug addiction.
But Fifi was horrified when former addict Brand gave a speech in which he made jokes about drug abuse.

From what Ive experienced, a lot of people here tonight are on drugs right now, Brand told guests, who included recently knighted singer Sir Van Morrison, actress Sadie Frost and Madness frontman Suggs.
It was like an avalanche on the back of my toilet.
Peaches Geldof (pictured) died of a heroin overdose last year at the age of 25
Referring to the charity Focus 12s founder Chip Somers, he told guests at the event at Londons Porchester Hall: Chip said, If you dont stop taking drugs in the next six months youll be dead, in a lunatic asylum or in prison. So I thought: Well, Ive got five months, three weeks and six days before I have to do anything, f*** that.
Fifi  whose mother, TV presenter Paula Yates, died of a heroin overdose aged 41  was disgusted by the comments from the so-called comedian, saying: Less of a Russell Brand fan than ever after his offensive and highly inappropriate speech at the addiction charity event.
The 32-year-old PR executive, who was sporting a new upper-arm tattoo of a peach in honour of her sister, also pointed to a magazine article comparing Brand to the pompous would-be anarchist character Rick, played by the late Rik Mayall, in the Eighties sitcom The Young Ones.
Fifi added of Brand: Silly try- hard ****.
She also called him an 'unfunny b*****d' and an 'uber-douche extraordinaire'.
Last weekend Brand had to be held back in the VIP area of a rally against Government cuts as a group in Parliament Square screamed abuse at him because of his backing for Red Ed Milibands Labour Party at the General Election.
The hecklers called him a turncoat for telling fans to vote Labour while demanding an anti-capitalist revolution in Britain.
End of the affair for Google pair
It was the love affair that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley.
But two years after Google founder Sergey Brin sensationally left his wife for his young British lover, Amanda Rosenberg, the pair have now split.
Amanda Rosenberg (left) was accused of 'sleeping her way to the top' after it was revealed she was involved with Sergey Brin (right)
After moving to the U.S. after graduating from Leeds University, the Marlborough College-educated Rosenberg, 28  she was two years below Pippa Middleton  rose quickly through the ranks at Google: she was later accused online of sleeping her way to the top. She became close to Brin, 41, after working on the Google Glass project.
Their affair came to light when Brins wife of six years, Anne, discovered incriminating emails.
Rosenberg appears to have left Google and, according to her LinkedIn profile, now works for a software design company.
Meanwhile, it emerges Brin and Anne have quietly divorced. Their prenuptial agreement rules out any possibility of a fight over his 20 billion fortune.

Henry keeps me in touch with the latest music, admits Whittingdale, who hopes to attend Glastonbury next year after a diary clash prevented him attending this weekend.
Henry stays out of the political arena, but he did tweet after the May poll: Incredible result and one Im more than happy with, surely FPTP [first past the post] has to go now though . . .
Whittingdale senior, who will headbang to AC/DC at Wembley next weekend, might argue theres a little life left in the current voting system once the Tories secure boundary changes that would make their electoral position even more secure.
Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes has created a showbusiness dynasty. The Oscar-winners success has inspired his son Peregrine, 23, to follow him into the industry. He is now pursuing a career in film production, says Lord Fellowes, 65, who will give a talk at the Chalke Valley History Festival on Sunday about the world of Downton. I am proud of him, yes, and quite surprised  he hasnt had a day out of work since he left university. Thats quite extraordinary in our business.

	A number of sexual encounters and nude scenes in Swedish Akta Manniskor, pictured, don't appear in the British version Humans as the makers don't want it to be sexually exploitative.

        <MainBody>Watch the dark trailer for new Channel 4 drama Humans
Big hit: It's the channel's highest rating show since 1992 but, uncharacteristically, it tones down the sexual content compared to it's Swedish counterpart
Just a kiss: This is another raunchy scene from the Swedish version of the show in which a man and a female robot kiss passionately
The Swedish version features several sexual encounters between humans and machines which will not feature in the remake, while scenes featuring nudity have been toned down.
There is no nudity in the British version, co-writer Sam Vincent told The Mail on Sunday. We do not want to be perceived as being exploitative.
6 million Channel 4 viewers saw lustful human teenager Toby try to touch the breasts of robot synth Anita, played by Gemma Chan
Last week, 6 million Channel 4 viewers saw lustful human teenager Toby try to touch the breasts of robot synth Anita, played by Gemma Chan. But she stopped him, declaring it inappropriate. However, in the Swedish version, Anita allows him to rub her intimately. In another scene from the original, a male cyborg touches his female owners breasts over the breakfast table before the couple are shown making love. This too is absent from the British version. And in another moment cut from the UK remake, the Swedish Anita removes her top and examines her breasts in a mirror.
Vincent added: Because we go deeper into the examination of sexual exploitation in our show we had to be very careful we were not going to be exploitative ourselves. That is why we didnt want to have a lot of nudity.
The new sensitivity marks a change of tone for Channel 4, which once revelled in shocking audiences with risque content, leading its former chief executive Michael Grade to be dubbed Britains pornographer in chief.
But Humans is not entirely chaste. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that an upcoming episode will feature a sexual encounter between a human and a synth.
Producer Chris Fry said: Its beautifully handled and at no point is it gratuitous. We wanted to explore the question of whether doing something like that with a synthetic is the same as doing it with a human being.
Humans, which is Channel 4s biggest ratings drama success since The Camomile Lawn in 1992, continues tonight at 9pm.

Novak's keen fan showed off her immaculately curled hair and designer dress as she stood to receive the T-shirt as he flung it in to the crowd.
And despite her pristine appearance she didn't hesitate to pull it on before grabbing Djokovic's face between two perfectly manicured hands and giving him a smacker.
The lucky spectator looked thrilled  to catch the world number one's t-shirt despite the fact it was soaked in sweat
Thrilled with her accomplishment, the brunette threw her hands up in delight as Djokovic moved away to carry on with the match
The fan is clasps the Serbian's face with her perfectly manicured talons and brings him in for a kiss
Of course, the player is happily married to model Jelena and the duo are enjoying their first year of marriage. 
But no doubt thoughts of being a domestic god are far from his mind in the run-up to the Grand Slam which kicks off on Monday.
The world No 1 has opted not to play in any of the official grass-court tournaments in the lead up to Wimbledon.
And as the favourite to triumph at the All-England club following the conclusion of The Boodles event, as he looks to retain his Wimbledon title and win for the third time in his career.
The 28-year-old has already won the Australian Open this year, but missed out on French Open glory, losing to Stan Wawrinka in four sets in the final.
Meanwhile, Richard Gasquet also gave fans a thrill by handing his sweaty shirt over to a well-dressed blonde sitting courtside.
He was also pulled into an intimate embrace by her.

'If youre able to cut a mans head off, youre sick. But right music evokes emotion. So if theyre listening to Shaggy music or reggae music, theyre not going to want to cut somebodys head off,' he said.
'Therere two thing you want to do when you listen to reggae: You get somebody pregnant, or youre f**king high. High people dont want to kill nothing; they want to love. They need to bag some Jamaican weed and distribute it amongst ISIS. I guarantee there wont be any more wars out there.'
Militants: Shaggy went as far to say that if ISIS recruits were to listen his latest single, the pleasantly-titled 'Go F**k Yourself', they would turn away from terrorism altogether and embrace peace
Mr Lover Lover: Shaggy found fame in the mid-1990s with his hit single Boombastic (pictured)
Shaggy found fame in the mid-1990s with his  blend of reggae, hip hop and pop and a unique voice that inspired thousands of playground imitators.
Veteran: The 46-year-old Jamaican actually served as a US marine in Iraq during the first Gulf War
Though born in Kingston, Jamaica, Shaggy's family moved tothe Flatbush area of Brooklyn in New York aged 18, where he started singing and performing alongside friends.
He put his music career on temporary hold, however, to enlist as a Marine during the first Gulf War, serving with the firing battery from the 10th Marine Regiment in Iraq.
While serving in the army, Shaggy perfected his unique vocal style and wrote the song that would eventually become a hit single around the world, 'Boombastic'.
His first big success was a cover of the Folkes Brothers' 'Oh, Carolina', however, which hit number one in the UK in 1993.
'Boombastic' was the next big success two years later, reaching number one around the world after it was featured on a television advertisement for Levi jeans.
The album of the same name won a Grammy award the following year.
After a few years without a major hit, Shaggy returned alongside Jamaican singer RikRok on the smash hit single 'It Wasn't Me' in 2000, which again was an international number one.
The follow-up 'Angel' also fared well in the charts but Shaggy has struggled with mainstream success since the early 2000s.
Idea: The 90s star suggested that one peaceful solution to the threat posed by ISIS - led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) is that his music could be pumped in ISIS strongholds and training camps

	Zack Davies was found guilty of trying to kill Dr Sarandev Bhambra in front of shoppers at the Tesco supermarket in Mold, North Wales while shouting 'White Power' and 'I did it for Lee Rigby'.

'Dr Bhamdra sustained the most dreadful life-changing injuries during a sustained racist attack on an innocent man, a member of a caring profession here in Mold carrying out work for the benefit of the community, who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'
He also said many in the store and the emergency services had acted with courage that day but he singled out the actions of Mr Fuller for his 'quite astounding courage' and said he was considering how it should be best recognised.
Davies, pictured, was said to have been obsessed with Nazi ideology, with various associated literature found in a later police search of his home
He added: 'If it had not been for Peter Fuller there is every chance that Dr Bhandra would not be with us today, he would have been killed by this man. Mr Fullers courage is truly exceptional.
A knife, which was found by police belonging to Davies.Witnesses reported seeing a white man chasing an Asian man through the store with a knife and hammer
'It was a desperately sad and sorry case and the way Dr Bhandra coped and Mr Fuller behaved are just two rays of hope and light in an otherwise dreadful case.'
The jury heard how Davies would sit in his flat playing violent video games such as Call Of Duty on his XBox, sometimes for six or seven hours a day and watch online videos of ISIS beheadings.
Expelled from Mold Alun High School at 11 for taking a knife to school to attack a classmate, Davies became a loner and admitted carrying a knife with him every day since he was 15 because of his growing paranoia.
He harboured a hatred for his mothers boyfriend who he blamed for having to leave his mothers home and on January 14 he packed a machete, hammer and knife into his rucksack and went to attack Sion Williams, who worked at the towns post office in Earl Road.
When he failed to find him he sat for while before making his way through town where he caught site of Dr Bhambra near the bus station.
Prosecutor Sion ap Mihangel said Davies then followed Dr Bhambra to Tesco where he put down his rucksack, took out the hammer and machete and attacked him from behind with a hammer blow to the head shouting 'white power' and 'remember Lee Rigby'.
Terrified shoppers told how Davies then pursued the bleeding Dr Bhambra who fell several times as he slashed his skull to the bone and gashed his back with the machete and cut the nerves and tendons to his left hand as he tried to defend himself.
The court heard Dr Bhambra, of Leeds, told police: He would have hacked me to bits. I have no doubt in my mind that he was trying to kill me. I was singled out, I was attacked on the basis of my colour  I thought I was going to die.
Davies was described as a racist with a fascination for Far Right ideologies after police found Nazi-linked literature at his home. He also described Jihadi John as an inspiration
During a search of his home, police found various right wing literature and Davies was also said to be fascinated by ISIS
His ordeal ended when ex-soldier Mr Fuller bravely stepped into the path of Davies and told him he was ex-forces and to stop, because he was not solving anything.
He said 'we are under attack' but Mr Fuller said what he was doing was madness and Dr Bhandra was not guilty of anything.
As he was handcuffed and taken away by police, Davies told the gathered crowd that he had done it for murdered guardsman Lee Rigby.
Mr ap Mihangel described Davies as a racist with a fascination for Far Right ideologies and read everything from Koran passages, stickers for neo-Nazi group Combat 18to Hitlers Mein Kampf. In interview he had told police that may be the 'wrong' side had won the Second World War.
The attack happened at a Tesco store in North Wales, where Dr Bhambra had been shopping on his lunch break
He even said he had considered at one point converting to Islam because he was tired of his new flatmates and their drug-taking.
Davies, who Mr ap Mihangel said was intelligent and 'well read in his field', added he was interested in both extreme left and right wing ideologies and had been fascinated by ISIS and its 'no compromise' philosophy.
BRAVERY OF EX-SOLDIER WHO STOPPED ATTACK
The astounding courage of ex-soldier Peter Fuller almost certainly saved Dr Bhambras life, a judge said.
Mr Fuller told the court that he initially watched in shock as Davies rained multiple blows on the victim.
But as the dentist fled, Mr Fuller stood in Daviess way and shouted: Stop, this is madness. I am ex-forces.
He said Davies told him we are under attack. But the fact I said I was an ex-soldier, that I stood in his way, took the wind out of his sails, Mr Fuller added.
He persuaded the attacker to place his weapons on the floor and kept him talking until police arrived.
Judge Rowlands said: If it had not been for Peter Fuller there is every chance that Dr Bhambra would not be with us  Mr Fullers courage is truly exceptional.
The family of the victim said that they would be forever grateful to the ex-soldier.
He had taken a mask to wear during an attack on his mothers boyfriend and was planning to shout 'God Is Great' is Arabic while he did it.
He admitted he had selected Dr Bhambra solely because of the colour of his skin and Asian appearance.
In court Davies apologised to the family of Lee Rigby for dragging his name into the case and also to Dr Bhambra who he agreed was simply an innocent victim.
Just before he had left his flat, Mr ap Mihangel said Davies had looked at a website on the Koran and beheadings. But a search of his computer history also found extreme violent websites such as Best Gore and All the Gore.
Dr Bhambras brother, Dr Tarlochan Singh Bhambra made a statement outside Mold Crown Court following the guilty verdict against Davies.
He said: 'Sarandev was singled out because of the colour of his skin. We are in no doubt that had the racial disposition of this case been reversed this would be reported as an act of terror with a wider media coverage.
'We as a family have listened intently to the evidence and are in no doubt given the racial and political motivation that this should be rightly defined as an act of terrorism.
'By his own admission Zack Davies had extreme neo nazi views and is a member of a white supremacist organisation.
'Ethnic minorities have and continue to contribute positively to the multicultural Britain of 2015. Sikhs have sacrificed their lives in both world wars to facilitate the freedom that Britain enjoys today.'
After the verdict today, Dr Bhambra's brother Dr Tarlochan Bhambra made a statement on behalf of the family outside Mold Crown Court
Gareth Preston, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, added: 'Zackery Davies is a dangerous young man whose distorted and racist views led him to commit a terrifying act of violence.
'This was an attack against a complete stranger, singled out for no other reason than his ethnicity.
'Such was the level of violence involved that were it not for the extremely courageous actions of ex-serviceman Peter Fuller, this offence could have become an act of murder.
'As it is, Davies's actions have left Dr Bhambra with life-changing injuries. We hope that today's conviction will be of some comfort to him as he seeks to move forward with his life.'
One of his flatmates, who asked not to be named, told the Daily Mail Davies believed Muslims should go back where they came from.

	Inhibiting a protein called B2M, which is involved in immunity, reversed the decline in thinking and memory associated with ageing, scientists from the University of California, San Francisco, found.

Older mice who received young blood in the first study could find the hidden platforms easier - though it was not clear why or how.
Ageing is associated with a progressive decline in cognitive function, the ability to think, understand, remember and learn, as well as slower regeneration of message-relaying neurons in the brain.
'Ageing remains the most dominant risk factor for dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease,' the authors of the study wrote in the paper.
As such, it is imperative to gain insight on the mechanisms that drive ageing in the brain, in order to understand what makes a person vulnerability to a declines in cognitive ability, they added.
From their latest work, it appears that B2M, a protein involved in immunity, may be associated with the ageing of the brain.
Scientists have found a protein called B2M which is found in higher levels of the blood of older people, impairs learning and memory, ageing the brain
B2M injections impaired the learning ability, memory, and neuron growth of lab mice, the team wrote.
But the effect was 'reversible' by stopping the injections.
In another experiment, the scientists eliminated B2M genetically in mice, and 'observed that the old mice lacking B2M did not develop memory loss', said Dr Villeda.
This all implied the molecule 'could be targeted to potentially restore cognitive ability in the elderly', he added.
The next step would be to develop a molecule that can either block the protein, or help remove it from old human blood.
B2M has previously also been found in elevated levels in the cerebral spinal fluid of dementia patients.
The research was published in the journal Nature Medicine.
KEY CHANGES IN THE BRAIN IN MIDDLE AGE MAY INDICATE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, SCIENTISTS DISCOVER
Scientists have discovered the key markers in the brain and spinal fluid in middle age that indicate if a person is likely to develop Alzheimer's disease.
This could allow doctors to identify those who will develop dementia years later, they said.
'It's too early to use these biomarkers to definitively predict whether individual patients will develop Alzheimer's disease, but we're working toward that goal,' said senior author Professor Anne Fagan, of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
'One day, we hope to use such measures to identify and treat people years before memory loss and other cognitive problems become apparent.'
Scientists discovered key changes in the brain in middle age that can indicate Alzheimer's disease. Pictured is the brain of a person with Alzheimer's under the microscope
The study gathered data over 10 years and involved 169 cognitively normal research participants ages 45 to 75 when they entered the study.
Each participant received a complete clinical, cognitive imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis every three years, with a minimum of two evaluations.
The biomarkers they analysied included the amount of amyloid beta 42 present in the brain.
Amyloid beta 42 a protein that is the principal ingredient of Alzheimer's plaques.
Another is tau, a structural part of brain cells that increases in the cerebrospinal fluid as Alzheimer's disease damages brain cells.
They also looked at YKL-40, a protein produced by the brain cells that indicates inflammation.
Brain scans were also carried out to reveal the presence of amyloid plaques in the brain.
At the participants' initial assessments, researchers divided them into three age groups: early-middle age (45-54); mid-middle age (55- 64); and late-middle age (65-74).
The changes in the brain were more pronounced in people with a specific gene known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's, researchers found. Pictured are brain scans of a person with Alzheimer's disease
The scientists found that drops in amyloid beta 42 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid among the people in the study ages 45-54, who had normal thinking abilities at this point, are linked to the appearance of plaques in brain scans years later.
The researchers also found that tau and other markers of damage to brain cells increase sharply in some individuals as they reach their mid-50s to mid-70s.
YKL-40 rises throughout the age groups focused on in the study, researchers found.
Previous research has shown that all of these markers may be affected by Alzheimer's disease, but this is the first large data set to show that they change over time in middle-aged individuals.
All of these changes were more pronounced in participants who carried a form of a gene that significantly increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
The gene is known as APOE, and scientists have known that people with two copies of a particular version of this gene have up to 10 times the risk of developing Alzheimer's as those with other versions of the gene.
The study was published in the journal JAMA Neurology.

EXCLUSIVE: Are these bits of metal proof that Amelia Earhart died after being captured by the Japanese on remote Pacific atoll  and the U.S. government KNEW but covered it up?
Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan have not been heard of since July 1937 when they took off from New Guinea on 30th leg of round the world flight
But two investigators hope the mystery could be at an end within weeks
They believe they have two vital bits of evidence proving they landed in the Marshall Islands that day
If correct, it could prove they died while in the hands of the Japanese military - and that the U.S. government decided hero pilot was 'expendable'

She added: 'They want a true perspective of whats going on in the world.'
While a gilded life may lay ahead of the children in question, many of whom are attending England's most elite independent schools, work experience offers the offspring of 'ultra high net worth individuals' - those in possession of at least a 20million wealth - the chance to walk in more ordinary shoes.

World's richest postcode: London has the highest proportion of billionaires with 140 now owning a home in the city(Pictured is 1 Cornwall Terrace, which sold for 80m in 2013)
Villani said that the biggest request for work placements was in areas of 'medicine and dentistry, law, banking, geo-political business research, finance, politics, photography, art, film and charitable work.'
Last month, luxury property agent Beauchamp Estates released its Ultra Prime Barometer, a study on billionaires and their property habits.
London has the highest concentration of billionaires in the world - with around 140 now owning a home in the city - far more than New York, which has 103, Moscow, which has 85, Hong Kong, which has 82 and Paris's 33.
While a London post-code is currently a must-have for the world's billionaires, there's also a growing trend towards placing them in more diverse educational facilities, in a bid to introduce children to people from different backgrounds.
Mrs Villiani said that England was appealing to the super-rich because living here often offered more freedom to their children than their own country of birth might.
The Salamanca Group also has a school placement service, which costs around 10,000 and offers to help parents find the right school for their children, as well as helping them source uniforms and practice interview techniques.

Germany's central bank yesterday criticised the way Greek lenders are being propped up by emergency funds from Europe, in a sign that patience with Athens is wearing thin.
Greek banks have become increasingly dependent on a lifeline from the European Central Bank for survival as savers withdraw billions of euros from accounts.
But Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank and an influential figure at the ECB, said this emergency help may breach EU law.

Last week scores took to social media to complain the Corporation had lowered the tone of the highlights programme with its informal style and introduction of a studio audience.
In one episode Ms Balding was seen hitting a ball back and forth with Tim Henman using children's rackets. 
Among complaints were criticisms the sports presenter, who was largely praised for her coverage of the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, did not know enough about tennis.
She was drafted in by the BBC following the departure of John Inverdale last year who stepped down from the show amid a row over alleged sexism.

Praise: Viewers were happy with the change in format on Monday though some still complained about Ms Balding's coverage
Criticised: Presenter Clare Balding was slammed for her coverage of the tournament with many claiming the presenter does not know enough about tennis for the role
Playful: Ms Balding and former player Tim Henman were filmed in one episode hitting a ball with children's tennis rackets
Tim Henman and Clare Balding warm up before Wimbledon Day 3
Last week the programme was filmed in The Gatsby Club, an expensive hospitality area within the grounds.
While the BBC said no additional cost had been incurred by moving the programme on Monday, it would not disclose how much had already been spent on filming in The Gatsby Club last week.
While viewers were grateful to see the programme rid of its playful studio audience, some were still left unimpressed by Ms Balding's coverage.
'Bring back John Inverdale. Clare Balding looks like a rabbit caught in headlights,' said one Twitter user while another fumed: 'Wimbledon 2day so much better tonight but what's glaringly obvious is how little Clare Balding actually knows about tennis.'
Asked why it had taken the decision to change the format halfway through, the BBC said the show had always been intended to 'evolve'.
'We said from the outset that Wimbledon 2Day would evolve throughout the Championship,' a spokesman told MailOnline.
'Of course we listen to audience feedback and that helps to shape the changes we make.
'We have moved to a new location, on top of the centre court building, which gives an excellent backdrop of the heart of Wimbledon, as the Championship builds to its climax.'

Malaysian Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan (pictured greeting supporters at a by-election in 2010) reprimanded the teacher, but insisted that the remark was a joke
Two men have been arrested over the attack.
Malaysian Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan reprimanded the teacher, but insisted that the remark was a joke.
Deputy education minister, Mary Yap, a non-Muslim, has previously urged non-Muslim students to avoid eating and drinking in front of Muslim schoolmates during Ramadan, it was reported by PRI .
The education authority faced a backlash during Ramadan last year when a parent posted pictures online of her daughter and other non-Muslims being forced to eat in a shower room because thecanteen wasclosed.
Many canteens in Malaysian public institutions, including some public schools and universities, are shut during Ramadan despite there being large numbers of non-Muslim pupils.

'I asked doctors for a boob job five years ago and they referred me to a plastic surgeon.
'But he refused to do the operation on the NHS. I was devastated because I had got my hopes up.
'Having 12 children has not helped my boobs. But I have always had a small chest and it affects my self-confidence.
'I am not doing it for Robert. I am doing it for myself.
'I cannot wear certain clothes as they make my chest look flat. I want the op as soon as I have saved up enough money.'
The Prudhams moved from Gravesend, Kent to Skelmersdale, Lancashire after claiming they had been victims of a 'vicious hate campaign.'
Mrs Prudham claims she received verbal abuse after boasting that she takes her family on foreign holidays and openly splashing out on designer handbags
She claims she received verbal abuse after boasting that she takes her family on foreign holidays and openly splashing out on designer handbags.
The family now live in a five-bedroom house with a 1,000-a-month rent bill. The couple's annual income is believed to be more than 72,000.
Until now, the Prudhams have claimed 39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham's monthly salary of 1,600 as a delivery driver.
Mrs Prudham admits she is 'addicted' to having babies and had her first child George, now 15, when she was just 17.
She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 14, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, ten.
Mrs Prudham, who is making plans for a 13th child, said she enjoys being pregnant as her breasts get bigger, but then she feels depressed when her chest shrinks back
She then had three unplanned pregnancies; Maisie, nine, Lillie, seven, and Madison, six.
In March 2009, she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now five. They then had Lenny, now three, before she gave birth to daughter Lainey in January last year.
She gave birth to twins Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose last autumn before having her 12th child last month.
Mrs Prudham, who believes she will have saved enough from benefits to have the breast enlargement next year, added that she is busy settling Tillie-Grace into their new home.
She said : 'It is complete chaos with endless loads of washing, ironing and nappies.
'But being so busy means I ping back to a size 10 and I never have stretch marks.
'The only thing I hate is my small boobs. But I will rectify that soon.'

ASYLUM!
Only this week 140 members of the Taliban family from Afghanistan were flown Goat Class from Kabul to our international gateway at Stansted. They join tens of thousands of other lucky winners already in Britain.
Our most popular destinations include the world-famous Toddington Services Area in historic Bedfordshire . . .

Hundreds of lawyers, social workers and counsellors are waiting to help. It wont cost you a penny. So play today. It could change your life for ever.
Iraqi terrorists, Afghan dissidents, Albanian gangsters, Kosovan drug-smugglers, Tamil Tigers, bogus Bosnians, Rwandan mass murderers, Somali guerillas.
COME ON DOWN!
Get along to the airport. Get along to the lorry park. Get along to the ferry terminal. Dont stop in Germany or France. Go straight to Britain.
You are guaranteed to be one of tens of thousands of lucky winners in the softest game on Earth. Roll up, roll up my friends, for the game that never ends. Everyones a winner, when they play:
ASYLUM!
We keep being told that the current refugee crisis is a direct result of our involvement in the American-led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq and Britains meddling in foreign civil wars, such as the bombing of Libya.
But I wrote Asylum! in February 2000, a full 18 months before 9/11. In the U.S., George W. Bush wasnt even the official Republican candidate, let alone President. The Afghan and Iraq wars werent so much as a twinkle on the Pentagons radar. Back then, Tony Blair was too busy bombing the Balkans.
The Sangatte departure lounge opened as long ago as 1999, to accommodate immigrants trying to enter Britain illegally. There were riots at the camp in 2001 and 2002, before it was closed.
So please dont try to kid us that the mayhem at Calais is a new phenomenon. This all dates back to what Peter Mandelson called Labours deliberate decision to scour the world for migrants, so they could rub the Rights noses in diversity.
Once the Blair government made it plain that everyone was welcome, however they entered this country  and thanks to the newly-adopted Yuman Rites Act would never be sent home  its hardly surprising the world beat a path to our door.
Who can forget the sight of the then Home Secretary, Jolly Jack Straw, scuttling down to Dover to welcome in person a lorry load of immigrants from Sangatte, like an obsequious package holiday rep? He should have worn a red coat and a pair of white strides.
This madness was compounded by our membership of the EU, which meant that anyone who managed to set foot in Europe could make straight for the French coast bound for England.
Our island location and our opt-out from the Schengen open-borders treaty was never going to protect us. When our politicians were so keen to expand the EU to embrace former Communist countries in Eastern Europe, did they envisage that, say, Hungary, would become the first port of call for London-bound immigrants from Africa and the Middle East?
Of course they didnt. No one ever thinks anything through. Plenty of British politicians, including Winston Churchill wannabe Boris Johnson, are lobbying for Turkey to be admitted to the EU.
That would be Turkey, gateway to Islamic State. And, as we all know, gates swing both ways.
Already, known Islamist terrorists, hell-bent on attacking infidel targets in Europe, are stowing away among the migrants being picked up in the Mediterranean and deposited in Italy.
If Turkey gets full EU membership, the terrorists wont need to resort to subterfuge. Once theyve slipped over the porous Turkish/Syrian border, theyll be free to head for London.
Even after some Isis-sponsored nut-job has blown himself to Kingdom Come on the Underground, taking goodness knows how many innocents with him, the usual conga-line of hand-wringing Guardianistas will still be insisting that we have a humanitarian duty to take in all-comers, regardless of the consequences.
Sorry, but weve got enough home-grown head-cases ready to commit mass murder in the name of the religion of peace, without importing them from hell-holes in North Africa and beyond. And we know next to nothing about the people heading our way.
I dont dispute that some of these migrants are fleeing poverty and pretty grim living conditions at home. But that doesnt necessarily make them refugees. Most are economic migrants.
Earlier, I almost wrote about the world and his wife beating a path to our door. But his wife is conspicuous by her absence. So is his mother, his sister, his daughter.
At least 90 per cent of these 'asylum seekers' are young, able-bodied men in their late teens or early 20s
Dramatic moment migrant climbs into lorry cabin
At least 90 per cent of these asylum seekers are young, able-bodied men in their late teens/early 20s, wearing the latest designer sportswear. If they were genuinely in fear of their lives and fleeing real persecution, wouldnt they have brought their female relatives with them?
But no, its women and children last when it comes to crossing the Med. Were not talking the dance band on the Titanic here.
Of course, its racist to point any of this out. Which is why broadcasters and Left-wing journalists seize on any unfortunate woman with a child they manage to find among the overwhelmingly male multitude.
European leaders met yesterday to agree a common response to the crisis. Fat hope of that. Frances idea of a solution is shovelling all the migrants massed at Calais across the Channel.
And forget about international law, which demands that refugees apply for asylum in the first safe country they arrive in. Europes open borders have made a nonsense of that requirement.
Typically, Britains response has been pathetic. Fining lorry drivers and sending a few more sniffer dogs isnt going to work.
Britain's response of sending a few sniffer dogs and fining lorry drivers has been quite pathetic
But what else should we expect? The Tories promised to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands, knowing full well that wasnt possible while we remain in the EU. Inevitably, immigration has gone not so much through the roof as through the ozone layer over the past few years.
Call Me Daves vainglorious interference in the Arab Spring didnt help. Remember him bombing Libya, without worrying what might come next, and doing a ridiculous lap of honour round Tahrir Square in Egypt? I told you at the time it would end in tears. The fall-out has landed on our doorstep.
Thats why immigration may well prove to be the trump card in the forthcoming EU referendum.
The only proper course of action to halt the invasion of Southern Europe  and by extension Britain  would be to close the EUs borders, which have as many holes as a string vest, and stage a full-scale Nato blockade of the North African coast to prevent any more boats leaving.
But that aint gonna happen, either. All weve done is send HMS Bulwark to act as a free cross-Med ferry. If thats the plan, why not get Bulwark  and that useless new aircraft-free aircraft carrier commissioned by Gordon Brown (HMS Prudence?)  to pick up migrants in Tripoli, bring them straight to Southampton and charge them for the privilege?
David Cameron lays out border control plans at PMQs
Toddington is one of the most popular drop-off points for migrants recently arrived from the continent
Theyre desperate enough to hand over a small fortune to people smugglers. So why dont we cut out the middle man? Theyre going to end up here anyway and the money might help offset the savage cuts in the defence budget.
Looking back on my Asylum! spoof, I notice that I mentioned the world-famous Toddington Service Area, in Bedfordshire.
Toddington is still one of the most popular drop-off points today. A local farmer this week revealed that he spends as much time rounding up illegal immigrants as tending his turnips.
You couldnt make it up.
Fifteen years ago, Asylum! was the worlds fastest-growing game show. Fifteen years from now itll be the longest-running. And those Afghan hijackers are still here, just as I predicted.
Roll up, roll up my friends, for the game that never ends . . .
COME ON DOWN!

This is the skin-crawling moment a deadly python was spotted slithering along a 20ft high telephone line as worried neighbours watched on from below.
The Burmese python - one of the five largest snakes in the world and capable of constricting an adult to death -was seen making its bid for freedom above a quiet residential street.
Police say the snake escaped its tank and managed to climb out of an upstairs window  before precariously making its way along the telephone wire in Anglesey, North Wales.

It was caught on camera by Sergeant Rob Taylor,from North Wales Polices rural crime unit, who said the Asian python managed to make it across the wire to the opposite house and was halfway down the drainpipe before it was captured.
The pictures were taken in a village on the island in July last year, but were tweeted  as a reminder for owners to keep tanks secure as the weather heats up.

	The BBC's current charter will expire next year and negotiations for a new one put almost all aspects of the corporation up for debate according to green paper due to be published next week.

While negotiations for the new charter have not yet formally begun, a source close to the Governments plans told the newspaper that the abolition of the Trust in favour of Ofcom was more than likely, saying: You can put your mortgage on it.
The job of regulating the Corporation includes overseeing its editorial standards, reviewing value for money and monitoring its market impact.
The plans are thought to have the support of Chancellor George Osborne who has previously praised Ofcom for its work regulating commercial broadcasters.
Long battle ahead: Rona Fairhead will have a hard job fighting the plans which are believed to be backed by Chancellor George Osborne who previously praised Ofcom for its work regulating commercial broadcasters
The Green Paper will provide the starting point for discussions rather than concrete plans but it has been reported than a licence fee freeze is the best financial deal the BBC can hope for in the new charter. The idea has also been floated of reducing the length of each charter from ten years to five to allow the BBCs governing system to be more flexible and better able to cope with the shifting nature of the modern media landscape.
OSBORNE 'TO MAKE BBC PAY FOR FREE TV LICENCE FOR OVER-75S'
Chancellor George Osborne is considering making the BBC pay the 600m-a-year cost of free television licences for the over-75s, The Independent reports.
The newspaper claims that making the licence-fee payer rather than the taxpayer foot the bilkl for free tv for the elderly may be part of the Chancellor's new Budget.
Osborne is under pressure to make further cuts when he delivers the budget on July 8th, in order to fulfill the Tory election promise to cut the welfare budget by 12bn per year.
There are also alleged plans to scrap the law around the TV licence fee, which would stop it being a criminal offence not to pay it.
The BBC currently makes 200million-a-year by taking non-payers to court.
The BBC Trust had endured a rocky history since is was established less than a decade ago. It has come under fire for its role in excessive pay-offs to departing executives and the investigation into the Jimmy Savile scandal.
Its trustees have also been criticised for holding other senior jobs at the same time.
Mrs Fairhead faced calls to resign because of her role at HSBC after allegations of tax evasion at the bank came to light. Equally, the Trusts vice chairman Roger Carr faced pressure to leave because he was also chairman of arms firm BAE Systems.
A spokesman for the BBC Trust said last night: We fully expect regulation to be one of the issues debated as part of Charter Review.
The Trust is on the record as saying that the frontrunner would be to transfer the Trusts responsibilities for regulation and accountability to an external (bespoke) regulator.
It was revealed earlier this month that the BBC spends less than half of its money on programmes for licence fee payers.
Only 2.4billion of its 5.1billion annual budget went on public service content in the year to April 2014.
A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: All aspects of the BBC are up for debate as part of the Charter Review.

A field trial of the test, developed by the US company Corgenix, took place at two treatment centres run by the Ministry of Health and Sanitation in Sierra Leone.
A total of 106 patients suspected of having Ebola were given the fingerprick test and also had their blood analysed the normal way.
Every case of Ebola confirmed in the laboratory using the standard procedure was detected by the bedside test, with very few non-infected people wrongly testing positive.
However both tests failed to pick up a small number of Ebola cases that were identified by an alternative ultra-sensitive lab test which is not widely available.
The device works similarly to a home pregnancy test, with the sample applied to a treated strip. If the sample is positive for Ebola, a coloured line appears on the strip at a specific location
Dr Nira Pollock, from Boston Children's Hospital in the US, who led a trial of the test reported in The Lancet medical journal, said: 'Simplifying the process and speeding up diagnosis could have a major impact.'
The device was the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test developed by Corgenix.
The Public Health England lab at Port Loko in Sierra Leone, where clinical samples were routinely sent for standard molecular diagnostic testing, confirmed diagnosis.
Ebola epidemic 'lead to surge in malaria deaths'
Malaria likely killed many more people than usual in the West African nation of Guinea during last year's Ebola outbreak, a new study suggests.
This is because tens of thousands of people with potential signs of the mosquito-spread disease probably shunned health clinics.
The early symptoms of malaria - a fever and body aches - are similar to Ebola.
Health workers said many people with malaria were afraid of catching Ebola at a medical facility or being mistakenly sent to an Ebola clinic.
Experts based their conclusions in part on data such as how many people with malaria symptoms were seen at health clinics in four regions hardest hit by Ebola - and how many malaria medicines were given out.
They compared that to regions without Ebola and concluded there were about 74,000 probable malaria cases that went untreated.
Malaria is the leading killer of children in Guinea.
Malaria likely killed many more people than usual in the West African nation of Guinea during last year's Ebola outbreak, a new study suggests. Health workers said many people with malaria were afraid of catching Ebola at a medical facility or being mistakenly sent to an Ebola clinic
Since the Ebola outbreak was first identified in the forests of Guinea in March 2014, officials estimate the virus has killed more than 2,400 people in the country.
In 2013, about 15,000 people in Guinea were killed by malaria, according to Nets for Life Africa, a U.S. charity.
Mateusz Plucinski of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who led the study, said it was difficult to say how many people among the 74,000 suspected cases might have died of malaria.
But he added it was probably 'substantially higher' than the number of Ebola deaths.
The research was paid for by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.S. President's Malaria Initiative. It was published online Tuesday in the journal, Lancet Infectious Diseases.
In an email, Franco Pagnoni, of the World Health Organisation, said it was possible Ebola could have also caused spikes in malaria cases in the other countries heavily affected by Ebola - and this, in turn could have undermined previous efforts to curb malaria.
Health officials also worry the stress of the Ebola outbreak on Guinea's weak health system also resulted in a drop in vaccination coverage, putting the country at risk of a resurgence of diseases such as measles and polio.

Miss Washington was on a first date with new boyfriend when their carriage - carrying 16 people - ploughed into the one in front.
Last month Miss Washington's brother, Luke, described how machines were 'keeping her going' while she was in intensive care.
Luke Washington said she was 'heavily sedated' when he visited her in hospital shortly after the crash.

He told the BBC: 'She was in intensive care so she had machines keeping her going. It was only the day after they took her off that and she was back to breathing on her own.
'She had a rapid recovery. Each day has gone by and she has improved and improved.'
Speaking about his sister's condition at the time, Mr Washington said: 'Compared to last week when I got to hospital and saw her for the first time, it's a world of difference.
'It's amazing to see her. It was yesterday I walked into the room for the first time that day and she was stood up. To see her from the condition she was in to now being stood up is great.'
He added: 'We've all been there for Leah but she's the one who's kept us going. She's just done amazing.
'I don't know where she's got this strength from but it's really opened our eyes.'

The US PGA Tour stripped golf blogger Stephanie Wei of her media credentials in May after she streamed live video of Masters tournament winner Jordan Spieth during a practice round at the World Golf Championship Match Play event.
STRAWBERRY RIPE FOR HEN-MAN!
Strawberries are a quintessential ingredient of Wimbledon  but this particular one might just fall fowl of the usual standards
The berry is shaped like a chicken, appearing to have a head, tail and even a nest when turned upside down. But Reuben and April Welch, who found the fruit at their farm in Bonnyrigg, Edinburgh, added a beak to complete the effect.
Surely its a dessert fit for former British tennis ace Tim Henman?
Alex Willis, head of digital and content at the All England Club, said tournament organisers would be using live video streaming in a very targeted way, to capture unique moments and give a unique insight into Wimbledon.
The club, in south-west London, has also banned selfie sticks  the metal rods that allow camera phones to be extended up to 3ft for group shots and panoramic images. They are listed under the prohibited items list on the Wimbledon website.
William Hanson, author of The Bluffers Guide To Etiquette, told the Daily Telegraph : Selfie sticks are ridiculous and are probably more a health and safety issue rather than a good taste issue, although you could argue the latter as well.
With any event of the social season there are certain rules and it puts some peoples backs up but if you dont like the rules then dont go to the event.
Meanwhile, Twitter has made a bespoke strawberry emoji  a tiny picture used to illustrate social messaging  for Wimbledon in tribute to the traditional strawberries and cream on sale.
Former tennis star Greg Rusedski has attacked the BBC over its decision to sideline John Inverdale during this years Wimbledon coverage. The 41-year-old branded it a mistake for the corporation to axe Inverdale, 57, from his 14-year run fronting the nightly round-up of the tournaments action.

'It's the first time I've ever been on holiday and feared for my life,' he said.
As one of the first planes landed at Gatwick, Peter Long, joint chief executive of Tui Group, which runs Thomson and First Choice, said that he was 'deeply, deeply shocked' by the atrocity.
He added: 'Our whole organisation is reeling with pain to see the suffering that has taken place in Tunisia.
'The tragedy of the situation continues as we see families who have lost loved ones. Our heartfelt feelings go out towards them.'
British holidaymakers are making their way home from Tunisia
Embrace: Tourists console each other following a shooting attack which left at least 38 tourists dead
Heading home: Return: Today thousands of British people were repatriated, with airlines offering them free flights home after a terrifying ordeal in Tunisia

Protection: As armed guards keep an eye on the leaving buses, Tunisia's Prime Minister announced a series of new security measures including closing renegade mosques
Bereavement counsellors and trauma teams have been sent to Sousse to assist relatives of the dead and injured, the company said.
Yesterday Thomson and First Choice predicted they still had around 5,400 customers in the country.
Flights were landing throughout the day at Manchester, Gatwick, East Midlands, Leeds-Bradford and Doncaster airports.
But some holidaymakers almost missed the evacuation, unaware of the airlift until they saw other guests with suitcases in the hotel lobby.
Mr Long said: 'We had situations where people locked themselves in their rooms because they were so scared, which is understandable.'
A number of tourists were so worried about the possibility of another attack that they asked Tunisian police to accompany them to the airport.
A team of holiday reps was on hand to greet passengers as they entered the arrivals hall at Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 yesterday on the first flights from Enfidha, about 35 miles from Sousse.
Some were clearly distressed as they were led away by staff, with one middle-aged woman in tears.

Two ambulances waited outside the airport and a chaplain was on hand to comfort the returning families. Thomson and First Choice said all trips to Tunisia for the next week would be cancelled.
Another large tour company, Thomas Cook, said it was offering customers due to travel to Tunisia before July 5 the opportunity to cancel or change their holiday free of charge.
It sent two extra flights to the country yesterday, adding: 'We are committed to doing everything we can to support our customers who want to depart.'
Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, which has cancelled all flights and holidays to the region until July 5, added: 'Our absolute priority is to ensure the safe passage home of those customers wishing to travel as soon as possible.
'Aircraft are arriving now in Tunisia and will depart this evening.Passengers can rest assured that, as required, we will provide onward transport from Leeds Bradford and Manchester Airports.'
ABTA said there were an estimated 20,000 British package holidaymakers currently in Tunisia, plus an unknown number of independent travellers.
A spokesman said: 'The first priority is the welfare of holidaymakers in the hotels affected by this terrible incident, and extra flights have been put on to help people return home.'
Contemplative: Tourists sit at the terrace of the Imperiale Marhaba hotel after a gunman opened fire at the beachside hotel in Sousse

It said holidaymakers elsewhere in Tunisia should contact their tour operator and follow any instructions issued by local authorities.
Meanwhile easyJet said it would provide an additional flight from Monastir, Tunisia, for customers wishing to fly home early.
Nearly 430,000 Britons visited Tunisia last year, according to ABTA.
The country's tourism chief, Hamda Abdelaoui, said the massacre was a 'catastrophe' for the industry and would lead to at least 1,000 Tunisians losing their jobs.
Last night it emerged that four UK emergency flights had taken off from Tunisia without any passengers on board, indicating that some visitors had decided to stay on after the attack.

	Aides have warned that the Queen may have to move out of her London home so builders can carry out £150 million worth of refurbishment.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
This week aides warned the Queen may have to move out of her London home so builders can carry out 150 million worth of refurbishment. It was said the Palace, which has not been redecorated for more than 60 years, has fallen into such a state of disrepair that the wiring and plumbing will have to be replaced and the works could take up to ten years.
Against the reported 3.5 billion refurbishment estimate for the House of Commons and Palace of Westminster, the cost looks almost modest. Even so it has soared from a quote only two years ago, when officials predicted 50 million was needed to cover the maintenance for all the royal palaces.
At a time when many are still suffering the hardship of years of economic restraint it may not have been the best moment to ask for more taxpayers money. Certainly, the Queen was not amused that her state visit to Germany has been overshadowed by squabbling between her bean counters and the Scottish government over future funding for the monarchy north of the border.
She was particularly dismayed that Sir Alan Reid, her treasurer and keeper of the privy purse, of whom she is especially fond, found himself in the firing line over the matter.
Maintaining Buckingham Palace has always been a political hot potato. Only two years ago, MPs accused Sir Alan of shocking complacency over repairs to royal buildings when he appeared before a Commons committee. This was why Reid set out the 150 million refurbishment plan this week.
So is the Palace falling down? And if so, can the Queen possibly live there while refurbishment is taking place? There is no doubt work needs to be done. Staff have had to catch rainwater in buckets to protect works of art in the Queens Gallery and the Picture Gallery.
A chunk of masonry the size of a shoebox fell perilously close to Princess Annes car some years ago, forcing emergency repairs to re-face the interior of the quadrangle.
Work has been carried out to the clock face and pediment. Now, I am told, the balcony adjoining the Green Drawing Room, is structurally unsound and out of bounds.
Over the past year, the Palace has had to spend 300,000 on the removal of asbestos in the basement floor ducts, 700,000 on the resurfacing of roadways and paths in the garden, 800,000 on the renewal of slate and lead coverings and 300,000 on the refurbishment of the State Glass Pantry.
Five chandeliers in the Ball Supper Room have been taken down and cleaned by hand, a task that took an incredible two months. On a fact-finding visit, MPs reported cracked plasterwork and discoloured gilding on the staircase. The paintwork in the Blue Room was so faded it was more like a smoky grey room.
In a months time, the Queen will put the bickering behind her when she leaves the Palace for Scotland, where she will spend the summer and early autumn first at Craigowan Lodge and then Balmoral Castle.
After her departure the gates of the palace will be opened to the public at 35.50 a head. For two months visitors will tour the gilded state rooms where investitures, audiences and receptions are held.
A highlight will be the dining table in the ballroom, which will be set for 170 guests, with 2,000 pieces of cutlery, silver-gilt candelabra and tableware, and the Grand Service on which food is presented.
Dresses and jewellery worn by the Queen at state banquets over the years and gifts presented by some of the 110 visiting heads of state she has welcomed to the Palace will be on display. Visitors will also have a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the 12 months of preparation that goes into each state visit to Britain, including the selection of food and wine and Her Majestys outfits.
Ever since the doors were first opened to paying guests in 1993  in response to public outrage that the taxpayer alone should meet the cost of the devastating Windsor Castle fire  it has been one of Londons most popular attractions.
The Queen has been told that she may have to move out of Buckingham Palace for ten years
Members of the public can get the chance to tour Buckingham Palace while the queen is away for the summer
The public opening is also one of the reasons why the repairs have stacked up. In the old days before the Palace was opened for the summer, an annual maintenance programme was carried out, says a courtier. Now that cant be done in anything like the same way.
Few of the visitors will see anything but perfection on show. But behind the polished veneer of the official tour, all is not well.
All theyve been doing in recent times is papering over the cracks, says a courtier. The place is awash with asbestos, which is enormously costly to remove. The 150 million is just an estimate. After the Windsor fire we budgeted for 40 million and it came in at 37 million so you hope the estimate will come down.
This week, aides have talked about the Queen having to quit the Palace while renovations are carried out. This would mean having to find somewhere to hold state banquets, investitures and garden parties.
Other members of the Royal Family, including Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and the Earl and Countess of Wessex, who operate from the Palace, would also have to find another royal base.
The disruption means the Queen would be reluctant to move. There is also, I understand, a more emotional reason behind this reluctance. She is concerned that if she does leave she has no way of knowing when or whether she will ever return, says the courtier.
In particular, she is concerned Prince Philip might never return. She is not spelling it out but she is mindful of her own and Philips great age.
Another factor is the Queens attitude to money. Careful by nature, her first reaction to learning of damage or the need for repairs is to say: How much?
Buckingham Palace has been the Queen's home since she was ten - apart from three years after getting wed
Now 89, her habit of switching off electric lights in empty Palace rooms is well known. Apart from three years as a newlywed when she and Philip lived in Clarence House, Buckingham Palace has been her home since the age of ten.
While Edward VII called it a mausoleum and the Duke of Windsor likened it to a prison, Elizabeth happily took over the old rooms where she had seen her father at work. Many things have remained unchanged ever since.
After artist Michael Noakes was commissioned to paint the Queen, one of the first things she said to him when he arrived in the Yellow Drawing Room was that she really must do something about the curtains. Fabric swatches were ordered and the next time he came the samples were lying on the sofa.
Four years later when I went back to paint her again the samples were still there, he recalled.
And servants still talk, possibly apocryphally, of the story of the torn tapestry. The Queen is said to have noticed some damage to a wall covering and reported it to a footman. The servant took a pair of scissors to the tapestry, slicing off a strip to remove the offending tear. The Queen, I am told, never mentioned it again.
But while her bonds with Buckingham Palace are strong, it is not her favourite home. That is Windsor Castle where, as she gets older, she spends more time.
It is feared that the repairs to Buckingham Palace, pictured, could take at least ten years
Take a look inside Buckingham Palace with the Queen (related)
Her regular routine is to arrive at the Palace at 3pm on Monday and leave on Thursday afternoon. Usually it is for Windsor, but she and Philip also like the solitude of Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk for their weekend breaks. Because of the rhythm of the royal year  in which the Queen is at Sandringham for Christmas and the New Year, at Windsor for Easter, the horse show in May and Royal Ascot in June, and Balmoral in the summer  she spends less than six months at the Palace.
Not long ago some royal advisers were debating whether in these straitened times there was a case for mothballing one or two royal homes. Their thoughts were shaped by Prince Charles, who has let it be known that he thought Buckingham Palace should not be the home of the monarch.
Instead it should house royal offices and also be used as a magnificent venue for official entertaining.
But former royal aide Dickie Arbiter is firmly opposed to such an idea. Buckingham Palace is the symbolic head of monarchy, he says. You wouldnt expect the Pope to move out of the Vatican for a church round the corner. People come to the Palace for garden parties and investitures, and it is a great occasion which no other royal address quite possesses.
As for spending on the repairs, he says: Buckingham Palace is a building of historic importance, so the money has to be spent. Would you let the Tower of London fall down? Or the Palace of Westminster? Of course not.
The Duke of Windsor mournfully noted: One never tinkers with palaces; like museums they seem to resist change. A maxim that could not be more appropriate when applied to Buckingham Palace during the Queens reign.

	Mr Hague, who quit politics at the election, said Greece had no chance of turning its economy around within the single currency unless Germany agreed to hand over big subsidies 'forever'.

Writing in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Hague hit out at European leaders for pushing ahead with the single currency despite warnings that it would trap some countries in permanent recession.
In May 1998 Mr Hague used a speech to warn that some countries in the Euro would find themselves 'trapped in a burning building with no exits'.
The then Tory leader predicted 'wage cuts, tax hikes, and the creation of vicious unemployment blackspots'.
Speaking today Mr Hague said: 'I hope the Eurozone leaders meeting today will remember that those of us who criticised the euro at its creation were correct in our forecasts.

'Otherwise they risk adding to the monumental errors of judgement, analysis and leadership made by their predecessors in 1998.'
Mr Hague said Germany will have to pay Greece 'big subsidies forever' to keep the currency together.
He said that even though the hard-left Syriza government has rejected 'reasonable terms' in return for a bailout the crisis is not the fault of the Greek people.
'Greeks have experienced the loss of one quarter of their entire national income, following an unsustainable inflation of spending and debt which Eurozone membership facilitated.
'The responsibility for this crisis lies with their own former leaders and those around the EU who gave them euro membership when they were not remotely suited to it, a triumph of political desire over dispassionate economic analysis for which ordinary people are now paying the price.
'It is no good now expecting Greeks to sit quietly in a burnt out room of the burning building I described seventeen years ago.'
He urged European leaders to accept that the problem in Greece 'is not a short term crisis, but a permanent one'.
He said the Greeks will not be able to turn round their economy in a 'lifetime' within the Eurozone.
He said: 'This is not because there is something wrong with them; it is because they live in a different economic environment from Germany, and one that is not suited to being in the same currency.
'In such circumstances, it is better to be able to leave sooner, with some generous support, than leave later with even greater resentment and failure.'
But Mr Hague warned the crisis could not be contained in Greece.
He said a 'final truth' was that the crisis 'is not just about one country'.
'Door for talks remains open': Merkel on Greece proposals
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande held crisis talks in Paris last night
Mr Hague warned: 'Across southern Europe, governments such as those in Italy and Spain are making brave efforts to enact long overdue reforms.
'They might not achieve enough, however, for their people to prosper when required to compete equally with their northern neighbours.
'There is a clear risk that the economic performance of the south will diverge from, not converge with, the north.
'Unless this is averted in the coming years, it will bring problems to Europe for which Greece has only been a minor rehearsal.
'In future decades, I believe students will sit down to study the folly of extending a single currency too far.
'Sad though it will be to see it, their textbook is likely to say that the Greek debacle of 2015 was not the end of the euro crisis, but its real beginning.'

The Manhattan Supreme Court has reportedly slapped Gregg Hymowitz, pictured, with a temporary restraining order
A wealthy hedgefunder is at the centre of a  row with his neighbour over plans for a bowling alley in his $23 million townhouse.
Gregg Hymowitz had been excavating the basement of his  Upper East Side home to make way for the new facility.
But Hemant and Varsha Shah claim the digging has damaging their neighbouring property, and say they are now facing a $5million bill for repairs.
A judge has reportedly slapped Hymowitz with a temporary restraining order, according to the Daily Post .
The ruling has stopped all work on the bowling alley until a full hearing can take place at Manhattan Supreme Court.
The Shah's $42 million home was built in 1903 for stockbroker Henry Goldschmid
In court papers they claim the work to Hymowitz's basement has caused the foundations of their 22 room home to shift.
They also alleged that it has caused their basement to fill with water and cracks to appear in the walls and floor of their home.
As a result the Shah's were said to have called in their own structural engineer to their 64th Street home.
It is alleged that the engineer noticed that the excavation of Hymowitz's basement appeared different to the plans submitted in 2013.
The Shah's had been planning to sell their century-old home, which features 10 fireplaces, but have now been forced to pull it off the market, according to the Daily Post.

Both police officers deny the dying woman's allegations. The two men claim that the woman deliberately set fire to herself in a frustrated act of self-immolation.
According to NDTV, the woman told a magistrate and several reporters before she died: 'No one helped me...They all watched.'
According to the dying woman's testimony, she allegedly said that the police officers humiliated her and set her on fire using petrol
'These people used to harass me often. They did it four times. The fifth time, they poured petrol over me and did this,'
Her husband, Ram Narain, told a different story: 'The police took me away and said a murder case had been lodged against me. They told my wife to get money and pick me up.
'I don't know how much they wanted. I was sitting outside when she ran out, engulfed in fire.
'I and some others tried to save her. These people must have set her on fire. Who else could have done it?'
Acccording to the BBC, Mrs Dwivedi was rushed to Lucknow hospital's Trauma Centre, suffering from 80% severe burns to her body. She died at 4am this morning.
The woman's horrific death comes less than a month after Indian journalist Jagender Singh died from severe burns in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh.
Mr Singh ran a popular facebook page, regularly publishing stories about alleged corruption and malpractice. The journalist's stories led to him suffering harassment from the police, his son claims.
In his dying statement, Jagender Singh claimed that four police officers raided his house and set fire to him. Singh accused state minister, Ram Murti Singh Verma, of setting him alight.
A murder investigation was launched and Verma and the four officers were charged with murder.

At present, doctors are obliged to advise the GMC if they are facing criminal prosecution. This may result in a Fitness to Practice hearing, where conditions may be placed on the doctor's ability to practice. In serious cases, they will be erased from the medical register, which means they can no longer legally practice medicine in the UK.
Roger Goss of Patient Concern told the Daily Mirror: 'They're supposed to protect the safety of patients. If they've been calling for this for so long, why have they not succeeded.'
However, Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC claimed some perspective was required when dealing with criminal convictions.
He said: 'We will always push for tough sanctions in response to serious convictions. A driving offence is one thing, a sexual offence is another.'
According to the figures, the most common offence committed by clinicians was drink-driving. There are currently 360 medics on the medical register with convictions for drink-driving.

Former British number one tennis player Greg Rusedski, who has attacked the BBC for sidelining John Inverdale in its Wimbledon coverage
Tennis ace Greg Rusedski has launched a surprise attack on the BBC over its decision to sideline John Inverdale during this years Wimbledon coverage.
The former BBC pundit, 41, branded it a mistake for the corporation to axe Inverdale, 57, from his 14-year run fronting the nightly round-up of the tournaments action.
Once ranked number one in Britain and number four in the world, Rusedski said the highlights programme wont be the same without Inverdales expertise and experience.
And he is reserving judgment on whether the BBCs new highlights show  with Clare Balding, 44, at the helm  will be a success.
Rusedski, who was speaking at the BNP Paribas Tennis Classic at the Hurlingham Club, said: I think John did a great job anchoring the BBCs nightly Wimbledon coverage and now that he has been removed from his role, it wont be the same without him.
Its unfortunate but I guess the people at the BBC want a different formula and Clare Balding is going to be doing her show.
It will be interesting to see how it goes and I just dont know until I see it  to see if it will work. But Clare did a fabulous job at Wimbledon and the rowing.
Once one of the most prominent figures at Wimbledon for the BBC, Inverdale has found himself increasingly sidelined following the furore over his sexist comments about Marion Bartoli during the 2013 tournament, when he told an interviewer: I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12, 13, 14 maybe, Listen, you are never going to be, you know, a looker.You are never going to be somebody like a Sharapova.

Peter Jones, pictured, believes that potential business people are wasting their time in university due the lack of hands' on practical experience
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones has advised school leavers to abandon plans of attending university if they are planning to run their own businesses and instead sign up to his own enterprise academy.
The 49-year-old serial entrepreneur believes that hands-on experience is far more valuable to potential business leaders than several years studying theory in a lecture theatre.
Speaking in advance of the new series of the hit BBC2 show, Jones was highly critical about what was on offer inside the nation's universities.
He told the Daily Mirror: 'For entrepreneurs, university is a complete waste of time. You're not gaining any enterprise experience. To be a doctor you have to go through it. But for an entrepreneur? No.'
One of Jones' latest ventures is a chain of 36 academies across Britain where students study part-time, while still working, to learn about how to succeed in business.
He added: 'We've been brought up in this country to believe entrepreneurship can't be taught. That's absolute hogwash.'
Jones, and existing Dragon Deborah Meaden are joined by three new experts when the show returns on Sunday.
However, in interviews with the Radio Times Magazine, the new line-up - which features Touker Suleyman, Sarah Willingham and Nick Jenkins - refused to divulge any specifics on their personal fortunes.

Happy campers: Margaret Biggs, 77, and Joanne Croxford, 32, who are serving up tea and cake at Glastonbury
They make an unlikely pair of festival-goers  and an even more unlikely advertisement for the Womens Institute.
But great-grandmother Margaret Biggs and tattooed former drug addict Joanne Croxford are sharing a tent at Glastonbury as they attempt to shake off the WIs fusty image by serving tea and homemade cake to hungry revellers.
The organisation, traditionally better known for knitting, jam and Jerusalem, has set up a stall at the Somerset festival for the first time in a bid to recruit younger members.
For 77-year-old Mrs Biggs, who has been a WI member for 40 years, its an opportunity to sleep in a tent for the first time and sample her first Pot Noodle.
And for Miss Croxford, 32, its a chance to give something back to the organisation she says helped her recover from an addiction to drugs such as ecstasy  as well as inspiring some of her inkings.
She now has a number of tattoos based on the core values of the WI, including a teapot, gardening motifs and the wartime slogan of the institute, For home and country.
Miss Croxford, from Cambridge, said: This organisation really has been fundamental to my recovery. For the first time in my life I feel like I belong somewhere.
I fell into drugs when I moved to London aged 18. I took a lot of party drugs to fit in. Then I started working in the fashion industry and used drugs to lose weight.
Now Ive been clean for five years. A big part of that has been the WI. I joined when I lost both of my nans in quite quick succession and wanted to reconnect with that generation.
Now I would say 98 per cent of my friends are other members. Its a fantastic support network. Im friends with a 92-year-old and we have things in common.

The post went viral, spawning thousands of comments as social media seethed with debate about absent fathers and whether being a biological father automatically earns a man the right to be called dad.
Almost Famous actress Kate twisted the knife further by posting an intimate black and white photograph of herself alongside Goldies long-term love Kurt Russell saying: Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Fathers Day. I love you to the moon and back.
The offending tweet: Oliver Hudson posted this picture of his father Bill, and sister Kate on Father's Day

And as if to rub salt into Bills wounds, Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: Happy Fathers Day, Pa.
For Bill, the anguish slowly turned to anger as the headlines raged and his phone rang off the hook.
But he has maintained a dignified silence  until now.
In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill, veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to break all ties with his eldest children.
I say to them now, I set you free, he pronounced, his voice breaking. I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognise Oliver and Kate as my own.
I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name. They are no longer a part of my life. Olivers Instagram post was a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack. He is dead to me now. As is Kate. I am mourning their loss even though they are still walking this earth.

It is a sad denouement to a decades-long family saga which, Bill says, is more messed up and sad than any Hollywood screenplay could ever be.
For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldies claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings.
Last night, in a blistering attack on Goldie, Tinseltowns favourite ditzy blonde, Bill accused her of wilfully alienating him from their two children.
At the heart of the matter is what Bill calls the Hollywoodisation of Goldies story.
When we split up, she never had a bad word to say about me, he says. But when Kurt came on the scene, the narrative changed and I became the big, bad wolf. I would say to her Goldie, why are you trashing me and saying Im an absent father when its simply not the case? and shed laugh and go Oh Bill, you know it makes for a better story.
Eventually, Bill says, the fiction became fact as first Kate, now 36, and then Oliver, 38, drifted away from him and rejected his repeated pleas to remain part of their lives. He lays the blame at Goldies door. I believe the drip, drip, drip of poison which started when they were kids finally took hold, he says. Goldie wanted to create this myth of a perfect family with Kurt and she wanted me out.

Things came to a final showdown a week ago with Olivers bitter post.
That was like a dagger to the heart, says Bill as he sits in the sun-dappled courtyard of a hotel near his ranch home in Malibu, California. Its time for the truth to come out.
At 65, Bill still has the rugged good looks and easy charm that captivated Goldie when she was at the height of her fame. During their marriage, she became the highest-paid female star in the world thanks to quirky comedies such as Shampoo, Theres A Girl In My Soup and Private Benjamin. When the pair met in the first-class cabin of a New York to LA flight in 1975, Bill was a successful star in his own right with his group The Hudson Brothers, (the One Direction of our day, he quips). He had his own TV show and performed alongside The Beach Boys, The Osmonds and The Monkees.
The attraction was instant. I invited her out to dinner that night and that was it. The sex was mind-blowing. Even when everything else in the relationship turned sour, the sex was always amazing.
The pair wed in 1976 when Goldie was already pregnant with Oliver.
When their son was born at LAs Cedars-Sinai hospital, Oliver suffered from the life-threatening condition meconium aspiration, when a newborn accidentally inhales contaminated amniotic fluid.
Oliver was in isolation for three days, says Bill. Goldie and I were beside ourselves. She was really sick and Id go from her bedside to the neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors didnt think Oliver would make it. I was only 26 and in a state of shock.
Goldie and I were sobbing but Oliver pulled through and from that moment he was our precious miracle.
He was my first-born. I adored that child. When Kate came along, I loved her with all my heart, too. There was this deep love among the four of us for years. And thats what makes it so difficult to say goodbye.

Bill says clouds formed in the relationship over his wifes free spirit and desire for an open relationship.
Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldnt imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life.
When Goldie made a film, Cactus Flower, in London, her mother Laura moved into the marital home  a magnificent 10 million beachside villa in Malibu  and helped Bill care for the children.
Oliver was three and Kate four months old. Goldie went to Europe for a month. I stayed home on Daddy duty. I later found out shed been sleeping with one of her co-stars, French actor Yves Rnier.
I wanted a traditional marriage but Goldie couldnt settle. Eventually I moved out.
The marriage ended in 1981. Bill went on to have a long-term relationship with Love Story actress Ali MacGraw, before marrying Cindy Williams, star of TV comedy Laverne &amp; Shirley. They had two children Emily, now 31, and Zachary, 28, before that marriage also ended in divorce.

His youngest child is Lalania, nine, from a long-term relationship with a woman to whom he remains exceptionally close.
Meanwhile, Goldie met Kurt Russell in 1983. And while the pair have never married, their relationship is considered one of the happiest in Hollywood. When we first split up, I took a house on the beach in Malibu to stay close to the kids, says Bill. I was a part of their lives for years. Kate and Oliver came over at weekends, there were family holidays.
In fact, the photograph that Oliver posted on Instagram was taken by Cindy while we were on holiday in Florida. Goldie wanted a vacation with Kurt because theyd just got together and so Cindy and I took the kids to DisneyWorld. Everything was cool.
But he says Goldie used her increasing fame and financial superiority to freeze him out.
I call it parental alienation. We had a custody arrangement but Goldie constantly flouted it. Id turn up to see the kids and would discover Goldie had taken them on the private jet to her home in Colorado.
'She gave interviews about her wonderful relationship with Kurt and how the kids called him Pa. She described me as an absent father. Id call her and go Goldie, how can you say that? but shed just reply: Its a better story. 
As Kates fame grew she, too, accused her father of being an absentee dad: There was never a birthday card, she complained, to which Bill responds: Rubbish! I sent birthday cards every year.
I ring her up every birthday, still do. The same with Oliver. I bumped into Oliver fairly recently in a supermarket in Malibu and he gave me a hug. I always thought Oliver could be the peacemaker, that somehow he would help bring our fractured family back together.

Goldie poisoned them against me. She told the kids Id moved to Portland. I did go to Portland for eight months to make an album but then I came back to LA. I never abandoned my family. I never walked away. I wanted to be a father to Kate and Oliver but Goldie made it harder and harder for me to see them. Its all about control. What Goldie wants, Goldie gets.
He recalled going to mediation during their custody battle. Goldie grabbed my forearm as we were leaving and said to me: Its all about the money and power, babe.
When Oliver and Kate were in their early teens, Bill decided to end the court battles and told the children his door was always open to them. Oliver would come and stay with me. Wed go fishing, have sleep-overs. But Kate drifted away.
The pair enjoyed an uneasy rapprochement when Kate started dating Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson, father of her elder son Ryder, 11. She also has a three-year-old son Bingham with British rocker Matt Bellamy, from whom she split last year after four years.
At one point, I was writing a letter to my children every week for a year. Did those letters ever get to them? Who knows? When I read some of the comments on social media, it was so hurtful. People believe the bull****. Well, Im here to say its just not true. At first, Bill picks his words carefully over Kates Fathers Day photo of herself with Kurt. It was an intimate shot and, as her father, I found it inappropriate and unsettling. Ill leave it at that, he says.

Then, angrily, he adds: She wants to be Kurts daughter? Well then, take his name, stop using mine.
He has removed photographs of Kate and Oliver from his home and even thrown away their knitted baby booties which I carried in the glove compartment of every car Ive ever owned for good luck.
Last week, Oliver posted a reply to one fan in which he was unrepentant, emphasising his closeness to Kurt Russell: What started out as what I thought as a joke has turned into something more. And I embrace that. Ive done and continue to do a lot of work on myself to better understand what make me tick. Yes, science links us but love binds us. OH + KR = 
Bill is clearly still deeply wounded. He says: Oliver could have picked up the phone and called me but he hasnt. What shocks me is that this was clearly premeditated. He chose the photograph and posted it on Fathers Day, when he knew it would cause maximum pain. Oliver has lived in the shadow of his mother and sister all his life. Maybe he wanted to be in the headlines?
If what he wanted was me out of their lives, then hes succeeded. I dont want to see either of my eldest children ever again. Its over.
Goldie Hawn, Kate and Oliver Hudson did not comment last night.

	WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT: Chanttelle Ward, 19, from South Shields is trying to rebuild her life after being attacked by ex-boyfriend Rhys Culley, 24, at her home in February 2014.

'I was physically and mentally abused by my ex. He wouldn't let me wear certain clothes or speak to certain people, I couldn't wear make-up, it was silly things like that which I didn't realise were classed as domestic violence.'
Chanttelle (pictured left) when she was in a relationship withRhys Culley (right). He would control what she wore  and eventually physically attacked her
The teenager was left covered in blood after Culley bit her upper lip. He was found guilty of wounding with intent
In November jurors atNewcastle Crown Court heard how shopfitter Culley attacked Chanttelle in a jealous rage when she tried to leave him last year.
He bit down on her lip with the same force that would be needed to bite through a 1cm-thick piece of rubber.
Shocking pictures of Chantelle's blood splattered face and the stitches she needed helped jurors find Culley guilty ofwounding with intent after he pleaded his innocence.
Chanttelle said she needed counselling to recover and she remains self-conscious about the scars she has been left with.

Chanttelle now wishes she had left Culley earlier, but she didn't realise she was a victim of domestic abuse despite the mental abuse she received
She told presenters Kate Garraway and Susanna Reid this morning: 'He tried to bite my top lip off and it knocked my confidence. I have been left with two scars on my top lip and had to go to counselling for a year to get over the depression. I am trying to rebuild my life now.'
Chanttelle said she wishes she had recognised his behaviour was unacceptable before it was 'too late'.
Chanttelle said the scars have made her self-conscious and she was surprised when she was selected to take part in a beauty pageant
She spoke out on the breakfast TV show as figures released today show that a record number of people in England and Wales are being convicted of violent crimes against women.
There have been increases in the number of successful prosecutions for sexual offences and domestic violence cases, according to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) figures for 2014-15.
In total, some 107,104 defenders who committed violence against women and girls were prosecuted during this time-frame, a rise of 18.3% on the previous year.
Sarah Green, acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'The increase in prosecutions shows that more women are seeking justice with big increases, for example, in the number of rape prosecutions.
'If as a society we really care about ensuring justice for survivors, we should do everything in our power to try to prevent abuse in the first place. This has to start in schools, with compulsory sex and relationships education to give young people the chance to talk about respectful relationships.
'The CPS report includes figures on the alarmingly young age of many defendants in rape prosecutions. This is a call to urgent action.'
The report showed  the highest ever conviction rates for domestic abuse (68,601), rape (2,581), sexual offences (7,591), honour-based violence (129) and child abuse (7,469), with more than 10,000 additional defendants convicted for domestic abuse.
There was a 15 per cent rise in stalking and harassment prosecutions to over 12,000, and of these 1,103 prosecutions were commenced under the new stalking offences.
Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, believed today's report was 'really good news for the victims of these dreadful crimes'.
She said: 'Where cases meet the Code for Crown Prosecutors, we will not shy away from taking cases forward, even when they are difficult and complex.
Chanttelle (pictured before the attack) is feeling like her old, confident self thanks to being selected to represent Sunderland in the Miss North East beauty pageant
Culley of South Shields (pictured during his trial) was jailed for eight years last November
'Of course, this additional volume of violence against women and girls work brings challenges for prosecutors not only in terms of numbers, but the type of cases we are seeing - prosecutors across England and Wales are telling me that we are seeing more non-recent child sexual abuse cases and more of the particularly complex rape cases coming forward.
'Anyone who is a victim of these crimes should feel encouraged by this news and confident that they will be believed when reporting these crimes.'
Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: 'Today's report demonstrates that significant progress has been made in taking more cases of domestic violence through the criminal justice system. This is positive.
'This progress must continue until we have a system where women who experience domestic violence have exactly the same level of confidence as victims of other crimes, that they are heard and believed, the system works for them and protects their human right to live free from violence.'

During the 5.4million eight-month long inquiry, which examined the relationship between the Press and the public, police and politicians, Lord Justice Leveson heard evidence from 224 witnesses.
Part one of the inquiry examined the culture, practices and ethics of the press and the relationship between the press and the public, police and politicians.
Lord Leveson's report (pictured) into Press standards -ore than 250,000 of taxpayers' money spent on lawyers during the inquiry
Part two cannot begin until current police investigations and any criminal proceedings have been completed.
Last night Andy Silvester, campaign director from the Taxpayers Alliance, said: Taxpayers will be left wondering what this expensive inquiry actually achieved, other than lining the pockets of lawyers and putting plenty of innocent journalists in the dock.
The Cabinet Office has refused to name the individuals in receipt of the taxpayer-funded advice.
It raised questions over whether former ministers including Tony Blair - who had his legal advice paid for on the Chilcot Inquiry - received the financial support for their legal advice.

        <MainBody>Soccer-mad Tracey is really on the ball
Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has installed a full-size Subbuteo football pitch in her Whitehall office.
The two teams are Englands 1966 World Cup winners and their West German opponents.
Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has installed a full-size Subbuteo football pitch in her Whitehall office
Crouch is a talented footballer who coaches a schoolgirls team.
Dog hears that acronym-obsessed mandarins cheekily refer to her (behind her back) as BILT thats Bend It Like Tracey.

Plebgate MP Andrew Mitchell has asked Dog to correct our report last week of Tory tycoon Michael Spencers 400,000 bacchanalian bash in Marrakech.
At Mitchs request, we are delighted to point out that fellow Conservative grandee Francis Maude did not parade round the hotel pool in an Arabic style jalabiya, or dishdash robe, looking like a twerp. Maude was in shorts.
No, the partying Tory in the dishdash was Mitchell. Glad to put the record straight.

'Worthless' wannabes
One of, if not the, most venerated of Labours elder statesmen MPs (no more clues) says he will refuse to vote for any of the partys four leadership contenders because they are all useless.
He confided in Dog: Burnhams burnt out, Yvette [Cooper]s wet, Kendalls worth sod-all and Corbyns a clown. We have only ever had two real winners in over a century  Tony Blair and Harold Wilson. None of this lot can hold a candle to them.
A senior Labour figure says all the party's leadership candidates are 'useless', including favourites Andy Burnham (left) and Yvette Cooper (right)

Lib Dem Adrian Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat in the election when his party was reduced to a rump of just eight MPs, refuses to throw in the towel.
Asked if he now felt powerless, Sanders said: No I dont  Castro invaded Cuba with just seven men. Is he Havana laugh?

Justice Secretary Michael Gove will rue the day he lectured mandarins on grammar.
Last week, he congratulated Scots Nat MP Kirsty Blackman on having been educated at Aberdeens Robert Gordons College, the same school as me.
Write 100 lines Master Gove: The same school as I. And learn the difference between an accusative and nominative pronoun.

The new Plymouth MP shot the advert in London before he was elected but after he was chosen to contest the parliamentary seat for Plymouth Moor View in Devon
Mr Mercer had to prepare for the role by shaving his chest and spent hours in the shower to enable camera crews to capture the best footage
In addition to the shower scene Johnny, 38, is seen showing off his strength with his six-year-old daughter Amalie
Mr Mercer said the shoot was 'really fun', adding: 'They sent me and the girls to London for three days.
'Unfortunately, I think it might be the first in a series of adverts but we'll have to wait and see. Hopefully it will be forgotten about quickly.'
After he was nominated to stand for election, the couple got wind that Dove Men were looking to film an advert with an ex-military family and, after being put forward by a friend, decided to make a 'spoof' family video to send onto the marketing agency.
The agency liked what they saw and invited them to London for the shoot.
Even though the clip currently airing on TV in America is only 15 seconds long, wife Felicity Mercer said her daughter and husband shot hours of footage during February half-term in 2014.
She said: 'They made him shave his chest for the shower scene so he spent the week itching which I don't think he enjoyed.
'He had to spend hours in the shower but he was dressed from the waist down, which obviously you can't see.'

Mrs Mercer added: 'It was just something really nice for him and Amalie to do together while me and Joey [their youngest daughter] stood by watching the shooting and editing.
'They really enjoyed it. I don't think Amalie really understood what she was doing until she saw the finished product recently.
'To be honest, once the election campaign kicked-off we didn't think much about the advert but then we received a notification telling us it was on in the States.
'It was an amazing experience and we hadn't done anything like that before.
'I'm really proud of him because it was a father and daughter thing that they shared and I think it was really special.'

	Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin yesterday announced a major u-tun on a major part of the Tories election manifesto admitting that they will not be able to go through with a £38bn Network Rail modernisation plan.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

The Conservatives election manifesto had pledged: We will transform our railway network. We will invest 38billion in our railway network in the five years to 2019. Electrification of the railways is a key part of our investment programme.
The decision to pull the plug on rail schemes in the North and the Midlands, while keeping HS2 and London projects such as Crossrail untouched, puts the Tories rhetoric in doubt. Mr McLoughlin told the Commons that the five-year rail improvement plan needed to be reset because it was now costing more and taking longer. He said electrification work was being paused on the Midland main line between London and Sheffield  where hundreds of millions has already been spent on preparatory work  and on the trans-Pennine Leeds-Manchester route.
The 38.5bn plan is being shelved, while the proposed 50bn HS2, artists impression, will continue
It is understood that the London Crossrail project will also remain unscathed from the planned review

The aim is to keep Network Rails spending within its funding allowance, so that electrification of the Great Western line can be prioritised. Mr McLoughlin announced a shake-up of Network Rail management with the chairman  and former Ford boss  Richard Parry-Jones stepping down.
He will be replaced next month by Londons colourful transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy.
None of Network Rails executive directors will receive a bonus for the past year, Mr McLoughlin said. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne  who will keep his job  admitted they had been overly optimistic about meeting targets.
Labour said the Government knew the scale of the crisis before the election but sought to keep a lid on it to avoid damaging headlines.
In the Commons, Labour transport spokesman Michael Dugher told Mr McLoughlin: You spent the election campaign repeating promises you knew you would break. Ministers may try to shift all the blame to Network Rail, but this happened on the Governments watch.
MP Clive Betts told Radio 4s PM programme: It has been becoming apparent over the past year that costs were going up and timescales were slipping, yet the Government kept this under wraps until after the election.
John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said: This has been covered up for some time. There is a lot of anger that so many people have been misled by all this rubbish about the northern powerhouse. A lot of Tory MPs have been elected under false pretences.
Nigel Harris, editor of Rail magazine, said: There have been clear signs since Christmas that Government is losing patience. And had it not been for a desire to avoid controversial headlines in the run-up to a General Election, the odds are that Network Rail would have been reformed by now in ways it may not have welcomed. There was suppressed Government fury at New Year, following the engineering embarrassments at Kings Cross and Paddington. But pre-election politics ensured a calm face.
Asked whether ministers knew before the election that the scheme was under threat, David Camerons official spokesman did not deny that this was the case. However, a Department of Transport spokesman said: Its not something the Secretary of State has kept hidden.
Tory backbenchers were angry that HS2 was not being cut. Former Cabinet minister Cheryl Gillan said: I have always been worried that major projects such as HS2 would suck the life out of other areas.
If these projects are undeliverable now, what does that mean to the HS2 in a few years time. Will that become undeliverable too?
Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: We have been promised time and time again that the money being pumped into HS2 would not affect the delivery of other infrastructure projects, but its clear that it is now cannibalising the rest of the railway budget and other upgrades with far more robust business plans are being shelved.
The 650,000 boss with a taste for kimonos and call girls: Colourful past of London transport chief tasked with rescuing Britain's rail network
By SAM GREENHILL
He has been credited with keeping Londons transport moving over the past decade.
But Sir Peter Hendy has also been caught up in a scandal that threatened to derail his private life.
Two years ago a 140-an-hour prostitute claimed she had a torrid affair with the 62-year-old transport supremo.
Rachael Grundy said she had a nine-month relationship with Sir Peter, a close ally of London Mayor Boris Johnson, while he masterminded the travel strategy for the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Rachael Grundy, right, who is a 140-an-hour prostitute, claims she had an affair with Peter Hendy, left
Sir Peter, left, is a close associate of Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is also now a Tory MP
Miss Grundy, 42, claimed he contacted her in November 2011 through an escort website. We hit it off immediately, she said.
According to Miss Grundy, he began booking her every week and she regularly stayed the night at Sir Peters London pied-a-terre in Pimlico while his wife was in the West Country.
Before long, they fell in love and she stopped charging him by the hour, but he still gave her money, she said.
He also gave her four Oyster travel passes worth 10 each and a London 2012 badge. She later remarked: He definitely wasnt very romantic when it came to gifts.
She was left heartbroken when Sir Peter dumped her after his wife Sue, 60, found out about their fling.
Sir Peter declined to comment about the affair, except to deny spending any public money on Miss Grundy.
He recently famously branded Britains commuter trains awful and like the Wild West. Yesterday, as he was put in charge of Britains rail network, there were plenty of long-suffering commuters hoping he may hold the ticket to making their daily journeys more comfortable.
Sir Peter, pictured, refused to comment on the affair, only to confirm that no public money was used
Sir Peter wore a silk kimono while on the London underground in order to raise money for Comic Relief
Sir Peter, pictured, earns a taxpayer-funded salary of more than 650,000 and has a house in Bath
He has run Londons complex transport system since 2006. As Transport for Londons commissioner, he is credited with overseeing many improvements and his efforts resulted in a knighthood in 2013.
Sir Peter is familiar with the rail network outside the capital, too, having spent the past ten years travelling regularly between London and the 1.5million Georgian villa in Bath he shares with his wife, an HR consultant and the mother of his two children.
Unlike the squashed-in masses, however, the multi-millionaire enjoys free first class travel  a generous perk earned as a result of an earlier job as a London Transport manager. A colourful character, Sir Peter once took the Tube to work wearing slippers and an elaborate oriental silk dressing gown to help raise money for Comic Relief.
Sir Peter, whose taxpayer-funded salary and bonuses at TfL total more than 650,000, is happy to emphasise his working-class credentials. He sometimes turned up to London Assembly meetings in a bus workers high-visibility jacket and loves to speak in a gravelly Cockney accent  to the amusement of his former classmates at a top public school, Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. And even though his father was a communist firebrand, his mother was the daughter of the 6th Baron Wynford.
The Honourable Mary Best ran away from her familys ancestral home in Dorset and married electrician Jack Hendy. A Communist Party activist and leading member of the Electrical Trades Union, he was caught up in a ballot-rigging scandal and, although cleared by the courts, was banned for life from the union. He studied for a law degree at night school and became a barrister.
Sir Peter has been keen to portray his career as a rags-to-riches rise from lowly London bus conductor to self-made millionaire and transport supremo.
But, having studied economics at Leeds University, he actually began in 1975 as a fast-track graduate trainee with London Transport, which involved a few weeks work experience as a conductor as well as learning how to drive a bus.
He rose swiftly through the ranks and in the late 1980s was appointed director of Centrewest, a subsidiary of the then state-owned London Buses. He led a 34million management buyout in 1995  and his stake was worth 4.8million two years later when the firm was sold for 54million.
Although appointed as commissioner by Red Ken Livingstone, a close ally, Sir Peter quickly adapted to life under his Tory successor Boris Johnson. At one point he concluded: Oddly enough I think I get on better with Boris than I did with Ken. He also noted: I was never as radical as my father. As for Boris, Im not sure Im more Left-leaning than he is.
ALEX BRUMMER: After this shambles HS2 can now be no more than a dream
During the General Election campaign, we heard much from Chancellor George Osborne about building a Northern Powerhouse, and plans for exciting investment in Britains Victorian infrastructure  but little about how it would be delivered.
Meanwhile, Labour and the Greens were mocked for commitments to renationalise all or parts of Britains creaking rail network.
Now, the truth has been revealed. The running of Network Rail  which owns and operates our railways  has been a shambles, electrification of key routes is way behind schedule and is having to be postponed or even cancelled, and the Tory government is being forced to take direct control of the network.
Former Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, pictured, created Network Rail on a not-for-profit basis in 2001 and created an ungainly board including unions, passengers and green groups with weak governance
The Government has been forced to abandon the electrification of the TransPennine Express, pictured
Passengers were left stranded last Christmas when engineering works overran causing chaos
The largest modernisation of the railways since Victorian times was at the heart of the Conservatives long-term plan to secure Britains economic future, to improve productivity and growth. That part of the plan now looks to be in serious trouble, and it is difficult to see how it can easily be rescued at a time when state spending is under pressure.
The real scandal is that the slide into chaos of the Governments promised 38.5billion investment programme must have been known to civil servants and the Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin before the country went to the polls on May 7, but not a word crossed anyones lips.
Instead, the nation was treated to a naively optimistic view of a nation determined to revitalise rail travel. Plans included electrification of the TransPennine Express running between Manchester, Leeds and York; improvements of the Midland mainline linking London and Sheffield, and most significantly of all, the vanity HS2 project  estimated to cost up to 42.5billion.
As a result of the new announcements by McLoughlin, several of the key projects are being paused and mothballed, and there must be real questions as to whether the highly contentious HS2 should be, or will be, undertaken.
The immediate trigger for the Governments shake-up of Network Rail is the mayhem that has been endured by passengers. This was symbolised by the engineering works at Kings Cross station that overran during the last Christmas break, forcing passengers of the East Coast, Thameslink &amp; Great Northern lines to use inadequate Finsbury Park station in North London, which became dangerously over-crowded.

There have to be real questions over whether the HS2, artists impression, will ever go ahead
The holiday season pandemonium is just a microcosm of what many rail travellers have to suffer every day, with standing room only, unexplained delays and replacement bus services, and fares that rise inexorably despite the big taxpayer subsidies.
At the root of these problems was the then Labour Transport Secretary Stephen Byers decision in 2001 to place Railtrack into administration and replace it with a not-for-profit new firm Network Rail, run by an ungainly board of members drawn from all sections of society, from the trades unions to passengers and green groups.
The bizarre structure made for weak governance, which saw rail chieftains rewarding themselves like captains of industry but failing miserably to deliver the services the public craved. Labour eventually had to pay compensation to the Railtrack shareholders.
The impossible governance structure allowed the top brass at Network Rail to enjoy riches beyond the dreams of avarice. Chief executive Mark Carne has a base salary of 675,000 and was forced to forgo a bonus of 135,000 for 2014 (a sum almost equal to the Prime Ministers pay of 142,500) after the Christmas chaos. He is just one of a bunch of Network Rail executives whose pay, bonuses and pensions hover around the 1million mark.
This is nothing compared to the pay of some of the operating companies, with David Brown of Go-Ahead group which runs London-Midland, Southern and South-Eastern, earning a shade under 2million.
One of the immediate results of the changes just unveiled is that finally, after years of dissatisfaction with the way in which Network Rail has been governed, the byzantine structure is being abolished forthwith.
Instead, there is to be rule from Whitehall, with the former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown being parachuted in as Special Director of Network Rail and reporting directly to the Transport Secretary. Brown will work alongside the colourful Sir Peter Hendy, the new Network Rail chairman, who is credited with running the London Underground on time during the Olympics.
What is absolutely clear from the changes and the review that has been unveiled is that under the chairmanship of Richard Parry-Jones, who is to step down, Network Rail lost control of the costs of one of the governments most high-profile infrastructure projects.
As chief executive, Mark Carne admits the projects which Network Rails been charged with delivering are going to take longer and cost more than we originally thought.
The Governments promise to spend 38.5 billion on railways over five years does not seem to be at risk. What will be affected is the ambition to create a 21st-century electrified rail system to empower the North of England and improve the links with the capital.
Whatever the outcome of the Governments review  it is promising decisions by the autumn  the imbroglio raises huge questions over the future of the HS2 project, connecting London to Manchester and running through some of Britains most unspoiled landscaped in the Chilterns; and HS3, designed to go East-West across the North of England connecting Manchester to Hull.
If the relatively simple task of modernising and electrifying some of the busiest rail links in the country cannot be achieved  despite a generous infrastructure budget  then the high-speed projects can be no more than a pipedream.
As for long-suffering commuters and business travellers, the pain of rail travel will continue.
Direct control from Whitehall may be an improvement on the old Network Rail, but it cannot be the right long-term solution. Until the private enterprise disciplines of cost controls, efficient engineering and delivery of projects on time are brought to the rail network, the taxpayer will not get value for money.

	The consumption of dog and cat meat is outlawed under the Contagious Diseases Act, which deems the meat unsafe due to the risk of fatal diseases like rabies.

Although there is little scientific proof that dog meat is sufficiently better for the human diet, dog meat remains particularly popular with some people from Thailand's ethnic Vietnamese community, predominantly found in rural areas of the country.
In recent years, there has been a crackdown on the dog meat trade in Thailand, leading smugglers to adopt new strategy to bypass the police.
Undercover investigators witnessed the scene, where over 100 dog carcasses were discovered
The dog's skins are usually removed and sold separately. The skin is sometimes used to make golf gloves
Dog traders have previously used the legal dog meat trade in Vietnam, transporting their cargo from Thailand, via Laos, to Vietnam
Dog meat can be found on sale in more rural parts of Thailand despite the recent crackdowns on the trade
Police used to be able to follow the barks of the distressed dogs and track down the delivery lorries, often heading via Laos to Vietnam, where dog meat is legal.
Following a rise in new arrests, smugglers have started to slaughter dogs before throwing the skinned carcasses into a lorry and transporting the sickening delivery late at night to avoid detection.
Dog skin has been known to be made into items like golf gloves in countries like Vietnam.
Dog meat traders traditionally used to transport the dogs alive, cramping up to 10 dogs into cages, leading to many dogs dying from suffocation and dehydration.
The live transportation of dogs was done in the belief that when the dogs arrived at the market and were slaughtered, the meat would be more tender.
The majority of Thai civilians are avid dog lovers, with only a small proportion of people favouring dog meat
Stray dogs and aggressive dogs are often snatched or sold to dog meat traders
Police are finding it harder to track down dog meat smugglers, having previously been able to follow the sound of a dog bark. Now smugglers have turned to slaughtering and transporting their cruel cargo at night
Two laws have been introduced to crackdown on the dog meat trade in Thailand.
Thailand'sNational Legislative Assembly (NLA) passed the country's first Animal Welfare Law in December 2014, voted in by 188-1, with four members abstaining from the vote.
The landmark law now means that it is a legal requirement for animal owners to provide suitable facilities and care for their animals.
According to the Bangkok Post, the first major arrest under the Animal Welfare Law, came on 29 December inTueng district, Chiang Rai province.
The Contagious Diseases Act has also been introduced, designed to outlaw the consumption of dog meat. Under the Act, dog meat can lead to a fine of up to10,000 baht (189), a large amount for a poor family in rural Thailand.
The Act was passed to clamp down on the dog meat trade as well as reduce the spread of rabies through a crackdown on the transportation of live dogs in and across the country's border.

In the interview she said: 'I think that being in love with my girlfriend is a big part of why I'm feeling so happy with who I am these days.
'It took me a long time to accept the idea [of being gay], until I first fell in love with a girl at 20 and recognized that I had to accept it.
'But I have erotic dreams only about men...The thing is 'if I ever found a guy I could fall in love with, I'd want to marry him and have his children.'
In the July 2015 issue, author of the piece, Rob Haskell, paraphrased the model claiming that her family believe the bisexuality is nothing more than a phase.
Haskell wrote for Vogue : 'Her parents seem to think girls are just a phase for Cara, and they may be correct.'
The interview appeared in the July issue of US Vogue, which featured Cara, 22, as its cover star
In the interview written by Rob Haskell, it was also suggested that Cara only formed relationships with women as a result of childhood trauma

He continued: 'When I suggest to Cara that to trust a man, she might have to revise an old and stubborn idea of hers - that women are perennially troubled and therefore only women will accept her - her smile says she concedes the point.'
Care2 petition author Julie Rodriguez says it's wrong of Haskell to equate same-sex relationships with childhood trauma or to characterise it as a phase.
Those signing the petition are hoping to catch the attention of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour
She said: 'The idea that queer women only form relationships with other women as a result of childhood trauma is a harmful (and false) stereotype that lesbian and bisexual women have been combating for decades.
'How could Vogue's editorial staff greenlight this article and publish it without anyone raising concerns about this dismissive and demeaning language?'
Many of those who have signed the Care2 petition added comments next to their signatures:
James Ferguson wrote: 'Dear Vogue, I have been in a queer 'phase' for the entire 50 years of my life. I think it is much more than a phase for millions of us.
'And I would have thought that you would know better than to perpetuate such dismissive, demeaning, and harmful stereotypes. I am deeply disappointed and believe a full, prominent apology is the very least that you can do for your readership.'
Robert Wallace added: 'My daughter is gay and it is NOT a phase; it is an integral part of who she is and I love and accept her, for who she is!'
Michelle Sorensen said: 'As a longtime subscriber to Vogue, I am very disappointed in the lack of empathy and care that Rob Haskell shows in his interview with Cara DeLevingne.
'Surely Mr. Haskell is a better listener, interviewer, and writer than this piece of his demonstrates. Vogue has made efforts to support the LGBT community; however, allowing this article to go to print makes me question how sincere this support is on their behalf.
'Vogue, please apologize for publishing such a careless and offensive piece in your pages. Thank you.'
A  Vogue spokesperson declined to comment.
MailOnline has also contacted MissDelevingne's representatives for comment.

An article on May 27 said that burglar Wayne Bishop had been released early from prison so that he could look after his five children on the grounds that their rights were more important than the rights of his victims. We are happy to make clear that the judgment in fact weighed the childrens rights against the seriousness of Bishops offences and not against the victims rights.
A graphic accompanying a news item published in one edition yesterday wrongly stated that the cost of Prince Harrys 2014 visit to Brazil and Chile was 185,626. In fact, as the article itself stated, the trip cost 85,626.

The alarm was raised at the Eurotunnel terminal in France in the early hours causing a partial closure of the tunnel.
Kent Police said delays were building around junction 11a of the M20, where lorries are queued as part of Operation Stack when cross-Channel services hit disruption.
The migrant crisis in Calais has escalated in recent months, with around 3,000 people displaced from countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan setting up camp near the port.
Last week, more than 3,000 truckers had to queue for several days in high temperatures on the M20 following a wildcat strike by ferry workers in France.

Freight traffic was being disrupted but there were also delays to passenger services following the intrusion near Calais in the early hours of the morning, Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel said (file picture)
Industrial action by ferry workers this summer has come on top of the problems faced by hauliers with migrants desperately trying to clamber on board their HGVs to the UK.
French authorities have faced claims they are not doing enough to safeguard lorry drivers from intimidation, violence and attempts by migrants to climb on.
The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has suggested deployment of the French military to boost security in Calais amid fears that a fatality could occur.
The Fresh Produce Consortium estimates that 10 million of fresh fruit and vegetables have been thrown away since the start of the year as a result of the problems in Calais.
And Port of Dover officials said last week's ferry strike cost the UK economy 1billion.
They have joined calls for 'robust contingency plans' to be introduced to ensure the port  a 100 billion trade route  can work unimpeded by others.
Home Secretary Theresa May and her French counterpart Bernard Cazeneuve last week agreed to increase the joint intervention fund to improve security around the port and the Channel Tunnel.
French aid workers have reported a 'catastrophic' situation, with predictions that 2,000 more migrants could arrive over the summer at the camp, dubbed Jungle II.
Volunteers from L'Auberge Des Migrants say up to 50 new migrants are arriving every day at the camp, and there are not enough tents, blankets or food.
Dover Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has said the problems underlined the need to consider expanding the port at Dunkirk, 45 miles from Calais.

Most spend half our lives in search of an internet connection
In the summer of 2000 I was on holiday in Jamaica, staying in Ian Flemings villa, Goldeneye.
It was the middle of the night, and I was in a rage because I couldnt find a phone socket to connect to the internet, which meant I couldnt file my copy.
In those days, you had to take a phone lead, and a different phone socket converter for every country (the socket for Milan was so huge it meant packing one less pair of shoes), before dialling up the internet.
I was crawling around the villa using a torch, as I didnt want to wake my boyfriend. It wasnt long before an armed security guard turned up, convinced I was being burgled. Which in a way I was: of my holiday and my sanity and my relationship.
My life since then has been one long, frantic quest for internet connection. In the foothills of the Himalayas, on a small island off Mozambique, in refugee camps in Haiti and on the border of Somalia, in a village in Bangladesh, in an earthquake zone in Pakistan, in a tent in Glastonbury.
I even had my phone screen held above my eyes when I came round from a general anaesthetic, just in case some awful tragedy had occurred while I was under.
I filed copy from my honeymoon, and even got my husband to read me the news headlines after undergoing laser eye surgery because I was wearing a metal grill over my eyes for 24 hours. My only respite was when on board a plane. This in turn made me phobic about air travel: not the flying or crashing part, but the safe landing, when I would switch on my smartphone and all manner of worrying emails would pop into the inbox.
Now even that brief holiday from being invited to Plan your funeral or Your Barclaycard statement is now ready or VAT to the quarter ending no longer exists, as you can use the internet on the plane. I have my smartphone and iPad with me everywhere  in the bath, horse riding, in bed, at my mums funeral  and it has become a ticking bomb of stress in my pocket when yet another email pops up that says, Are you OK? Have you read. and so I log on to some hateful remark, or read of some dreadful atrocity somewhere in the world.

	Mark Rouse, 48, of Southsea, Hampshire, who dodged paying for a permit for up to six months, has been jailed for 16 weeks for making the fake copy of a temporary permit he was given.

When it expired after six weeks he did not qualify for a free permanent permit as the Citroen C4 car he drove was not registered in his name.
Instead of buying 90p-a-day visitor permits which would have allowed him to continue to park on the street, Rouse made a fake permit on his computer using his expired temporary one as a template.
But the forgery was spotted by a parking officer and Rouse was confronted at his home by a council investigator, at which point he admitted using the counterfeit permit for up to six months.
Rouse admitted to one offence under the Fraud Act 2006, and one under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 at Portsmouth Magistrates Court on June 17.
Councillor Ken Ellcome, cabinet member for traffic and transportation, said: 'Residents of many streets in Portsmouth value their permits because they mean it's possible to park near their homes.
'Forging a pass is an attempt to cheat the system and claim a parking space that is not yours - stopping other people using it. I hope the sentence will deter other potential fraudsters.'
Forgery: Instead of buying 90p-a-day visitor permits which would have allowed him to continue to park on the street, Rouse made a fake permit (above) on his computer using his expired temporary one
AndCouncillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who has previously campaigned against charges being introduced for parking permits in the city, told MailOnline: 'Parking is a real problem in Portsmouth.
'Therefore if people are not playing by the rules, then people get really upset about that. If there are rules, people need to stick to them.'
But some local residents were angered by the length of the sentence.Gary Claus said: 'Is it just me or does anyone else think this is an unnecessarily harsh sentence considering much worse crimes often go with a lesser sentence?'
And Lloyd Chappell added: 'If you look at today's court round up with the crimes committed and sentences given, this is plainly ridiculous. I'm gobsmacked. This has to be overturned.'

Gerald Vernon-Jackson, councillor
However, RAC head of external affairs Pete Williams told MailOnline: 'Although on the face of it the sentence might appear harsh, the actions of this individual are classed as fraud which can carry very heavy sentences. Motorists, take note.'
Last night, neighbours of Rouse came to his defence. Stephen Ayub, 53, who runs a boat yard, said: 'I think it is a bit harsh to jail him.
'It is hardly the biggest crime in the world  we are talking about parking. There are plenty of people who do not get jailed for things like stealing and vandalism.'
Lloyd Chappell added: 'If you look at today's court round-up with the crimes committed and sentences given, this is plainly ridiculous.
'I'm gobsmacked. This has to be overturned.'
Trevor King, 53, an engineer, said: 'I have lived here for some time and I like being by the shops  but the parking is annoying.
'The shoppers will try all the side roads before they go to the supermarket's car park.
'Now the council are talking about making you pay for the permit for your first car, which is free at the moment, when you live in an area where you cannot guarantee a parking space.'

	Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found by preventing the protein kinase from working, the malaria parasite was killed and the disease stopped in its tracks.

The researchers used state-of-the-art methods to dissect the  pathways involved in keeping the malaria parasite alive.
They used an approach called chemical genetics, where synthetic chemicals are used in combination with introducing genetic changes to the DNA of the parasite.
This is a real breakthrough in our understanding of how malaria survives in the blood stream and invades red blood cells
Professor Andrew Tobin

They found that one protein kinase, PfPKG, plays a central role in various pathways that allow the parasite to survive in the blood.
They explained that understanding the pathways the parasite uses means that future drugs could be precisely designed to kill the parasite.
This could be done with limited toxicity, making them safe enough to be used by children and pregnant women.
Study co-lead author Professor Andrew Tobin, from the MRC Toxicology Unit at Leicester University, said: 'This is a real breakthrough in our understanding of how malaria survives in the blood stream and invades red blood cells.
'We've revealed a process that allows this to happen and if it can be targeted by drugs we could see something that stops malaria in its tracks without causing toxic side-effects.'
Professor David Baker, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'It is a great advantage in drug discovery research if you know the identity of the molecular target of a particular drug and the consequences of blocking its function.
'It helps in designing the most effective combination treatments and also helps to avoid drug resistance which is a major problem in the control of malaria worldwide.'
Malaria is caused by a parasite that lives inside an infected mosquito and is transferred into humans through bites. Pictured is a female mosquito engorged with human blood
Malaria currently infects more than 200 million people worldwide and accounts for more than 500,000 deaths per year, according to the World Health Organisation.
Professor Patrick Maxwell, chair of the MRC's Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board, said: 'Tackling malaria is a global challenge, with the parasite continually working to find ways to survive our drug treatments.
'By combining a number of techniques to piece together how the malaria parasite survives, this study opens the door on potential new treatments that could find and exploit the disease's weak spots but with limited side-effects for patients.'
The findings were published in the journal Nature Communications.

        <MainBody>British blackcurrants contain higher levels of health-boosting compounds than trendy blueberries, researchers find
New research challenges belief that blueberries are ultimate health berry
Blackcurrants have six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants

For years, the health-conscious have sworn by the benefits of blueberries  a trendy import from the Americas.
But it seems there is something far better for us, much closer to home  the blackcurrant.
Researchers have found that the sharp berry, bushes of which used to be a regular feature in British gardens and allotments, contain far higher levels of health-boosting compounds than the blueberry.
researcher Dr Gordon McDougall of the James Hutton Institute near Dundee found blackcurrants can contain six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants of cultivated blueberries
We now eat tons and tons of blueberries, having been convinced they are a superfood that are particularly rich in polyphenols. These are naturally occurring antioxidant compounds said to help combat the development of heart disease and even cancer.
By contrast, fresh blackcurrants are a rarity on supermarket shelves. But researcher Dr Gordon McDougall of the James Hutton Institute near Dundee found blackcurrants can contain six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants of cultivated blueberries.
And exercise physiologist Matthew Cook of Chichester University has discovered that blackcurrants can even boost athletic performance.

She told the inquest: 'My daughter had got her iPad and tried to get in touch with various family members to tell them something was wrong with her brother.
'I finished work at 11pm and my mother was due to pick me up, I had missed phone calls and when I tried to ring back they didn't answer.
Bright future: Joshua, pictured, was described by his family as 'very positive and inspirational'
'I then got a call from my brother who told me to come home, he told me Joshua had been in an accident.
'I started panicking and running home but the police came and picked me up. As I arrived home it became apparent that something very bad was occurring.
'Joshua could be socially awkward but he was absolutely normal in every sense of the word. He was very into physical fitness and we got him a training machine which he put up in his bedroom.
'I had never watched him train upstairs but he had fixed a onesie on there. My daughter said he did it all the time.
'Reflecting back to when I told his friends how he died, they knew what I meant straight away and said it was not an uncommon thing for him to do.'
Joshua's grandmother Karen Harrison told the hearing: 'He was very sensitive to other people's feelings, he was hardworking and a loving child. He was bright, funny and we had a giggle.
'On the day it happened he was chatting away about athletic things and how excited he was about going seeing other universities. We had a really good day.
'I spoke to him at 9.30pm because he was worried about his mum getting home on her own so I rung him to tell him I would go and pick her up. I had no concerns, he was laughing at me for ringing him.
'It was about 10:30pm I got the call. We all arrived at the same time and I went into Joshua's room and we all tried to help him before the paramedics arrived.
'He never expressed any views to me about wanting to harm himself. He ate like a horse every day and you couldn't feed him enough.'
Emma Armitage, learning support and safeguarding manager at Salford City College said: 'He was known to the sports department, he impressed us all and stayed beyond the time he was supposed to, he was very helpful as well. There was not a problem with his understanding of it at all. He was the model student.
'He was able to make his classmates laugh with his unique sense of humour. He wanted to learn, not just about the physical but the psychological too.
'He was definitely working towards a distinction grade. He was very friendly, very bubbly and from the start he told me he was going to get an A. He was on track.
On track: The schoolboy, pictured right and left with his mother, who was studying for an A Level in sports psychology at Salford City College, had his 'future mapped out' and was planning on visiting universities
'He was confident and wanted to do well, he said to me 'I'm going to achieve the best results ever at college'
'He never seemed to be a pupil who was a danger to anybody and there was nothing negative recorded about him at all. He was the staff's pupil but he was also considered a friend.'
Det Insp Cheryl Hughes of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We investigated the background issues and there was nothing at all that caused any concerns. His bedroom was quite messy - but it was a typical teenager's bedroom.'
'I saw the exercise frame, there was a onesie tied to it and nothing else on the machine. We made some enquiries as to why it was there, we looked into it to see if we could see any evidence on the internet and saw that this could be used as a resistance band.That is something they do with things that can create that resistance.'
He was definitely working towards a distinction grade. He was very friendly, very bubbly and from the start he told me he was going to get an A. He was on track
Emma Armitage, Salford City College
Recording a verdict of accidental death Stockport coroner John Pollard said: 'I think it was an accident and I think he lost consciousness very quickly.
'If this was intentional then messages on Facebook and other social media would have probably been found but there was nothing. No one was concerned about him and he was a model student. I rule out a deliberate intention.'
In a statement after the hearing, Joshua's family said: 'Joshua was a very positive, inspirational, bright young person, who strived for perfection in everything he set out to achieve. A warm, caring and witty individual, Joshua easily endeared himself to everyone he encountered.'
'His tenacity for life, the dedication showed, both in his academic achievements and his love for athletics meant that he very much had the world at his feet and was there for the taking.'
'This Summer Joshua wanted to visit various universities, as in his mind his future was mapped out.
'Joshua was well liked and respected amongst his peers, friends and tutors; all of which are devastated by his tragic passing.'
'As a family we are absolutely devastated by this loss. He was a wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and cousin and his absence is felt every day.
'It is both every parents, and families worst nightmare, and we struggle daily to move forward from this.'
'There is absolutely no doubt in our minds that Joshua's death was nothing more than a tragic accident. Joshua striving once again for physical excellence, with devastating consequences.'

Early in 1950 he was invited to travel to Canada by friend David Greene, a director friend at CBC in Toronto, and he left England within 48 hours to work overseas.
Despite his typically English exteriror, Macnee actually spent a large part of his adult life working in the U.S., taking minor roles on American TV shows.
He only returned to the UK in the 1960s in order to take on his defining role as John Steed as The Avengers began shooting in London.
Macnee's character appeared in all but two episodes, accompanied by a string of beautiful women who were his sidekicks.
Macnee was educated at Eton and served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, which turned out to be perfect preparation for the part of John Steed - who was also supposed to have studied at Eton, and fought against the Nazis
While Macnee's co-stars  (pictured here with Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt in The New Avengers) often used guns, John Steed never wielded a weapon and was known for his skill with an umbrella
Despite being a sex symbol, Macnee said he missed missed most of the Swinging Sixties due to being locked in a studio filming from 5.30am to 9.30pm five days a week

The most popular was likely Diana Rigg, who played sexy junior agent Emma Peel from 1965 to 1968. Honor Blackman played Catherine Gale from 1962 to 1964, and Linda Thorson was Tara King from 1968 to 1969.
In his final interview in The Lady magazine, he was asked which of the three he found the most appealing.
He replied: 'The very first thing you learn if you're a gentleman is that you never compare one woman to another. That's the way of all death.
'You get a big pointed high heel in your groin and you'll never walk again!'
However, in a follow-up interview in 2010 he was rather less discreet, saying:Honor was adorable. She was the most beautiful of them all.
'A gorgeous blonde with the biggest breasts youve ever seen and beneath them the beautiful athletic body of a runner.
Of Diane Rigg, he said: She was probably one of the best actresses.She made The Avengers the enormous success it was because she was in the first episodes made for American TV when they hadnt seen a woman in a skintight leather catsuit throwing men around.
Linda Thorson was a great actress with a great body but she arrived just as The Avengers was losing its appeal.
Macnee was married three times and first tied the knot aged 19 toBarbara Douglas, with whom he had two children. He went on to marryCatherine Woodville (pictured) andBaba Majos de Nagyzsenye
Sir Roger Moore has led tributes to Macnee, saying:'So very sad to hear Pat MacNee has left us. We were mates from the 1950s and I have so many happy memories of working with him. A true gent'
Speaking about his role as a surprise Sixties sex symbol, he added:  I missed so much of the Swinging Sixties by working.
From 1961 to 1969 I got up at 4.30am, a car came for me at 5.30am and I was taken to our studio at Teddington or Elstree and we filmed until I got home at 9.30pm, five days a week.
'I spent most of the Sixties in a giant shed filming even though I lived around the corner from the Kings Road in Chelsea.
After the original show finished in 1969, Macnee became a frequent guest on television talk shows around the world, famed for his traditional British humour and intelligence.
He went on to star in Bond film A View To A Kill alongside Roger Moore, as well as The Howling and The Sea Wolves, which Moore also starred in.
Author and playwright Bonnie Greer added: 'When I was a kid, some folks were 'one of us' - Leonard Nimoy and Patrick Macnee. Dude of dudes. RIP Patrick Macnee.'
Goodness Gracious Me actor Sanjeev Bhaskar paid a warm tribute to Macnee on Twitter, saying: 'RIP Patrick Macnee. The Avengers also warm and wonderful foil to Sir Roger Moore in several films and Spinal Tap. Epitome of the British Gent.'
After The Avengers, Macnee continued to appear on stage and screen, starring opposite Roger Moore in James Bond movie A View To A Kill
Raised in Lambourn, Berkshire, Macnee spent the last 40 years of his life at his home in Coachella Valley in California, where he died today with his family by his bedside
He took a turn on stage in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth, which saw him take off on an international tour, and also penned two books based on The Avengers, alongside an autobiography.
In the 70s he returned to television in order to reprise the character of John Steed in The New Avengers, alongside Joanna Lumley and Gareth Hunt.
He guest-starred and played continuing roles in numerous American, British and Australian television productions.
He recorded numerous audio books, including thirteen Jack Higgins titles, and voice-over narrations for the four hour mini-series 'America at War in Color' and many others.
Musing on life during an interview five years ago, aged 88, Macnee said: Im not afraid of death. Whats to fear? Once youre dead, thats it. Nothing.
'I dont believe in heaven or hell. Thats baloney. What matters is the here and now. Yes, Im 88 and there are things I cant do: I cant run a race or climb Everest. But isnt life magnificent?
He was married three times but pre-deceased by all his wives. He is survived by two children and one grandchild.

	As the manager of a local brothel said, when the
Iran talks are in town, 'business is booming'. He declined to say who were his most frequent customers were, however.

Vienna's Palais Coburg hotel, a 19th-century palace, has hosted most rounds of the talks since February 2014, and for all that time rumours have circulated about a network of underground tunnels connecting it to brothels and other establishments.
One Western diplomat said they could be just Iran-talks folklore inspired by Carol Reed's classic 1949 film noir 'The Third Man', which features a chase scene through Vienna's sewer system.
Some negotiators opt for a different kind of leisure activity anyway. One took a day off from haggling over uranium centrifuges and the legal technicalities of U.N. inspections to cycle 70 km along the Danube River - seemingly undeterred by the bicycle crash that put U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on crutches in May, the day after a nuclear meeting with Iran's foreign minister in Geneva.
At work: German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Foreign Minister of France Laurent Fabius, and  Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China Wang Yi converse during the nuclear talks yesterday
Other diplomats shed their business attire and enjoyed a splash in the public pools.
But their impatience is clear. 'These talks have become obsessional,' said one. 'I'd quite like to do something else now. It's enough to make you go crazy.'
Like the food, for instance. Luxury hotel or not, after 10 days of the same lunch buffet, it starts to get repetitive; the Iranian delegation has taken to bringing in main courses from a local Persian restaurant.
Keeping busy: Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Mohammad Javad Zarif attends the talks yesterday
The talks were supposed to finish by June 30 but, days before the deadline, one delegation was already joking in a beer garden in Vienna's 'Stadtpark' about 'Groundhog Day', the 1993 film about a man who relives the same day over and over again. Sure enough, the talks were extended by another week.
With energy needing to be saved for the long haul, the closest local DIY and garden store rapidly sold out of folding picnic chairs, which have become essential equipment for reporters staking out the talks.
As daytime temperatures have soared towards 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), keeping cool can be difficult.
Many television crews and photographers and a few correspondents are decked out in shorts and t-shirts and, in an attempt to cool the tempers of grumpy reporters, the Austrian Foreign Ministry has been supplying free ice cream.
At least once a day, a ministry employee wheels a cart full of lollies and cones into the media tent, calling out 'Achtung, attention please!' to get the journalists with their laptops to clear a space - before the predictable scrum empties the cart of all but a few unpopular varieties.
But that's still not enough to get some of the reporters through their day.
'I've run out of words,' said a French-language reporter. 'I used my last ounce of strength &#127;to do a story this morning. How many different ways can you say 'inched towards a deal'?'
For an Italian journalist in the tent, where temperatures soared above 40 Celsius after the air conditioning broke down, it was all too much.
Power: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (second left) and British Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond (third left) attends the nuclear talks between the E3+3 group and Iran in Vienna yesterday
John Kerry: Iran nuclear talks could go either way
'You're an idiot!' he screamed down the phone to his editor, 'A moron! A moron! A moron!' And then he hung up.
One local reporter suggested to his foreign minister that keeping foreign correspondents cooped up in a stifling tent might be encouraging them to send home the wrong message about Austrian hospitality.
The minister, fresh-faced 28-year-old Sebastian Kurz, took the warning to heart and invited foreign reporters to Sunday brunch at his ministry, rather improbably making peace among nations in the process.
Iranian reporters came along - even though some of them were unable to enjoy the Viennese pastries because they were fasting for the holy month of Ramadan - and quickly found themselves rubbing shoulders with Israeli journalists, abandoning their usual reciprocal frostiness in the rush to get a 'selfie' with the minister.

By contrast, only 5,460 or four per cent of students had ended up in these menial elementary occupations six months after graduating in 2007.
In 2013/14, 68 per cent of employed graduates were in professional jobs such as working as managers, directors, senor officials and in technical occupations.
Graduates are also faced with earning an average salary of just 21,500 after leaving university, despite courses now costing 9,000-per-year (file image)
The average salary six months after graduation was 21,500.
Frances OGrady, general secretary of the TUC, yesterday attacked the poor job prospects for some graduates.
He said: For many university leavers, the prospect of finding a job that matches their talents is gloomy.
Despite paying huge amounts to get a higher education, many are being forced to take on lower-skilled jobs, which is in turn pushing those who dont have a degree out of the labour market altogether.
Young people are simply not getting the opportunities they deserve. If we don t create better jobs for graduates we wont be able to build the higher-skilled workforce the UK desperately needs to boost productivity and compete with other countries.
The governments economic plan is failing to solve this career gridlock, but action is urgently needed. Bemoaning the lack of decent graduate jobs is becoming an annual event.
A report warned last year that the growing number of workers who are over-qualified for their role is largely the result of a huge expansion in univeunrsity education.
The centre-left think-tank the Institute for Public Policy research (IPPR) said the number of high-skilled jobs has not kept pace with the rate at which workers are becoming more highly qualified.
School-leavers would be better prepared for the job market by doing an apprenticeship instead of racking up huge debts at university, the report claimed.

	Two-thirds of hay fever sufferers also battle symptoms at NIGHT

	As pollen levels peak this weekend, experts warn people who suffer from what pharmacists have labelled ‘insneezia’ to close their windows at night.

Whilst its impossible to avoid grass and other pollens, if you are taking the right preventer medicines  you should be able to manage day-to-day without getting any asthma symptoms.
But she added: If you are wheezing, coughing, waking at night or feel tightness in your chest now then you need to speak to your GP or asthma nurse.
Some 18million people in Britain have hayfever.
Research by Boots suggests 64 per cent find their symptoms affect their sleep.
When pollen levels peak, experts warn people who suffer from what pharmacists have labelled insneezia to close their windows at night
In a poll of 2,080 sufferers, the average sleep loss was 72 minutes of sleep each night when pollen levels are high.
Boots pharmacist Angela Chalmers said: Falling pollen at night doesnt have to get in the way of a good nights sleep if you take steps to keep your hayfever symptoms in check before your head hits the pillow.
Most one-a-day anti-histamines are usually a 24-hour dose, so taking your daily dose at least three hours before you go to bed may help reduce symptoms throughout the night.
The NHS advises that people keep windows shut at night and first thing in the morning, and also suggests sufferers stay indoors as much as they can when the pollen count is high.
Despite the impending misery, Dr Emberlin, speaking on behalf of Opticrom Hayfever Eye Drops, said there are steps hayfever sufferers can take to ease their symptoms...
KNOW YOUR ALLERGY TRIGGERS
Dr Emberlin, said: 'It helps to know your allergy triggers.
'Keep a diary with notes about when and where your symptoms occur.
Experts advise trying to avoid going out when the pollen count is high if you suffer from hayfever
'Match it against a pollen calendar to see what is in the air.
'Most people who have hay fever in the summer months are allergic to grass pollen but you could be reacting to pollen from summer flowering trees, weeds or crops.
'Also you could be allergic to fungal spores that can be in the air on dry or damp days.'
AVOID GOING OUTSIDE WHEN THE POLLEN COUNT IS HIGH
Experts advise trying to avoid going out when the pollen count is high.
Dr Emberlin told MailOnline: 'On dry warm days grass pollen counts are highest from early to mid morning and from mid to late afternoon.
'This is when most grasses release their pollen. In the middle part of the day convection currents mix the air and dilute concentrations.'
DON'T CUT THE LAWN
Dr Emberlin, said a top tip is to avoid cutting the lawn, or failing that, get someone else to take on the chore for you.
'Although the short grass on lawns will probably not flower and release pollen, the sap from the cut grass will form aerosols containing grass allergens which could trigger your hay fever,' she said.
WEAR SUNGLASSES
'If you have problems with itchy and runny eyes, wear wrap round sunglasses to help keep pollen out of the eyes,' Dr Emberlin said.
'Wash eyes frequently especially after being outdoors, and use anti allergy eye drops to alleviate the symptoms.'
'Alcohol in excess will suppress the immune system and can make symptoms worse,' Dr Emberlin said.
PACK YOUR DIET WITH VITAMIN C
A healthy diet can help ease symptoms, Dr Emberlin told MailOnline.
She said: 'Aim to have a healthy diet with a high intake of vitamins especially C and D as these are thought to be beneficial for hay fever sufferers.
'Avoid drying washing outdoors on high pollen count days. The washing acts as an air filter collecting the pollen which will then be brought indoors.'
AVOID TOO MUCH ALCOHOL
'Alcohol in excess will suppress the immune system and can make symptoms worse,' Dr Emberlin said.
Other notable triggers, include dairy food, which increase mucus secretion.
And air pollution especially from vehicles and cigarette smoke is known to cause irritation to the airways and eyes and make the symptoms worse.
In addition, Dr Emberlin told MailOnline swimming in indoor pools can make symptoms worse because the chlorine in the water can irritate the airways and eyes.
Stress and dehydration can also make symptoms worse, she warned.

She said:'It isn't supposed to be hot but it must have heated up on its own and exploded.
'The pain was horrific. I could feel my skin burning. I thought I was blind.
NutriBullet said they would not comment until it had been inspected.It added: 'We ensure the very highest quality standards are adhered to'
'I could see the skin on my eyelid hanging down. My skin was melting off my face. It was unbearable.'
She said the accident has left her looking like a monster.
NutriBullet said they would not comment until after it had been investigated.
It added: 'We ensure the very highest quality standards are adhered to.'
According to Royal insiders, the Nutribullet is the Duchess of Cambridge's 'secret weapon' for staying in shape.
So it's no surprise that smoothie-maker the NutriBullet has become a must-have device.
The gadget, which pulverises fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds, is known as an 'extractor' rather than a juicer or blender, due to its unique high-powered blade action.
It's this, manufacturers say, which is the key to retaining the nutritional content in your smoothie.

The 25-year-old's Tutti Fruity range - a collection of bath products - launched at midnight on Superdrug's website and was an instant hit with hundreds of products selling overnight
Zoella's latest range - the second drop in her beauty collection - consists of purse-friendly bath products such as Candy Cream lotion, 5, Fresh Fizz Bar, 5, and Foam Sweet Foam, 3.50
Excited fans meet YouTuber Zoella at Superdrug beauty launch
A spokesperson for the high street giant said: 'The first Zoella range was successful but this new collection has taken her to the next level.
'This isnt a one-off range from a beauty blogger, but a truly excellent collection from a brand which is trusted by her teenage fan base.
'Zoe has built up an enormous fan base who trust her implicitly, they know that she wouldnt design a product she wouldnt want to use herself.'
Zoe Sugg aka Zoella is pictured at the launch of her debut beauty collection last year, which was attended by Jamie Oliver (whose children are huge fans of the star)
Zoella became the fastest-selling debut novelist since records began, outselling the likes of JK Rowling and Dan Brown at the end of last year
Seven million subs and 12m hits a month: Meet Zoella
Miss Sugg grew up in Lacock, Wiltshire, the daughter of a beautician mother and a property developer father.
She started her channel in 2009 and it quickly became her full-time job, with more than 12 million hits on her vlogs per month.
Miss Sugg now charges 20,000 a month to advertisers who want to place products alongside her fashion tips.
She has also been signed by Radio 1, is the charity Minds digital ambassador and was selected, along with brother Joe and boyfriend Alfie, to take part in Bob Geldofs re-release of the Band Aid single.
Zoella became the fastest-selling debut novelist since records began with her tome, Girl Online, outselling the likes of JK Rowling and Dan Brown at the end of last year.
Miss Suggs also starred on the BBC's Comic Relief Bake Off special alongside celebrity contestants Gok Wan, Jonathan Ross and Abbey Clancy.
The youngest contestant by some distance said: 'I was genuinely a little bit shocked and very excited when I was asked to take part.
This is by no means Zoella's only success this month. Just a few weeks ago, Australian teen magazine Dolly also opted to place YouTube 'vlogging' superstar Zoella on their cover.

Sunday marked a turning point in the history of post-war Europe  the moment when the euro began its inevitable collapse, and the European project itself started to disintegrate.
The Greek no vote restricts European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and the laughably incompetent European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker to two options, both of them nightmarish.
They can either allow Greece to impose its own terms for staying in the euro and abandon the EU-imposed austerity policies that have destroyed the national economy, or force Greece to abandon the euro and go back to its own currency.
Scroll down for video
Sunday's 'no' vote marked the moment when the euro began its inevitable collapse
Lets examine the first of those two gruesome scenarios, and suppose that President Juncker and the ECB permit Prime Minister Tsipras  now enormously strengthened as a consequence of his bold decision to hold the national referendum  to loosen the national purse strings.
Immediately, Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Cyprus  and all the other southern European states whose economies have been devastated by eurozone membership  would demand equal treatment. They, too, would insist on debt relief and the end of economic austerity.
Chaos
This in turn would cause chaos right across the Continent. In particular, Germany, the economic dynamo of the EU, could never allow the consequent explosion of spending.
German voters are already furious that, thanks to the eurozone, they are expected to finance what they view as the worthless lifestyles of corrupt Greek businessmen and bone idle Greek workers.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is renowned for near magical powers. She is the most powerful politician in Europe today. Yet even she could never convince her voters to pay for sweetheart deals for the rest of Europe.
So lets now examine the second and more likely scenario. What would happen if the Greeks demands for a relaxation of austerity measures were rebuffed by the ECB, and the country was forced into what was, until recently, unthinkable  a return to the drachma, established as the national currency after Greece achieved its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1832?
The rejection by the Greek people of austerity measures demanded by international creditors proves once and for all the hubristic folly of Europes one-size-fits-all single currency
Drone captures thousands celebrating 'no' vote in Athens
The re-emergence of the drachma would take the EU into new and terrifying territory. All Greek banks are bankrupt anyway, and only kept afloat by European support. In the absence of that support, they would immediately collapse.
Greek economic production  already down by 25 per cent since 2010  would fall even further. The Greek unemployment rate, now at a frightening 25.6 per cent, would surge.
Mr Juncker and his fellow commissioners in Brussels would be only human if they half hoped the consequences of leaving the euro would lock Greece in penury for ever.
It would help their cause of European unity if they could hold out Greece as a dreadful example of the punishment awaiting any country that was impertinent enough not to do what it was told by Europe.
In my view, however, there is a more optimistic scenario: that the country would start to recover after a period of chaos. The drachma would depreciate precipitously, making Greece far more competitive than countries still stuck in the eurozone. Tourism, for example, would boom because holidays in Greece would be so much cheaper.
Leaving the euro would certainly bring immense uncertainty to an already chaotic Greece. But at least with its own national bank, Greece could set its own interest rates and make its own spending decisions. No longer under the control of Brussels commissars and foreign bankers, the economy in time would have a fighting chance of flourishing once again.

Crucially, this was the experience of Argentina after its national currency, the peso, sensationally decoupled from the U.S. dollar in 2002.
The economy grew at an amazing annual rate of 9 per cent between 2003 and 2007.
It would, of course, be a total disaster for the European project if Greece, freed from the shackles of the euro, mirrored Argentinas success. Rival European states stuck inside the stagnating eurozone would study the Greek economy at first with disbelief, then amazement and finally with envy. Then, one by one, they would follow the example of Greece and break away from the eurozone.
Perhaps I am being too optimistic. There is no denying that an unpredictable period lies ahead. Indeed, Europe could be about to enter possibly the most dangerous time since the Thirties, when it witnessed the rise of fascism in Germany, Italy and elsewhere.
Already it is being convulsed by some of the same problems: mass unemployment, economic degradation, out-of-touch elites and the consequent rise of extremist political parties, both on the far Left and the far Right.
This is also a very sobering moment for Britain. Europe is our largest market, and the economic consequences for us will be desperate indeed as the eurozone enters a vortex of decline.
It would, of course, have been much worse had Britain joined the euro when it was started  and there is an enormous irony here. The idea of European monetary union, i.e. a single currency, was first seriously discussed at the Rome summit of the EU in 1990, almost 25 years ago.
Margaret Thatcher was then the British Prime Minister, and she spoke out defiantly against French President Mitterrand and German Chancellor Cole as they bulldozed their pet concept through.
Margaret Thatchers act of lonely but heroic defiance towards the proposed single currency led directly to her downfall
Margaret Thatchers act of lonely but heroic defiance led directly to her downfall. Her opposition to the single currency provoked the resignation of Geoffrey Howe from the Cabinet, and then the leadership challenge of Michael Heseltine, forcing her resignation within weeks.
Today, however, Margaret Thatchers last stand looks nothing less than prophetic (and Howe and Heseltines roles appear beneath contempt).
Had other European states listened to her warnings, the Continent would be a very different, less dangerous, more prosperous and much happier place today. Back in the Nineties, Mrs Thatchers enemies, both in Britain and on the Continent, dismissed what she had to say as shrill and bigoted.
In fact, her analysis was compassionate and profound. Unlike almost everybody else, she understood that it was impossible to have a single currency without a single country as well. This is because a single currency requires the same borrowing and spending policies  and therefore an unchallenged political legitimacy  right across the single-currency area.
Tragically, European leaders refused to believe these warnings. They were determined, at whatever human cost, to create a federal Europe and obliterate national boundaries.
This explains their otherwise lunatic decision to impose a single currency across 19 different countries, each with its own history, set of institutions and special economic characteristics.
The British politicians who encouraged this demented project  including Heseltine, Howe, Blair and Kinnock  should hang their heads in shame.
Bullies
They, too, bear their full share of responsibility for an economic and political experiment which has driven tens of millions of people out of work, and destroyed the economies of not just regions, but of entire countries.
The critics of Alexis Tsipras say that he is a deranged Marxist academic. Perhaps. Compared to Juncker or his predecessor Jacques Delors, or even President Mitterrand and Merkel with their obsessive attachment to the euro, he is a model of common sense and sanity.
Marxist or not, his courage stands in a direct line of succession to that of Margaret Thatcher 25 years ago. Like Thatcher, Tsipras has been patriotic and bloody-minded enough to stand up for his own people against the bullies of the European Union.
Terrible risks lie ahead, but he has already achieved something extraordinary. The idea of democracy was invented in Greece 2,500 years ago. Thanks to him, democracy inside the eurozone, snuffed out by the single currency, was reborn in Greece on Sunday.
We in Britain must give Mr Tsipras all the help and support we can as he sculpts a fresh future for his famous and wonderful country  and, let us all hope and pray, saves the continent of Europe in the process.

The USA, China and Russia all want to develop missiles that can travel at 4,000mph (stock image)
An arms race is speeding up between three of the world's most powerful countries, as each looks to develop missiles and fighter jets that travel more than five times the speed of sound.
Military scientists in the United States, China and Russia are independently attempting to build fighter aircraft and missiles that can travel at 4,000mph as part of a new type of hypersonic weapon.
While China and Russia want to invent missiles that are able to outsmart US ballistic defence systems, American researchers want the technology to be able to hit 'time sensitive' targets that can hit fast-moving objects with greater accuracy.
Should they be successful, the US Air Force is expected to seek the help of NASA to prepare pilots for travelling at Mach 5 speeds.
Scientists at the US laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, are within reach of creating weapons able to travelat Mach 5, with on official describing the development as 'game-changing technology', Michael Evans of The Times reported.
Researches in the US and Russia have carried out test flights of the new 'game-changing technology'
They have carried out four test flights of the X-51 WaveRider, its hypersonic vehicle, with one flying more than 230 nautical miles at 4,000mph, and the Russian tested their version, Yu-71, in February unsuccessfully.
On Thursday the deputy US defence chief said Russia was 'playing with fire' with its nuclear armament programme, and the country was determined to prevent it from gaining a significant military advantage.

And one in ten dont bother with a honeymoon at all, according to the survey by LateRooms.com.
Almost half of the 2,000 couples surveyed either stayed in the UK or ventured no further than the Continent for their break.
Almost half of the 2,000 couples surveyed either stayed in the UK or ventured no further than the Continent for their break
One in five said the pressures of work meant they didnt have time to go away for two weeks.
Meanwhile, 30 per cent said the fact they had to pay for their wedding  or contribute heavily to the cost  meant they couldnt afford an extravagant trip.
Almost half of UK newlyweds (49%) now either stay in the UK or venture no further than Europe for their post-marital mini-moon, the LateRooms.com study revealed.
By contrast, in 2005 the top honeymoon destinations for Britons were Hawaii, Tahiti, Fiji, St Lucia, Mexico, Jamaica and Anguilla.
LateRooms.com spokeswoman Andrea Tarpey said: With newlyweds footing more of the bill for their big day than ever before, and having greater demands on their time at work, were seeing couples embrace the mini-moon and taking shorter, less costly getaways closer to home.
With such a fantastic range of destinations on our doorstep, 32% of couples choose to head to Europe, whilst a growing number (17%) opt to stay in the UK to enjoy their first week as Mr and Mrs.
'Growing in popularity, some 20% will opt for an American mini-moon.
We understand the pressures of modern couples striving to achieve the perfect wedding day as well as the perfect honeymoon, which is why we launched weddingguestrooms.com to help brides and grooms provide a personalised site with the very best accommodation options for their guests.

	Ty Rees saves choking sister Star Tyack after watching St John Ambulance’s Chokeables advert

	Confronted by a choking toddler, other children might have panicked. But 12-year-old Ty Rees, from Tuffley in Gloucester, saved his little sister’s life after he remembered watching a first aid advert.

Ty called for his mother and her boyfriend Kevin Blackburn, who gave Star another back slap. Three 5p coins shot out of her mouth.
Miss Tyack, 38, of Tuffley, Gloucester, said: 'Ty was absolutely fantastic. He's a complete hero. He was so quick and so calm.
Ty remembered a recent advert (pictured) on how to stop a baby choking - and saved his little sister's life
Star Tyack (pictured with Ty) had swallowed some 5p coins, leaving her unable to breathe or make a sound
'In instances like this every second counts and what Ty did saved his sister's life.'
The ordeal happened on Tuesday after Star took the coins from her brother's rucksack.
Miss Tyack added: 'He literally screamed for help. I've never heard anything like it  my boyfriend and I were there in seconds but the fact he had already dislodged the coins when we got there was amazing.
'In the time we were getting there he did exactly what he should have  he started hitting her back. Then she cried. He saved her life.'
Following the ordeal Marie and Kev, 27, took Star to hospital to get her checked over, but she was fine and scans showed she had swallowed no more foreign objects.
The offending 5p coins which Star choked on
Miss Tyack said she made Ty watch the St John Ambulance 'Chokeables' video after his sister began walking, adding: 'When I showed it to him he said, 'I'm never going to be on my own with Star, so I don't need it'.
'But I told him he needed to watch it in case. He said that as soon as he saw Star choking the video just started playing in his head and he knew exactly what to do.
'He was amazingly brave and I just want to thank St John Ambulance for making the film that showed him how to save my little girl's life.'
Jim Jones, a training manager for St John Ambulance, said: 'Our video campaign was aimed at showing people what to do if a baby aged under 12 months was choking.
'But, while the techniques are different for older children and adults, the principles of how to save someone's life in that situation are similar.
'In an emergency, it is better to do something than do nothing and Ty delivered first aid when it mattered most.
'Incidents like this show why it is absolutely vital that every child learns the skills to save lives and St John Ambulance is campaigning hard to get first aid taught in every school.'

	Former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond have been blocked from immediately appearing on a rival motoring show on ITV by their former BBC contracts.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

A TV source told the Daily Mirror: 'Basically they could make a show for ITV, but not one about cars. A clause stops them leaving and making a rival.
'It means Netflix or Amazon are favourites to sign up the team. There is a feeling that if they wait two years it gives Chris Evans a chance to steal a march on them and get his new Top Gear show up and running, which means he would be settled in by then.
'It's a difficult decision but they hope to make up their minds soon after a number of meetings. ITV have made them a great offer.'
The trio met with senior ITV official Peter Fincham in London along with former Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman to discuss the contract issue.
The BBC has appointed Chris Evans, left, to replace Jeremy Clarkson, right, as Top Gear's main presenter
The final episode of Top Gear featuring Clarkson, May and Hammond had almost six million viewers
The BBC ditched Clarkson following an incident in March involving a Top Gear producer.
However, the BBC could be left extremely embarrassed by their decision to ditch Clarkson.
The last episode, which featured two previously un-broadcast films was watched by 5.8 million people, with many more tuning in later on BBC iPlayer.
The long-running TV show has also been nominated for best entertainment show at the 2015 TV Choice Awards, along with Ant and Dec, ITV 2's Celebrity Juice and The Graham Norton Show.
TV Choice and Total TV Guide's editor-in-chief Jon Peake said: 'Top Gear is a big hit with our readers. Ant and Dec are also very popular and can do no wrong with our readers absolutely adoring them, so coming head-to-head with Ant and Dec could mean it's a fight to the death.'
Lenny Henry will host the TV Choice Awards, which take place at the London Hilton Park Lane hotel on September 7.

He told the audience: Let me tell you about my trouble with girls... three things happen when they are in the lab... You fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticise them, they cry.
Sir Tim, who won a Nobel Prize in 2001, later said his comments were light-hearted. But he quit his honorary professorship at University College London after allegedly being told to resign or be sacked, leading him to feel he had been hung out to dry.
Resigned: Sir Tim Hunt has now quit his professorship at University College London
A leaked European Commission source backed up his account of the speech, saying it was warm and funny and that he said now seriously after his controversial comments to show they were intended as a joke. But Mrs St Louis, who lectures at City University in London, said yesterday: Whatever he said after now seriously, its still outrageous. He talks about women as girls... you make them cry, they fall in love with you, is he seriously saying that? Is that his own personal story? Why is he calling them girls? And then he goes on to advocate single-sex laboratories. Now seriously, is he thinking there should be single-sex laboratories?
On his return to the UK, Sir Tim resigned from roles at UCL, the Royal Society and the European Research Council. His wife said she was told by a senior UCL figure understood to be Dean of Life Sciences Geraint Rees  that he should resign or be sacked.
But yesterday a UCL source denied this version of events. They said there was little chance of Sir Tim being given his honorary professorship back, adding: I dont think reinstatements on the agenda and I dont think Sir Tim wants it.
Rather than his reinstatement, the [universitys governing council] is likely to discuss the issues about women in science and the coverage in the media, and how its been handled by UCL management. But what a mess it all is.

She adds: 'For the last year and a half, Ive been told that Im paranoid, Im a psycho, Im nuts, my insecurities will kill me one day.'
Ms Murphy says she was attacked because she confronted her former partner about an affair, after the other woman contacted her in November admitting she was pregnant.
Ms Murphy was pregnant herself at the time and says she went into labour early as a result of the stress, after which her world 'turned upside down'.
Ms Murphy chokes back tears as she describes how her ex-boyfriend and the father of her children punched her in the face after she confronted him about cheating on her
'He was the love of my life,' Ms Murphy says of their three-year relationship, adding that the recent attack was 'not the first time'
The blonde mother, whose children, a boy and a girl, are both under the age of three, explains that it took until now to realise the violence she claims she was enduring was unacceptable.
'I finally realised that no, this is not acceptable,' she says. 'No man has the right to put his hand on a woman. No matter how big, how small, no matter where youre from.
'It is not right to raise a hand to a woman and its only now that Ive realised that.
'Even once is unacceptable, but to be made to feel that it is acceptable is even worse. To be made to feel that youre paranoid or insecure, thats mental torture, and no man should do that to any woman.'
Ms Murphy says she has since left the relationship and describes herself as single mother.
Ms Murphy (pictured) says she thought 'long and hard' before posting the video but hopes it will 'inspire' other women around the world to realize that 'violence is not the answer'
Ms Murphy, pictured in happier times, has since left the relationship and describes herself as single mother
'Unfortunately, when they ask where their daddy is, hes not going to be around, hes not going to be here for them anymore,' she says in between sobs. 'Our lives are completely torn apart.
'And theyre going to know that their daddy hit their mummy, and thats not something that children should see at all.'
She concludes: 'So if anyone out there has gone through something similar to what Ive gone through, you need to find the courage and get away from anything thats an unhealthy as violence.
'Go to your friends and family, people who love you and care about you.'

Yesterdays programme was a valedictory affair. Much of it consisted of presenter Nick Ferrari interviewing Mr Clegg but there were a couple of contributions from callers, plus a clip from Ukips Nigel Farage (good grief, this column feels cobwebbed). Old Farage, who is in fact barely 51, felt rather sorry for Mr Clegg and suspected he would have been cheerful not to have retained his Sheffield Hallam constituency. Mr Clegg retorted: There speaks a man who didnt win his seat.
Mr Clegg had to settle a 50 wager with presenter Ferrari (they had bet on the election result, Mr Clegg insisting he would retain his position). He handed over some cash yesterday but it was not clear if that had entirely cleared the debt.
The Lib Dem leadership had realised about ten days before the election that voters were fleeing to the Tories. Yet no one in the Clegg camp had foreseen the size of the defeat. I was pretty blindsided by the exit poll, said Mr Clegg.
Call Clegg: The former Deputy Prime Minister made an appearance on radio with Nick ferrari, left, again this week on LBC where he used to answer questions every week on the show
Nick Clegg insists he has not destroyed his party
His words were peppered by checks and delay mechanisms, kindas and sort ofs and Californian uplifts. Sentences trailed away, left unfinished. Were these signs that he remains disorientated by the loss of high office? He could not remember whom he had first telephoned after the exit poll. And no, he had not reached for a strong drink. I dont sort of go for the bottle at moments like that.
For all this aw-shucks mateyness, the maddening Clegg, the Clegg who so often seemed hypocritical, was not far below the surface. He hoped the Tories would not govern to suit their own party advantage  this from a man who frequently blocked Whitehall reforms to suit the Lib Dems.
I miss taking decisions, said the ex-deputy PM who was a byword for inertia. In reference to child poverty targets, he said it is not acceptable to suddenly change the goalposts to suit yourself. This same Clegg tried to engineer electoral reform for personal advantage and then, in a tantrum, stopped the Tories reducing the number of seats and making constituencies fairer. Oh well.
He said he did not want to sound funereal and he was able to claim  as he always will be  that he helped to create a surprisingly stable government at a time of economic peril.
There was a human interest in this interview. It told us something about the personality of Mr Clegg, proud but tinged by sourness. Finally, did he still play tennis with David Cameron? No! he snapped, the answer coming as fast as an Andy Murray return of service.

Brig Ridge, who left the 'mundanity' of a civilian law career to join the Army, said the opportunities for women were now far wider than when she joined.
'Certainly, when I did my infantry attachment, I was the only female in the battalion,' she said of her time with the Queen's Lancashire Regiment in Berlin in 1992.
'That's not now the case. Women are now in a wide range of roles.'
Brig Ridge, who said she expected other senior female officers to progress to the general ranks, added: 'I think it shows that women can progress in the Army.
'In part this stems from the changes made when the Women's Royal Army Corps was dissolved.'
That change took place in 1992 and Brig Ridge said 'it takes about 20 years to make a career at this level and I'm expecting to start seeing women starting to come through now'.
Brig Ridge was working in land and property law before joining the Army.
Earlier the Army appointed Brigadier Sharon Nesmith, right, as commanding officer of a brigade of 5,000 front line troops,, the first time a woman has been put in charge of such a large number of front line soldiers
'I had just been offered a partnership,' she said. 'It suddenly came home to me that would be my next 30 years of working life.
'I just wanted do something before the mundanity of everyday life.'
She signed up for four years and thought 'let's see how it goes', but said it was 'never my aim' to rise through the ranks.
'I didn't join Army Legal Services to make major general. I joined to do something that I wanted to do and was interesting.'
Brig Ridge, who credits her adolescent son for keeping her grounded, said she was 'exceptionally lucky' that her lieutenant colonel husband has been 'hugely supportive of my work'.
He took on 'much of the responsibility of managing family and home life, while also juggling his own career'.
'There have been occasions when he has been posted away, we have done long periods of weekend commuting and he has done tours in the Balkans and Afghanistan. But largely it has worked so well because he has been on-side.'
The DGALS is responsible for the whole of Army Legal Services which provides legal support to the service in barracks, on training and on operations.
General Sir Nicholas Carter, the Chief of the General Staff, said: 'I am very pleased for Sue; she is a talented and committed officer who is widely respected throughout the Army.'
This follows the appointment of married mother-of-two Brigadier Sharon Nesmith to command a brigade of 5,000 frontline soldiers.

	Paul McCartney's daughter, 43, has staggering form as the designer-clad shadow to every woman of the moment from Kate Moss 20 years ago to Cara Delevingne.

However, the practice of gifting outfits to close friends can result in extremely mutually-agreeable publicity, such as when Amal wore another bespoke Stella McCartney outfit during her Venice wedding celebrations last year.
The all-white ensemble of wide-legged trousers, floppy hat, top and bag made headlines.

And there are times, such as at the 2014 Met Ball in New York, when the association is evidently commercial. Stella took a table at the event  costing 16,000 a plate  and her invited guests, including Rihanna, Reese Witherspoon and Cara Delevingne, acted as ambassadors for her fashion house.
Cara, nice shy girl that she is, posted an Instagram picture of her perfect rear in a pair of rather exclusive skin-tight white pants which had been monogrammed with her name by Stella.
Maccas daughter is a Met Ball aficionado. In previous years, shes invited the likes of actresses Cameron Diaz, Liv Tyler and Salma Hayek to the fundraiser. All turned up in her outfits.
Left -Shimmering in a Stella McCartney gown (31,000), actress CameronDiaz cuddles up to a surprisingly chic Stella at the Met Ball in 2012. Right -Model Amber Valetta in a 2,700 burnt orange Stella McCartneyfrock, at the 2012 British Fashion Awards. Stella hadwon designer of the year
In a role reversal, Stella dresses as a rock star and puts Madonna in a ladylike cream coat (1,220) at the VH1 Fashion awards in 1999
Close friend Gwyneth Paltrow also attended (in guess what?) in 2011. The actress went through a phase of wearing a lot of Stella McCartney when she was living in Belsize Park with Chris Martin.
For several years she and Stella hung out in London with Madonna. Theyd work out in Madonnas home gym with trainer Tracey Anderson every day and Stella even designed the singers stage costumes for a 2004 tour.
But the trio fell out over Madonnas parsimonious insistence that Gwyneth and Stella should pay to use her gym. The Material Girl hasnt been seen in a Stella McCartney dress since.
Another old friend is Kate Moss, who is a face of the Stella McCartney brand and star of its current advertising campaign.
Left -Baywatch hottie Pamela Anderson (in a 1,650 Stella McCartney suit) and the designer at the British Fashion Awards in 2003. Right -Gwyneth Paltrow must have been talked into this Stella McCartney jacket (1,025) and skirt (1,374) at the 2001 VH1 Fashion Awards
Stella, daughter of a Beatle, and Liv Tyler, daughter of Aerosmiths singer, in T-shirts (155) at the Met Gala in 1999
As you might expect, shes quite often seen wearing Stella McCartney clothes  such as the Illusion bodysculpting dress which she wore in 2012.
Theres another designer with a musical past whos never been a friend: Victoria Beckham. In fact, theres talk of a bitchy rivalry.
Not that Stella will care too much  shes well known for a take-no-prisoners briskness in personal dealings.
And of course, her privileged status as the daughter of a Beatle also gave her the ability to network in the celebrity milieu like an absolute pro.

	Draped in state's striped flag, their corpses were carried overhead by weeping relatives ahead of a mass funeral at Kuwait City's Grand Mosque.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>The health ministry said that 40 wounded are still in hospital and the rest have been discharged.
Two of the dead were Iranian, the Shiite-dominated Islamic republic's foreign ministry said.
Friday's attack targeted Al-Imam Al-Sadeq mosque in Kuwait City during Friday noon prayers.
Condolences were being accepted for three days from Saturday at the Grand Mosque, the largest place of worship for Sunni Muslims, in a show of solidarity.
Kuwaiti health officials confirmed that 40 people are still being treated in hospital following the attack
Kuwait declared today a day of mourning to commemorate those murdered by the terror attack
The interior ministry said it has arrested the owner of the car the bomber used to go to the mosque, and that the driver was now being sought.
The vehicle's owner gave it to someone who drove the suicide bomber to the mosque, a ministry statement said.
The ministry said an unspecified number of suspects were held for questioning in connection with the attack that shook the small Gulf state.
No details were provided.
ISIS claimed responsibility for Friday's atrocity which was the worst ever terrorist attack in the country
Thousands of people followed the funeral cortege as the victims were brought to their final resting places
Kuwaiti authorities said they have made several arrests following the deadly terror attack
The government briefed MPs in a joint meeting about measures it has taken after the bombing, Sheikh Mohammad told reporters.
Kuwait's emir, the government, parliament and political groups and clerics have all said the attack aimed to stir up sectarian strife in the emirate.
Sunni religious and political groups were quick to condemn the attack which was claimed by ISIS, a radical Sunni group which considers Shiites to be heretics.
Shiites form a third of Kuwait's 1.3 million native population.
A mass funeral was planned for the victims of the Kuwaiti suicide bombing that killed 27 people on Friday
The bodies of some of those killed in the blast were piled into vehicles by mourning relatives on Saturday
Draped in the state's striped flag, the men's corpses were lifted on stretchers by groups of mourners
The cabinet announced after an emergency meeting on Friday that all security agencies and police had been placed on alert to confront what it called 'black terror'.
Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister Yacoub al-Sane said additional security measures will be taken around mosques and places of worship.
Kuwait declared Saturday to be a day of mourning.
The emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who visited the site immediately after the bombing, said the 'criminal attack is a desperate and evil attempt targeting Kuwait's national unity'.
Members of the parliament joined mourners as they made their way to the cemetery in the west of the city
Most of the victims were buried in a cemetery in the west of Kuwait city following a funeral service today
Countries and organisations including the United Nations and the United States deplored the bombing.
Eight Islamist, liberal and Shiite political groups condemned the attack in a joint statement and called on the government to confront extremists.
National oil conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC) said on Saturday it had raised security at oil facilities to maximum level.
Oil is Kuwait's main source of income, accounting for around 90 per cent of public revenues.
The OPEC member says it sits on around 10 percent of global reserves and pumps around 2.8 million barrels of oil per day.
The mass funeral comes as security sources say numerous arrests have been made in connection with the attack
A weeping man embraced another mourner as they carried the bodies into trucks on Saturday after the violent attack
Today a Kuwaiti security source said a number of people had been arrested in connection with the bombing, the worst in the state for years.
'Numerous arrests of people suspected of having ties with the suicide bomber have been made,' they told Reuters on Saturday.Local newspaper al-Qabas reported the number as three.
Officials previously claimed the attack had been intended to divide Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims across the state, with ISIS a radical strand of Sunni Islam.
Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed al Khaled al Sabah has described the interference as an 'evil hand in our homeland's security.'
Medics and security forces gather inside the Imam Sadiq Mosque attempt to secure the scene following the devastating blast on Friday
Rescue workers carry out one seriously injured man from the mosque attack, where as many as 27 worshipers were killed
Scores of survivors wandered the streets yesterday after the blast, their robes drenched in the blood of those killed and injured in the attack.
Witnesses described the young attacker as having been stood among around 2,000 worshippers before detonating the bomb.
Elsewhere on Friday two Tunisian gunmen slaughtered dozens of holidaymakers on a beach in Sousse.
The men opened fire on tourists in a horrifying attack which killed 15 Britons.
In France a man was decapitated and his head covered in Arabic inscriptions before being impaled on a spike near Grenoble.
Speculation has arisen over whether the three incidents were signs of a lengthy spate of violence launched by ISIS during the month of Ramadan.
Hundreds were injured in the blast which tore through the mosque as men observed Friday prayers

	BBC rewriting Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons is bonkers, TOM UTLEY writes

In the 1930 book, the child heroine was called Titty. In the cleaned-up version made by BBC Films, shes called Tatty.
Now, we can only guess what persuaded the screenplay writers or the Corporations executives to make the change. Did they seriously believe that Titty was too obscene a word to broadcast to an audience of youngsters? Surely not.
More likely, given what we know about the BBC, they thought it might be interpreted as belittling women  and would thereby upset feminists of the sort who spend their lives looking for reasons to be offended.
Another possibility, of course, is that they feared it would prompt childish snickering, which might distract young viewers attention from Ransomes wholesome tale of the outdoor life and derring-do.
But whatever the reason, I was interested to read that the BBC had made the same decision to change Tittys name before. This was for its 1963 television adaptation of Swallows And Amazons  although on that occasion it called her Kitty instead. As it happens, Tatty seems a more academically respectable choice than Kitty, since Ransome apparently based his character on a girl he knew, Mavis Altounyan, who took her nickname Titty from the childrens story, Titty Mouse And Tatty Mouse.
The BBC revealed their plans this week to rename one of the Walker siblings in Swallows And Amazons for its forthcoming adaptation of Arthur Ransomes classic adventure story
But, really, why on earth change the name at all? Back in 1963, the decision may have been just about understandable  at a pinch.
After all, this was two years before the theatre critic Kenneth Tynan earned the dubious (and disputed) distinction of becoming the first person to utter the F-word on TV. And all hell broke loose when he did.
But today? What conceivable point can there be in shielding children from such an innocent little word as Titty, in an age when they are bombarded with genuine filth every day of their lives?
Indeed, it sometimes seems that the F-word, in its various formations, is the only verb, noun or adjective in the vocabulary of many television dramatists, chefs or chat-show hosts and interviewees  while catch-up TV has made the 9pm watershed even less of a safeguard than ever.
Meanwhile, the internet has given todays Swallows And Amazons generation ready access to hardcore porn at its vilest  words and images that belittle, insult and objectify women a thousand times more grievously than any imaginary offence Ransome may have given to the sisterhood.
Yet here is Auntie Beeb  herself the purveyor of her fair share of F-words and X-rated scenes  pursing her lips over the possibility that youngsters may draw some connection between young Miss Walkers nickname and the female breast.
Well, there was always that risk. But then if Auntie is seriously worried that sniggering schoolboys may see sexual references where they are unintended, why doesnt she go the whole hog?
In this spirit of tit for tat, she should perhaps take her blue pencil to Countryfile, instructing its presenters to talk about blue tats, coal tats and great tats.
And what about changing the name of Dick, hero of Enid Blytons Famous Five, to something less likely to raise a puerile chuckle?
Come to that, I notice that Tittys brother remains Roger in the Corporations latest adaptation. Scope for a double-entendre there, surely. As for the former Shadow Chancellor, the BBC could always rename him Ed Bills. (And dont lets even mention P.G. Wodehouses Stiffy Pinker  let alone Ian Flemings Pussy Galore.)
Of course, this was not the first occasion this week when Auntie attracted ridicule for getting her knickers in a twist over a rude-sounding word.
A couple of days before the Titty debate broke out, BBC Breakfast presenter Louise Minchin made a similar fool of herself  insulting her guest into the bargain  when she apologised on air for Alan Titchmarshs use of the words bastard trenching.
As seasoned gardeners will know, this is the traditional term to describe digging a trench to the depth of two spades, to increase soil drainage and aeration.
But to Minchin (or perhaps her bosses, hissing into her earpiece) it was a disgraceful profanity.
We just have to apologise, she said at the end of the interview, for some of the language used in the last couple of minutes.
Affectionate
Poor Titchmarsh (Tatchmarsh) was clearly mortified. Oh no, no, no, no, its a term in a gardening book, he said. I shant repeat it, but its not offensive at all'
Poor Titchmarsh (Tatchmarsh) was clearly mortified. Oh no, no, no, no, its a term in a gardening book, he said. I shant repeat it, but its not offensive at all.
As it happens, people in my trade often use the term bastard measure to describe the width of a line of type when it differs from that of the newspapers standard column. You see it, for example, when type snakes its way round a photograph.
Similarly, I see from the dictionary that the word has many other technical uses, none of them in the least bit pejorative. Bricklayers speak of bastard pointing, botanists of bastard mahogany, toadflax and indigo, while a grey sea turtle is known to marine biologists as the bastard Ridley.
There is surely a simple rule, here, which seems to have escaped the BBC: a word is offensive only when its used in an offensive sense. Thus, bastard is a very rude word when its used to describe someone we dont like  and even more so, when applied deliberately to a person whose parents are unmarried.
In the same way, Titty would indeed be derogatory and offensive if it were applied maliciously to a large-breasted woman.
As an affectionate nickname for a young girl, derived from the name of a mouse in a childrens story, it is utterly inoffensive.
So when BBC executives apologise for Alan Titchmarshs correct use of a gardening term, or change the name of a much-loved character in Swallows And Amazons, theyre not making a stand for decency or the rights of women.
Theyre just proving that, like me, they have dirty minds.
Could we start thinking of ways to protect children from the myriad modern influences that genuinely harm them  and stop fussing about nothing?

A flagship free school in a deprived area has outperformed leading private rivals in the toughest A-level subjects.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said the sixth form college  which sent five pupils to Oxbridge  showed that rigorous academic education needn't and shouldn't be the preserve of the rich or lucky.
The London Academy of Excellence in Stratford, East London, had more pupils score highly in two or more difficult A-levels  such as maths, biology, chemistry and history  than Roedean, Marlborough College and Wellington College, which all charge more than 30,000 a year.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan (pictured) said the sixth form college  which sent five pupils to Oxbridge  showed that rigorous academic education needn't and shouldn't be the preserve of the rich or lucky
Nicky Morgan shares plan to improve 3,500 schools in England
In the schools first A-levels last summer, 39 per cent of pupils achieved two As and a B including at least two tough subjects while Wellington College in Berkshire and Roedean in Brighton had 38 per cent and Wiltshires Marlborough College had 30 per cent.
Seventy-two students from The London Academy, which is in the borough of Newham, went to top universities  compared with 46 in the rest of the boroughs schools combined.
Mrs Morgan said: With teachers and parents in the driving seats, free schools are leading the way in inspiring children from disadvantaged areas to break down barriers and achieve their full potential.
We are opening 500 more free schools this Parliament, underlining our commitment to giving children from all walks of life access to a world-class education.
About 70 per cent of pupils at the free school are from ethnic minorities, mainly Bengali and Pakistani. Languages spoken include Bengali, Urdu and Arabic
About 70 per cent of pupils at the free school are from ethnic minorities, mainly Bengali and Pakistani. Languages spoken include Bengali, Urdu and Arabic.
About 30 per cent of pupils are eligible for free school meals. The school, which opened in 2012, was the brainchild of Richard Cairns, headmaster of Brighton College, and is supported by seven independent schools including Eton College, Caterham and Highgate.
Mr Cairns said he had the idea when talking to pupils at Kingsford Community School in Newham, a comprehensive where he is a governor, and sporty children said they wanted to join a football academy.
He said: I thought how wrong it was that those with sporting aspirations had a focus for their ambitions but there was no academy of excellence for those with academic aspirations.

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs revealed last night it had been forced to divert 45million of taxpayers' cash to fix the call centre chaos, which was branded 'woeful' and 'unacceptable' by tax experts. This will pay for 3,000 extra staff, who have been hastily recruited in the past month.
At peak times  including the end of the tax year in March  the taxman missed a third of calls. In January alone, more than a million callers hung up after being forced to wait on the line, which costs up to 40p a minute from mobiles.
Even if calls were answered, some people had to wait 40 minutes to speak to an adviser, experts said last night.
Paul Aplin, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said: 'Telephone response times have been getting steadily worse and have reached totally unacceptable levels.
'It took me 40 minutes to get through earlier this week. It's good that HMRC has acknowledged the scale of the problem and that it has allocated 3,000 extra people to the task.
'But it's essential that this resource remains in place long-term. Until we see things improve, customers should look to use the online services instead wherever possible.'
'Woeful': Even if calls were answered, some people had to wait 40 minutes to speak to an adviser, experts said last night (file photo)
Tax expert George Bull, at Baker Tilly, added: 'Anyone who has tried to get through to the HMRC helpline in recent months will be relieved to hear that the department is taking steps to improve its woeful record on call handling.
'However, the problem is not just about getting through, it's also about the quality of the service that's provided. Simply getting more people to man the phones will not necessarily solve this problem.'
Robin Williamson, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: 'These figures will come as no surprise to the many people who have experienced their telephone performance in recent years.
'The phone lines are the only way you can contact HMRC after they closed most of their offices and with a digital system which is still in development. They remain a lifeline if you need to sort out your tax affairs, so the telephone system has to work.
'Waiting times are not uncommonly over half an hour. This can be very expensive for those on pay-as-you-go, which is typically people on lower incomes.' The '03000' number to call the taxman is typically 9p a minute from landlines and between 8p and 40p a minute from mobiles, unless the user has a free calls package, according to Ofcom estimates.
Between April 2014 and March this year, 64.7million calls were made to HMRC, of which 72 per cent (46.8million) were successfully answered. This fell short of the revenue body's target of 80 per cent.
The 45million allocation will come from the current spending budget and is not additional revenue from the Treasury, HMRC said.
Chief executive Lin Homer said: 'Despite our best efforts, our call performance hasn't been up to scratch and we apologise to all those customers who have struggled to get through to us.'
She added that staff numbers had been boosted from 15,000 to 18,000, and another 2,000 workers temporarily drafted in from other roles to deal with the crisis.
Patrick Stevens, at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: 'The fact almost 18million taxpayers could not get through to HMRC last year is alarming.
'HMRC must prioritise customer service so taxpayers aren't disadvantaged by not being able to get through to an adviser.
'We have previously voiced concern that the closure of walk-in inquiry centres would increase the strain on HMRC's call centres.'

A six-year-old girl has been killed by a tractor her father was driving during a weekend break at their holiday home.
Teal David was at her family's house in Aberdaron, north Wales, when she was struck by the vehicle as it towed a trailer.
Her father, San Francisco-born vet Evan David, is understood to have been driving the tractor when the accident occurred on a quiet, country lane at around 8.30am today.
Tragic: A seven-year-old girl has died after an accident involving a tractor her father was driving on a lane near their holiday home in Whistling Sands beach in Aberdaron (above)
Mr David, a father-of-three, is runs a veterinary practice in Thame, Oxon. He and his family, who live in Henley-on-Thames, are understood to have been enjoying a break at their Welsh holiday home.
This morning North Wales Police confirmed an incident had occurred shortly before 8.40am on an unmarked lane.
'Officers were called at 8.38am today, Saturday 27th June, to a report of a collision involving a red tractor on an unclassified road in Aberdaron, which resulted in a child suffering fatal injuries,' a statement released by the force said.

	Farmers in Giverny, about 50 miles north east of Paris feared that Claude Monet's water garden, subject of many of his greatest works, pictured, would infect the water supply and kill their cows.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Claude Monet, pictured, was an accomplished gardener, but when he bought a new house near Paris in 1883 local farmers were suspicious
It is the lily pond that has inspired some of the greatest works of French art.
But Claude Monets legacy could have been very different had his neighbours had their way.
In 1893, farmers and councillors wrote to Giverny town hall objecting to the painters plans to extend his garden and create the lily pond.
They repeatedly tried to block his scheme because they feared his exotic plants would poison the water supply and kill their cows.
Had they won, Monets water lily series  which includes the Agapanthus Triptych of 19161919  would never have been painted.
He was eventually given permission however to divert the River Epte to create his pond.
The original council documents will be featured at the Royal Academys latest Monet exhibition, Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse.
After Monet moved to Giverny  50 miles north-west of Paris  in 1883, he bought land on the other side of a railway line that bordered his house. On this land, he planned to create a water garden by diverting the Epte, which is a tributary of the River Seine.
But according to the exhibitions co-curator Ann Dumas, who unearthed the documents, the farmers were suspicious of Monet.
She said: He kept himself to himself so they saw him as an outsider. When they got wind that he wanted to make a water garden they complained.

And a project to promote safe and responsible use of Facebook in Laos, south-east Asia, cost 970.
Humanitarian groups last night said it was important overseas aid spending was concentrated on alleviating poverty.
Diane Sheard, director of the ONE Campaign founded by U2 singer Bono, said: By law, UK aid must help to reduce global poverty. If money is being used to fund schemes that dont meet this goal, then it shouldnt be counted as aid.
Big bite budget:3,104.09 was spent on English lessons for young football players in Urugay, hoping to follow the nation's biting hero Luis Suarez
Shakespeare in love: The FCO spent 5,000 last year on Hamlet education workshops in Ecuador andgave 2,042-worth of free tickets to children for a Hamlet production in Haiti
The reports of Foreign Office aid spending raise legitimate questions.
More than 13,000 was budgeted for a Q&amp;A game show to be shown on Ethiopian television with a UK and Ethiopia theme. A further 5,000 was spent in the African country on a 10k run.
Hundreds of leaflets were printed in Russian and Romanian  at a cost of 2,300  to promote the EU in Moldova.
HEY BIG SPENDER: HOW FOREIGN OFFICE USED YOUR TAXES
Here are just some of the projects on which the Foreign Office spent tax payers' money from their 2013/14 budget.
3,400 was spent on finding female mates for the endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish, in Madagascar.
3,104.09 was spent on Englishlessonsfor youngfootball players inUruguay.
13,888 spent on a Q&amp;A game show on National Televisionin Ethiopia.
51,564 giving Serbians work experience in the UK.
5,000 last year on Hamlet education workshops in Ecuador, South America.
2,042-worth of free tickets given to children for a Hamlet production in Haiti.
And a scheme to find female mates for endangered Mangarahara cichlid fish in Madagascar cost 3,400.
Only three of the species, known as gorgeously ugly, were thought to exist in the world in 2013 and all were male.
In Bolivia 13,500 was budgeted for measuring the carbon footprint of the Dakar off-road car rally.
Last night Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers Alliance, said: Taxpayers will be outraged at these damning revelations. It is totally inappropriate to spend taxpayers cash on pointless projects and propaganda.
Foreign aid is supposed to help the worlds poorest, not subsidise game shows. Until the Foreign Office can prove value for money for these projects, and theyll struggle, this spending should stop.
The Foreign Office last year spent 343million on overseas aid, while the majority of the UKs 12billion annual aid budget is distributed by the Department for International Development. In March the Government passed a bill to enshrine in law its commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of the countrys annual income on aid.
But it has failed to commit to its Nato obligation to spend 2 per cent of its GDP of defence.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: The Foreign Secretary has ordered a review so that we can be sure that every last penny of the FCOs aid spending around the world is effective and represents value for money. Building closer relationships with growing economies is important.
The vast majority of aid spending promotes UK prosperity and broader stability but there will be a crackdown on projects that cannot show taxpayers cash is being spent wisely.
The Department for International Development said that it would not be launching a review into its own projects in light of the Foreign Office spending.

	British households are overpaying for their energy by around £1.2 billion a year and are failing to switch to get the best deals, the Competition and Markets Authority watchdog said today.
      </Description>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <MainBody>Share
It is argued that this would create more competition and drive down bills.
The investigation also outlined plans to encourage customers to switch, but stopped short of recommending a break-up of the energy giants, saying competition in wholesale markets was working well.
In recent days there have been rumours that the CMA will stop short of this in favour of more modest efforts to try to encourage families to shop around for a cheaper deal.
Consumer groups and charities were furious that wholesale energy prices had fallen by more than 20 per cent in a year yet the firms made only tiny cuts in tariffs on standard variable rates.
Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has written to the energy firms demanding they reduce prices
Anger intensified when Britain's second biggest energy firm, SSE, recently revealed that its profits from energy supply rose by almost 50 per cent, up from 122.5 million to 368.7 million over the past year.
The industry regulator Ofgem estimates that the average profit margin energy firms are making per household has risen to an all-time high of 120, which is up by 32 per cent in a year.
Before the General Election power company bosses said that they had been reluctant to cut bills because they feared a Labour victory. They argued that Labour's promise of an 18-month price freeze meant that if they reduced tariffs too much they would be forced to keep them at the new low level.
However, this allowed them to keep prices artificially high, so boosting profits.
Labour's drubbing in the polls has removed any excuse the firms have for keeping tariffs at the current high levels, yet they have made no further cuts.
Energy Secretary Amber Rudd has since written to the energy firms demanding they reduce prices. However, the industry continues to refuse to help struggling customers.
Campaigners Fuel Poverty Action fear the CMA will not take any meaningful action to curb bills and profits. Laura Hill, from the group, said: 'When the Big Six pocket billions of pounds in profit every year while one in four families decide whether to eat or heat their homes, I find it hard to understand how the CMA can say that profiteering energy companies have nothing to do with the current energy bill crisis.
'We are all sick and tired of the Government's inaction and excuses on fuel poverty. It's time they take stock and listen to the needs of the people and not profit-hungry companies. We need an energy system that is affordable, clean, public and democratic.'
The GMB union claimed the CMA inquiry would be a damp squib. Its national officer Gary Smith said: 'The inquiry was political cover in an attempt to divert attention from Labour's price freeze promise. If anyone believes the inquiry will deliver lower prices for energy users they will be very disappointed.
'While the heat on energy prices is off at the moment, the long-term trend, as the demand for energy continues to increase, is upwards.'

On Thursday, Collings, who is from Dorridge, in Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'The months following my return to the UK were absolutely terrifying as doctors only gave me a small chance of surviving my condition.

'I'm lucky really that I don't have to be on dialysis all my life but I shouldn't be in this situation at all.'
Upon returning home to the UK last summer, blood tests revealed that she had contracted e-coli and was also suffering from a rare kidney infection

Nicola was in Birmingham's Heartlands Hospital for two weeks and needed to take two months off from work to recover from her illness.
She has now instructed medical negligence lawyers to investigate the five-star hotel and travel company, Red Sea Holidays Ltd.
Nicola claims the pool area was dirty with murky water and that the food was  served lukewarm and with dirty cutlery.
She added: 'Although I'm now back at work I'm often shaking and tired and I still don't feel normal now ten months on.
'I also have to be careful about my health as my immune system is not that great and so I tend to get ill easily.
'I'm desperate to know what caused my illness as there could be other people affected who might not be as lucky as I was in surviving my condition.'

'It is extremely worrying to hear how severely ill Nicola became as a result of the illness she suffered.
'She has been through a traumatic experience and continues to suffer as a result of the illness she contracted.
'As we conduct our investigations we would urge anyone who stayed at the Siva Sharm Hotel and who may be able to provide information about the conditions there to get in contact with us as soon as possible.'

In a chilling investigation, the Mail today exposes how some of the countrys most respected charities use ruthless cold-calling techniques to prey on societys most vulnerable.
True, weve grown all too used to stories of payday lenders and unscrupulous salesmen seeking to extort money from the elderly, confused and hard-up.
But it is shocking when organisations such as the British Red Cross, Oxfam, the NSPCC and Macmillan Cancer Care are caught using immoral methods to target the defenceless.

After three weeks undercover, our Investigations Editor reports that fundraisers are instructed by their supervisors to be brutal and ferocious
After three weeks undercover at a call centre used by 40 leading charities, our Investigations Editor reports that fundraisers are instructed to be brutal and ferocious, accepting no excuse from the sick, the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed or those in debt.
Even when donors say they suffer from Alzheimers or dementia, call centre workers are told to press them for more.
In a grimly ironic touch, they are also taught how to handle questions about Olive Cooke, the 92-year-old poppy seller who took her own life after being inundated with charities demands.
Indeed, most frustrating of all for those who are pestered and persecuted is that theyre offered no escape from the barrage of calls.
Those who agree a monthly amount to donate may be phoned again within just six weeks and urged to give more. As for those who refuse, the charities wont take No for an answer  in some cases ringing as many as four times.
Meanwhile, the British Red Cross keeps donors data for up to three years, contacting them repeatedly after they have stopped contributing.
The calls often keep coming even after supporters have registered with the Government-approved Telephone Preference Service, which is supposed to protect us from unsolicited approaches.
Last night, the Information Commissioners Office vowed an immediate investigation into the Mails evidence, saying the charities involved could be breaking the law.
How much longer must the vulnerable be left to suffer before the law on cold-calling is rewritten to spell out that No means No?

Democracy v the euro
After the Greeks resounding rejection of the eurozones bailout package, it is anyones guess what happens next.
With a great deal of help from its creditors, Greece may yet limp on in the euro
With a great deal of help from its creditors, the country may yet limp on in the euro  though few would dare predict for how long. Or if Angela Merkel sticks to her tough demands for austerity, it may be driven to default on its debts and revert to the drachma.
Either way, the outlook for the birthplace of democracy, even as its people celebrate their cry of defiance through the ballot box, looks bleak for many years to come.
This paper makes one plea: will the champions of the single currency learn a lesson in humility from the suffering theyve caused?
Indeed, the euro was born of hubris (as so often, the Greeks had a word for it)  the political ambition to unite a whole continent under one government, with tax and spending dictated by Brussels.
But as the Mail warned at the time, and Peter Oborne argues on this page, this was putting the cart before the horse. A single currency cannot function without a common fiscal policy. And where nations as disparate as Germany and Greece are concerned, such a policy is incompatible with democracy.
Perhaps it is too much to hope that the eurofanatics will back off from their aim to exert centralised control.
But David Cameron must surely draw strength from the Greek nemesis, redoubling his efforts to repatriate powers and restore true meaning to democracy.

Women who take a year of maternity leave before having another baby shortly after are 'frustrating' for offices, Alexandra Shulman (pictured) has claimed
Women who take a year of maternity leave before having another baby shortly after are 'frustrating' for offices, the editor of Vogue has claimed.
Alexandra Shulman made the comments in an interview after revealing she only took four months off when she gave birth to her son.
The mother-of-one, who has edited the British version of the magazine for 23 years, added that she 'doesn't really get' working from home.
She told The Times magazine: 'I think [it] is frustrating for offices. You can't say, "Ooohhh, it's wonderful being away for a year, and now I am going to be away for another year".
'I can't pretend I think that's wonderful. I know I'm meant to...'
The comments were slammed by one parenting group, who said maternity leave 'is part of modern life'.
Rachel Burrows, from the UKs biggest parenting site Netmums, said: 'Ms Shulman raises some interesting points but while they may apply to staff at Vogue magazine, they are less relevant to the normal family.
'The latest figures show the average length of maternity leave is just six months while the average gap between siblings is now three years and eight months - so to suggest women are almost permanently pregnant or on maternity leave is simply wrong.
'Most mothers plan their families according to what they can afford and taking a year of maternity leave is a luxury available only to very few.
'The real issue here is that for many normal families, wages dont cover the cost of childcare, making part-time work with family help for childcare often the only viable option after children.
'Maternity leave is part of modern life so companies need to be wise and embrace what it can bring to improve both the company culture and the bottom line.'

However, many had no money before they even left  a quarter of those asked had gone on a holiday they couldnt really afford in the last year.
While one in five have booked a holiday knowing they will get into financial difficulty - a figure particularly high among young adults aged 25-34.
A quarter of the 25-34 age bracket said they had been on a stag or hen party they couldn't really afford in the past year.
But this isn't limited to younger adults as those with families also feel the strain.

One in five said the main reason they go away on holidays they can't afford is because it was their duty to provide a family holiday.
The top motive for heading abroad on holidays we can ill-afford is because we feel we 'deserved' the trip, while 22 per cent went on expensive trips because they felt obliged.
But some holiday-makers are also money-savvy.
Two-thirds will save up for part of, if not all, of the holiday, while 58 per cent prepare a budget for certain activities. 
The survey was conducted by the Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the Government to offer money tips.

'It's like looking for a green needle in a green haystack, but there are so many people out looking. It's half of Maidstone.'
Heavy-breathing Zombie is thought to have escaped by sneaking through one of Chris' conservatory doors.
Once in his garden, she is thought to slithered through the centre of town before reaching the long-grass 'heaven' beside Tesco.
Zombie - a Coastal Carpet Python - is one of nine pet snakes owned by reptile loving Chris Cini, who has spent the last 24 hours combing grass land to find his beloved pet
Mr Cini's wife Tracy reported Zombie - who feasts on rabbits and rats, bought for her by her owners - missing yesterday
A photo of the constrictor passing by a GP's surgery was posted on Facebook by local woman Sarah Bick.
It is seen with its head held high in the air with it's curving body in the short grass behind.
Mrs Bick uploaded the picture, saying urging the public to 'be careful'.
Kent Police confirmed that a member of the public contacted them to report seeing the snake  in the town's Chaucer Way.

A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'Our advice for anyone who spots a stray exotic (non-native) snake is to keep a safe distance, monitor the animal and call the RSPCA's Cruelty line.
'Never try to pick up a snake, unless absolutely certain that it has been correctly identified and that it is not venomous.'
To Chris, however, she's a joy to be around.

The footage then jumps back to the beach where two sunbathers in their swimsuits lie slumped on the ground having been caught in the gunfire.
The sun loungers that had been packed earlier in the day are now deserted, some stained with blood.
As the footage returns to the Sousse streets, the sound of gunfire pierces the silence once again and the person filming the video takes refuge behind a wall.

The gunman, who was laughing and joking among the midday bathers, was later shot dead by police after a rampage lasting at least 20 minutes.
Blood soaked bodies in swimsuits were left scattered among upturned sun loungers in what was the deadliest Islamist attack on westerners since the July 7 London bombings in 2005.
At least 39 people, including at least 15 Britons were slaughtered in the attack yesterday claimed by ISIS.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said today: 'I expect it (the number of British casualties) to increase. Most of the people were British and there were a large number of British caught up in the shooting.'
Thomson and First Choice today sent 10 planes to evacuate tourists from the Northern African state.
They said several of the people killed and injured were their customers and they were working closely with the local authorities to confirm the exact details of casualties.
Meanwhile Thomas Cook, which has sent an additional plane to the country to help bring home its own tourists, is offering holidaymakers the chance to change or cancel future bookings to Tunisia free of charge.
David Cameron is due to chair a meeting of senior ministers today to discuss the response to the attack in Tunisia.

	France is to pay almost 40 million pounds in compensation to foreign Holocaust victims. The US deal was rubber stamped by MPs on Wednesday night, paving the way for pay-outs around the world.

France has slowly owned up to the part it played in the atrocity, and has already paid out some 40 million pounds to its own nationals affected by it.
Now those who took on new nationalities in countries such as America and Israel will be eligible for money, as will their relatives.
But there was anger at the deal in some quarters, because it is reliant on the United States protecting Frances immunity in regard to Holocaust deportation claims filed in America.

Rail workers and police were among those who assisted occupying Third Reich forces in deporting some 76,000 Jews during the Second World War, and only around 3000 survived

France is to pay almost 40 million pounds in compensation to foreign victims of its wartime Holocaust. A vote on the bill will be held on July 9 where it is expected to pass.
Former French transport minister Thierry Mariani said: Compensation to victims of the Holocaust is a must but this deal with the USA is humiliating and unacceptable.
Patrick Balkany, an MP whose father was deported to Auschwitz concentration camp from Paris, said: My father would turn in his grave if he knew about this text.
Last month a new complaint was filed in Chicago by Holocaust victim descendants against SNCF.

Former French transport minister Thierry Mariani said: Compensation to victims of the Holocaust is a must but this deal with the USA is humiliating and unacceptable
Such actions have proved extremely problematic for SNCF, as they prevent them winning contracts in the USA. The new deal is ultimately aimed at ending this.
In December 2014, U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a long time campaigner for the compensation deal, hailed the proposed deal as a 'breakthrough in a decades-long struggle for justice.'
The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, also welcomed the accord.
'There is no amount of money that could ever make up for the horrific injustice done to these victims and their families,' said Abraham Foxman, ADL's national director and a Holocaust survivor.
'But agreements like this provide some modest redress, an important recognition of their pain, and acknowledge the responsibility of governments and institutions to leave no stone unturned in seeking every possible measure of justice for Holocaust victims.'

	The British Red Cross, NSPCC, Oxfam and Macmillan have all been exploiting loopholes in the Telephone Preference Service, which was set up to protect the elderly from cold callers.
      </Description>

Major charities, including the NSPCC, the British Red Cross and Macmillan, were found to be calling people who were registered with the Telephone Preference Service.
Such people have deliberately opted out of receiving unsolicited calls.
But a loophole means that if they have failed at any point to read the small print in privacy policies, and dont object to receiving calls, they lose the protection of the TPS system.
After reviewing the Mails evidence, Stephen Eckersley, the ICOs Head of Enforcement, said: Wed like to thank the Daily Mail for bringing this to our attention. On the face of it this could be a breach of both the Data Protection Act and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.
We will be launching an investigation into the call centre and charities involved.
He said charities must follow the same rules on marketing by calls or texts as any other company. Rule breakers face fines of up to 500,000.
Existing supporters are harassed repeatedly to increase their donations  with some Macmillan supporters being called four times in a row, even if they have already said no.
Richard Lloyd, of the consumer group Which?, said: The Government must now carry out a full review of fundraising rules and regulations to put an end to this and save the sectors reputation.
Bernard Jenkin, the Tory chairman of the Commons public administration committee, said: The Daily Mail is right to expose this, and I will be asking my committee to look into it. Dame Esther Rantzen, a trustee at the NSPCC, said she was horrified her charity had been calling vulnerable people on no call lists.
She said: I welcome the investigation, I think it is really important.
The Fundraising Standards Board  the self-regulatory body for charities in the UK  said it was very concerned by the revelations and would investigate fully.
All of the charities denied acting unlawfully but said they would look into the Mails evidence as a matter of urgency.

Oxfam is among those to have been using London-based GoGen, a company that carries out campaigns for 40 of Britain's biggest charities
A spokesman for the British Red Cross said the charity was deeply concerned by the claims. She said the charity believed it was obeying the law on the TPS but will be seeking clarification from the ICO and Institute of Fundraising. The NSPCC said it had contractual arrangements in place with those that fundraise on our behalf, including strict guidance on vulnerable people, and expect the highest standards of behaviour.
But it added: Any suggestion of inappropriate activity is deeply worrying and we would want any concerns to be raised with us immediately so that they can be quickly addressed.
A Macmillan spokesman said: We take the claims made by the Daily Mail seriously and are looking into these as a priority.
We do not wish to contact people if we are aware this is unwanted. We take the requests of our supporters very seriously and all supporters can choose to unsubscribe from communications at any time.
We would not hesitate to take robust action if we found our agencies were not acting with upmost integrity on our behalf.
Oxfam said it had suspended all telephone fundraising activity to ensure companies who work on our behalf meet not only the regulatory standards but also our own high moral and ethical standards.
It said the dementia and Alzheimers policy was all about enabling people with dementia to live as full a life as possible, including supporting their favourite charity.
Tim Hunter, fundraising director, said: Oxfam fights for the rights of poor and vulnerable people across the world and we apply our values to all aspects of our work. We would never exploit an individuals vulnerability in our marketing.
Our guidelines around telephone fundraising are also aligned to those of the Institute of Fundraising, who consulted the Alzheimers Society, Scope and AgeUK.
Our agencies have clear, regulated policies that help strike the appropriate balance between enabling people with dementia to live as full a life as possible, including supporting their favourite charity, and protecting them from the vulnerability caused by dementia.
Yesterday it also emerged that Save The Children had decided to end cold-calling.
Giuseppe Iantosca of GoGen said he had suspended two members of staff while the firm investigated the Mails evidence.
He also said GoGen would not ask those with dementia for money in future.

Inside the call centre sweatshop: Aggressive, ruthless and cynical, the bosses giving 7.30 an hour staff a ten minute briefing and a script before they hit the phones
By Katherine Faulkner
Inside a sweltering training room in a shabby warehouse we were told exactly what to expect from our jobs as charity telephone fundraisers.
The whole point of it is going to be asking people for money, our trainer, Callum, told us bluntly. That is what were here to do. Were not an information line.
He warned us about the string of protests we should expect from the people we called.
Im a pensioner, Im retired, Im 87 years old, Im unemployed, I just went on maternity leave, our mortgage payments just went up  . Reeling off his list in a bored voice as he swigged from a water bottle, Callum told us that we should become experts in deflecting these objections.
Pep talk: Supervisor Glyn told staff they had to care about the charity's cause 'whether you do or don't'
Undercover footage reveals GoGen training techniques
Then, we should ask them for money again  three times, in fact, in every single call. Situated in a run-down area of Dalston, east London, the GoGen call centre  and its 7.30-an-hour staff  are entrusted by big charities with national campaigns.
The British Red Cross, NSPCC, Oxfam, Macmillan cancer support, Cancer Research UK and Save the Children all rely on the centre. Bosses, who come to work in the stuffy office in shorts and vests, claim the atmosphere is relaxed.
Yet employees are scolded if they are even a minute late  and are ordered not to laugh too loudly in the grubby corridors in case it makes too much noise. And there is nothing casual about the companys attitude to raising money. In a spirit of aggression that seems at odds with charitable giving, bosses demand brutal and ferocious requests for money.
Fundraisers are told to get charity supporters on the back foot, where we need them to be.
We are now going to take it up a level. I want to hear much more ferocious asks, we were told at the beginning of one shift by Hadley, a supervisor.
If you are tempted by any kind of fluffy language, take it out of your vocabulary. More ferocity in your asks  because lets face it, you know it works. Its time to get the persuader out, and hit it really hard.
In a practice that causes misery for families, telephone fundraisers must call people in their homes and on their mobile phones until 9pm.
At the beginning of each call, they must make two attempts to persuade the person to talk to them.
If on the first attempt the person says Im just going out or Im in a bit of a hurry, they must try again, saying something like Oh, itll just be a couple of minutes  is that OK?
Trainer Callum told the undercover Mail reporter that the call centre was 'not an information line' and the whole point of the role was simply asking people for money
Once the person has agreed, they continue with the call, during which they must make three separate attempts to get a donation.
They are supposed to call up to 80 numbers an hour.
In many cases, nobody will even answer the phone  while other calls last just a few seconds because people do not want to talk. Most people we called on behalf of the charities would assume we had a personal connection with the causes. In fact most of the employees of GoGen know next to nothing about the charities.
Most are just scruffily-dressed students, desperate to make some extra cash during the holidays.
And they are given only a short briefing  lasting about ten minutes  on a charitys work before being told to start calling supporters and asking for cash. Sometimes fundraisers will even be switched from one charity campaign to another halfway through a shift.
On one occasion, having spent the first 15 minutes of a shift talking to people about the Nepal earthquake for the British Red Cross, I was suddenly asked to switch campaigns. Within minutes, I had to start talking to Macmillan supporters about Britains cancer care crisis instead. Despite this, we were under huge pressure to sound passionate about the causes we were calling on behalf of  whether or not we actually were.
One supervisor, Glyn, told us: Regardless whether youre an animal lover or not, every single person youre speaking to today  they care about the polar bears, they care about tigers and leopards, they care about the planet.
So today, you do too. Whether you do or dont  today you do.
All the fundraisers will be reading from scripts provided by the charities  which they are told to stick to religiously. There is a different script for every campaign. Some charities will be carrying out several different campaigns at the same time.
And there will often be people in the same room calling on behalf of three or four different charities  such as Macmillan, the British Red Cross and the NSPCC  all at the same time. This often produced a deafening background noise, with overlapping monologues about cancer, child abuse and disasters.
Every single fundraiser could be heard telling someone it was urgent that they donate, right now.
On top of the noise of the other fundraisers reading from scripts were the shouted instructions from supervisors  usually berating us for not making enough money.
'I want more ferocity': Call centre supervisor Hadley
If we were falling behind on our targets, supervisors would shout that it was not good enough and tell us: This next call has got to be a yes.
If they suspected we were not being aggressive enough, they would listen in to our phone calls to make sure we were always asking for money three times.
The scripts are carefully designed to pack the biggest emotional punch possible  and to make it sound like asking for money isnt the main reason for the call.
Were going to be asking for money, Callum explained. But we dont want to be saying  Yeah Im going to be asking for money.
And during the calls, members of the public are assured by telephone fundraisers that their donations go straight to those most in need.
But in fact, tens of thousands of pounds from every campaign must first be paid to the call centre  before a single penny reaches the charity. The public are informed about this fact only at the very end of the call  after they have agreed to donate and handed over bank details.
Legal experts who examined the campaign scripts used by the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Macmillan and the NSPCC said such a practice was concerningly close to a breach of the law.
A lawyer for Which?, who specialises in consumer law, said: Some people might choose not to donate if they had that information before their donation was finalised.
Therefore, providing this information late in the call could be in breach of consumer law  specifically the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations.
If it is information that the average person needs to know when choosing whether to donate, then it should not be withheld until the end of the call.
The NSPCC tell donors that 4 a month could help them answer 12 calls to Childline from children suffering family problems, self-harm and abuse. Only after they have agreed are donors told that of the 120,000 the NSPCC expects to raise on the campaign, more than half  65,000  is expected to go to the call centre.
In a script for a Red Cross campaign, callers are told to tell donors that popping an extra 1 on to your monthly gift will buy three foil blankets for those in Nepal.
Donors are told: This means over a year, we can give more than 30 people warmth and comfort in their hour of need.
However, at the end of the call  after their donation has been accepted  fundraisers have to say that the call centre is being paid 150,000 for the appeal.
This is one of four Red Cross campaigns currently run by GoGen  for which the call centre is set to receive 434,100 in total. Each campaign lasts only a few weeks.
Macmillan Cancer Support tells donors that simply adding an extra pound or two to their monthly donations would make a huge difference to ensuring that no one has to face cancer alone.
Then, before the conversation ends and the donor is thanked for their money, the caller adds: GoGen will be paid approximately 55,000 for carrying out this campaign.
Telephone fundraisers are also faced with dozens of people who were angry that they were being called.
GoGen accepts millions every year from the charities for these campaigns and its bosses are thought to take home large salaries.
Chairman Nicholas Smith, 48, who owns more than half of the business, lives in a 1.2million apartment in Blackheath, South East London. He owns a second home in the Midlands.
Finance director Robert Metrebian, 53, owns a 1.3million detached property in Woodford Green, Essex, and often boasts on social media of his lavish lifestyle.
On Facebook he writes of drinking expensive wine to excess and evenings dining out.
Director Giuseppe Iantosca, 36, lives in a 1.2million terrace in Dalston. He said he had suspended two members of staff while they investigated the Mails evidence.
He also said GoGen would not be asking anyone with dementia for money in future.
He said the old policy was approved by the Fundraising Standards Board  and inspired by a belief that age and mental health are not reasons to discriminate against people who want to donate.
Mr Iantosca added: GoGen do not support, condone or agree with any of the alleged statements made by staff members. We will be reviewing the processes and criteria by which members of staff are inducted into our training and supervisory teams.

Pictured are two clowns carnival organisers say have been selling overpriced balloons
Festival organisers are warning the public to watch out for a rogue gang of clowns who they claim are ripping off parents with overpriced balloons at street carnivals.
The rogue entertainers are believed to have targeted a number of large public events in the past year by sneaking into processions uninvited.
They then create sword-shaped balloons before charging parents anything between 2 and 5 for them, as well as money to have their photos taken with kids.
Organisers of next weekend's carnival in Melksham, Wiltshire, who were previously targeted by the alleged fraudsters, have now issued a public warning.
They have also released a picture of the two clowns at last year's event, in a bid to warn them off this year's procession.
A statement from Melksham Carnival Committee said: 'These individuals joined the procession without our prior knowledge or agreement and sold balloons by giving them to children and then asking the parents for money.
'They are nothing to do with carnival and sneak into the procession while we are setting up the entries.
'They also went to the park last year and had photos taken with children and charged parents for the privilege.
'They do not give anything to us or to the town and they make a small fortune from you.
'If you see anyone selling balloons or anything apart from our official programmes then please do not give them your money.

In 1862, one of the girls, Charlotte Jane Bennette was burned to death while deliberately locked up in a bathroom  it is said that she still haunts the building.
Later during the First World War the building was requisitioned as a hospital to care for thousands of wounded servicemen.
Following the conflict, the building returned to being an orphanage until 1938, when the children were evacuated in anticipation of German bombing raids in the Second World War.
Fascinating history: The flat is part of theRoyal Victoria Patriotic Building, which wasbuilt in 1859 as an asylum for orphaned girls
Celebrity occupant:A recent chapter in the flat's illustrious history saw it owned by a member of Duran Duran in 1981
In deep contrast to its previous use, the building became an MI6 clearing, detention and interrogation centre.
Interrogators, including 'spy catcher' Colonel Oreste Pinto, interviewed over 30,000 immigrants to the UK over a four year period.
It was reported that Hitler's deputy, Rudolf Hess, who flew to Britain on a 'peace mission', was held and questioned there.
After the war the building became a teacher training college and in 1952 was bought by London County Council - five years later becoming Honeywell Secondary Mixed School.
In another twist of fate, the school failed, fell into disrepair and closed in 1974. The empty building soon attracted vandals and thieves, who ransacked the place andstole lead from the roof and water tanks.
The building was marked for demolition, but was instead given Grade II listed status after campaigning by the Victorian Society and Wandsworth Society.
Grade II listed: The property is located in Wandsworth Common andis said to be haunted following the death of a girl here in 1862
Grand interior: The 3million flat has a huge central living area and is located in Wandsworth Common, in south London
Shelter for wounded: During the First World War the building was requisitioned as a hospital to care for thousands of wounded sodliers
In 1980 the Greater London Council put the building up for sale and it was eventually sold for 1 to the company now called South of the Border Holdings, under the agreement that the fabric was fully restored.
Just before the formal handover, the main hall, which has an elaborate hammer beam ceiling, was destroyed by arson. It was fully restored from a photographic survey, which had been made two weeks earlier. Restoration of the building took six years.
In 1985 the Civic Trust awarded a commendation for the hall ceiling and in 1987 the restoration also won the Europa Nostra Order of Merit.
The building is now a mixed-use development, including studios and workshops, a French bar and restaurant 'Le Gothique' and 29 apartments.
The property is being sold on sellmyhome.co.uk , and the company offers a unique virtual tour of the building on their website.

Flight tracking data showed the plane make a u-turn over Europe, and head back over the Channel.
The plane was a Boeing 777-200 and had a scheduled land time in Kuwait of 9.25pm (BST).
Al Jazeera have reportedly said the landing was forced due to an outbreak of food poisoning on board.
This has also been declared the reason by Russia Today UK news, who took to Twitter to report it.
Sky's Tom Parmenter told the news channel: 'It is something because of that terror attack in Kuwait yesterday, there is more reason to take note of a Kuwait bound jet turning round over Europe in midair and landing in London.'
On Friday at least 27 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Kuwait when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque.
Islamic State have since declared responsibility for the attack.
The flightpath shows the plane had to turn back over Europe and landed in the UK

Former newsagent Mr Collinge died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage - bleeding on the brain caused by trauma - after the attack on October 8, 2011.
Nottingham Crown Court heard that Collinge had told her friend Jessica Dawkins earlier that day that she 'wanted her husband dead'.
Former newsagent Mr Collinge (pictured) died from a subarachnoid haemorrhage - bleeding on the brain caused by trauma - after the attack in 2011
Closing the prosecution case on Tuesday, prosecutor Peter Joyce QC said his wife stepped over Mr Collinge as he lay dying in a pool of blood.
He added: 'What happens after the killing? What does she [Mrs Collinge] do?
'One is someone with whom she had a sexual thing some years before, Stan Boardman, and the other, her husband, she loves to bits, and he is lying on the floor groaning in a pool of blood. He's dying.
'Does she help him? No. Does she speak to him? No. Does she hold him? No.
'What does she do? She steps over him to go upstairs and she comes back down and she steps over him again. She goes out and she rings her boyfriend.'
Mr Joyce QC said Collinge then went back into the house for a second time but still didn't try to help her dying husband.
He added: 'Does she talk to Cliff? No. Does she hold Cliff? No. Does she cradle him, does she touch him at all? No.
'She steps over him again and she steps over him again on the way outside. She wouldn't have done that to her dog.
'And if it had been her daughter who was attacked by an intruder? Would she have helped her? Yes. Why not Cliff?
'You know why not. She wanted him dead.'
Collinge, Shreeves and Dale, all from Warsop, deny murdering Mr Collinge.
Shreeves and Dale also deny assault causing actual bodily harm to Mr Boardman on the same day.
Giving evidence in the trial, pathologist Dr Guy Rutty said there were at least 46 separate blows or injuries to Mr Collinge.
Mr Joyce QC added: 'You will remember what he was saying about the bones to the head and the fractured skull and the air embolism that killed him.
Nottingham Crown Court (pictured) heard that Collinge had told friend Jessica Dawkins earlier that day that she 'wanted her husband dead'
'Every rib, pretty much, was multiply fractured. There was fracture after fracture consistent with stamping and jumping on him.'
Earlier in the trial, the jury heard Collinge confessed to killing her husband moments after he was bludgeoned to death.
Giving evidence, PCSO Georgina Fletcher told the jury that she arrived at the house shortly after 10pm and saw Mr Collinge lying on the floor in a pool of blood.
She said: 'Charlotte Collinge came from around the back of the house to the window.
'She stepped within a few feet of me and said 'oh my God, I think I've just killed him'.
'She came across as quite nervous. She was a bit jittery as she said it and was crying.
'She went from crying to all of a sudden very straight-faced and very calm.. She said 'I haven't killed him. I found him lying on the floor in blood'..'
But Michael Auty QC, defending Collinge, said under cross-examination that the words could have been 'I think they've killed him'.
He added: 'You made a mistake in what you heard.'
The trial continues.

	RICHARD LITTLEJOHN: This column decided to consult our own resident expert, one of the most prominent members of the Greek community in Britain, Harry Enfield's character Stavros.

Stavros come here 40 years ago, used to be nice but now it feel like a foreign country. Nobody even speaka the Queen's Inglis, like what I does.
An' doner get me starting on the Muslins, either. Tottingham High Road like downtown Afghanistan, all the pubs shut cos the Muslins don't drink, innit?
As a small busy man, I've always vote Conservatory, ever since Grocer Heathcliffe. Pity we can't bring back Mrs Thatch
Last Friday, I had gang of kids calling themself Al Murray or summink, waving that black Izal flag, an' telling me this was now a Muslin area subjeck to Cherie Amour, whoever she is, so I wasn't allow to sell beers no more or they gonna chop off my head and put me on Bookface.
Had to chase them away with my kebab knife.
All the wimmins in black berks, everything cover up except eyeholes. Is like looking at someone through letter-box.
Someone sez that Mr Akhbar, nice man what runs public convenience store next to where the bookies used to be, anyway his daughter, only a slip of a girl, has run away to join Izal in Syriza and become yee-haw bride.
Every peeps weepin' and wailin' and blamin' Old Bill, like they always do especially over riots an' all. But if you ask me, good rids. Make a change Muslins goin' over there instead of coming over here.
Lol, I say, innit?
Drone captures thousands celebrating 'no' vote in Athens
When I move to Tottingham from Greece, Stavros was only kebab taking-away for miles. Peeps beating path to door from all over. Now kebabs everywhere, Lebanese, Somalis, Moroccos, very bad for my busy. If this is what they call single market, they can stuff it. Too much cheap competition.
These peeps they come over here, they try take my job and most of them getting benefits, and free council houses, too, on account of breeding like radishes.
Is not only Greece in deep doggy-doo, kebab busy is not what it was. My takings well down, even though my dolmades voted best in town three years running by readers of Haringey Shopper.
Just today, I get a cheque sent back from the Banko Kleftiko, mark 'Return to Drawer'. What drawer, I thinking to myself. Cutlery drawer, sock drawer, drawer where I keep my Demis Roussos cassettes?
So I rings Mr Papadopolis, the manager of the Palmers Green branch, only there no reply, just recording mess which say Banko Kleftiko close until further notices.
Same story at Banko Stifado, in Finsbury Park. When I try putting my card in hole-in-wall, it start flashing 'No money left' like that note from Labour peeps at Treasury when Call Him Dave become Prime Minister. What they mean 'no money'? Is bank, innit? How's a bank run out of money? That's like kebab shop running out of lamb.
How am I s'pose pay for my season ticket to the Arse? I always support Arse, even though most peeps round here are supporting Tottingham, or a least they did before they all moved out to Cheshunt to get away from the immigrants.
Tottingham High Road like downtown Afghanistan, all the pubs shut cos the Muslins don't drink, innit?
Good job I still got suitcase full of drachmas, what I brought over when I immigrate from Greece. Accord to Sky on the telly, what I have on in shop for the football, now that Greeks vote 'No' to Urals, they going back to drachma, so could come in handy.
I dunno what Greece doin' in the Urals anyway. Last time I looked, Urals in Russia. Now it say that Russia will bale out Greeks, so maybe it will be roubles in future, not drachmas.
Simple currency always stupid idea. One-size-fit-all, my moustache. How could what fits Germs also fit Greece? You seen size of some of them frauleins? Big birds, they are, struggle to squeeze into a berk.
All that bratwurst, I guess, not like healthy kebab and nice salad what Stavros sells. You wan' chilli sauce with that, missus?
Still, no surprise to me that Greeks go belly-up. I went for holiday, see my family last year. None of my relatives have done an honest day's work for donkey's things.
My cousin Theo, lazy git employ by Ministry of Olives since left school, got 13 month salary ever year, never paid any tax and retired at 50 on three pensions.
I say to Her-Inside-The-Doors, this gotta end in tears, marking my words. One day the Germ prez, Mrs Merton, is going to get fed up with footing the bills. That's when the bubble is gonna burst.
Very fun, Stav, she says. Bubble being what peeps in Tottingham call Greeks. Is Cockerney rhyme slang. Bubble and Squeak rhyme with Greek, innit? But you only use first bit, Bubble, not Squeak.
You the Bubble what's gonna burst unless you lay off the moussaka, Stav, she say. Not me, I say. I'm on 5:2 diet. Some days I eat five kebabs, other days only two.
I'll be voting 'No' when Call Him Dave has his referee on Europe. Might stop foreigners flooding over here at last
Greece is the bursting bubble wrap. Complete chicken-in-a-basket case. Good job we living in Tottingham.
As a small busy man, I work all hours, like Ronnie Barker in that funny prog with Del Boy as delivery man and Nurse Emmanuel with the big bouzoukis.
But apart from me and Mr Akhbar, who I aforemenched a min ago, no one else in Tottingham seem to do any work at all, except robbin', sellin' drugs and claiming the Old Nat King Cole.
If we's not carefree, I sez to Her-Inside-The-Doors, this country could go same way as Greece. Britain got even bigger debts than Greeks and that buy-to-let flat what I bought in Leytonstone with the zero-hours mortgage for my old age is look decidedly dodge.
It's juss as well we got Ian Dunkin-Donuts and Boy George Osborne, not Gormless Brown or Ed Millerband, running things. As a small busy man, I've always vote Conservatory, ever since Grocer Heathcliffe. Pity we can't bring back Mrs Thatch.
I might not be getting Post-It vote in Greece, but I do get vote in Tottingham and I'll be voting 'No' when Call Him Dave has his referee on Europe.
Might stop foreigners flooding over here at last. And there's only one simple currency we need, that's the Great British Pound-in-your-pocket.
Hello, Mr Farage peeps. You was dead right about Greece, innit? Usual? Double shish kebab, six-pack of Greek beer and a litre of Retsina comin' up. You want chilli sauce? Thought not.
That'll be 25.99 for cash. No, sorry, we don't accept cheques. Do you mind your change in drachmas?

'But the thing is children want to reach the end of these games and they won't understand that it costs lots of money.'
Mr Leith, from Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, initially registered his card details on Facebook so that he could occasionally buy apps or games.
After that, every time his son, Alexander, logged on to the account before school he was able to make charges to the card without any verification.
Certain levels of Juice Jam can only be reached if the player has enough 'gold coins' to reach them
These can be bought in packages which cost players between 60p and 63. In Alexander's case, he bought a number of the 63 packages.
Mr Leith said  he is 'furious' with the makers of 'Juice Jam' for making it so easy for children to make purchases.
'It's so easy to spend money on your credit card on Facebook,' he said. 'I've since taken my card details off my profile. You should have to enter a password or security code to make a purchase.'
Mr Leith, who said he had been planning to put the money towards setting up his own business, added that he didn't blame his son 'at all'.
He said: 'It's easily done and he's too young to understand. Because of his autism he gets a bit fixated with games. Very few things can hold his concentration.
'At first we just told him Facebook was broken but he got upset and kept asking to play the game.
'In the end I showed him the invoices and explained to him that the game cost money and daddy couldn't afford. He understood but he was very sad.
'He was only playing it briefly in the mornings before school, it wasn't long enough for me to get charged that extortionate amount.
'I know business is business, but there need to be better safeguards to protect children and the vulnerable.'
A spokeswoman for the game's software developer SGN, said: 'SGN makes games based on the parameters set by the platforms it publishes on including Facebook, iOS, Google Play and Amazon.
'Juice Jam is a free-to-play game, with optional in-app purchases that are not required in order to finish the game.
'The company also handles all customer service inquiries within 24 hours and refunds accidental purchases or unintended transactions when appropriate.
'This particular inquiry from the UK was handled by customer service within 12 hours of receiving, where they were given refund information and advised to increase their Facebook security options.
'SGN is also fully compliant with the Children's Online Protection Act.'
Following a complaint to Facebook, the social network has since offered Mr Leith a one-time only refund.
CAUGHT OUT BY IN-APP CHARGES: FAMILIES WHO FACED MASSIVE BILLS wH
Last August, a mother was left horrified after her son unwittingly racked up a 1,000 bill in just two weeks by playing online games.
Kay Flanders, 49, was stunned to discover that 11-year-old Liam's 10 a month phone bill had rocketed to 850.
He had signed up as a member of online game Small Worlds - where users create their own virtual universes - until 2020.
And, unknown to her, he had bought optional extras such as credits to buy special items and VIP membership which grants exclusive access to other parts of the game.

Meanwhile, in September 2012, a schoolboy unwittingly racked up a 2,000 credit card bill playing an online game on his grandfathers iPad.
Six-year-old Will Smith was innocently playing the popular childrens video game Tiny Monsters until his grandfather Barry Slatter, 55, was contacted by the fraud squad.
The family was unaware of little Wills huge spending spree until his grandmother tried to use the credit card at Tesco, only to have it declined.
Families have also been caught out by in-game charges on a number of mobile phone apps.
In March 2013,eight-year-old Theo Rowland-Fryracked up an enormous 980 bill for his parents while playing a Simpsons game on the iPad.

'Jeremy is all bombastic and [thinks] he's a brilliant businessman and he knows f*** all,' Mr Wilman, who first met Clarkson when they were students together at Repton school, told the Guardian. 
The BBC decided not to renew Clarkson's contract following an internal review, which found he was responsible for the 'unprovoked physical and verbal attack' on producer Oisin Tymon.
But Top Gear has been dogged by controversies almost since the beginning, the most famous of which include referring to Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot', and to Mexicans as lazy, feckless and flatulent.
The BBC was forced to apologise for the latter following a complaint lodged by the Mexican embassy.
BBC release trailer for final Top Gear episode featuring Clarkson
On form: The final show has been put together using films before Clarkson's contract was not renewed by the BBC, following a 'physical and verbal' attack on a producer in March
Looking to the future: The team are currently in talks with Netflix, ITV and Amazon Prime for the rights to the new show
Controversial: The BBC2 show has been plagued by controversy since it's beginning, including calling Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'
Mr Wilman is less than impressed by the series of offences, describing them as 'abysmal'.
'It was charmless, badly delivered and s***,' he continued.
'If you are making a show with a mental age of nine, you are going to act like a nine-year-old and at some point you are going to lose focus.'
The 75-minute final show will air at 8pm tomorrow night, and is expected to smash the show's current viewer record, of 8.4million.
Final screening: The final episode of the show will air at 8pm tomorrow night, and is expected to smash the show's current viewer record of 8.4million
New deal: But the team will not be able to keep the Top Gear name, as it was bought by the BBC three years ago in a multimillion pound deal that benefited Clarkson and Mr Wilman.
Camaraderie: According to Andy Wilman, the clips used in the final show are not their best, but are strong on camaraderie
The current record-holder is the episode that featured Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton as the 'star in the reasonably-priced' car in 2007.
Prior to that was the episode that featured Richard Hammond's return to the show following his near-fatal crash during filming in September 2006, which drew 8.1million viewers.
But the team are looking to the future, with ITV, Netflix and Amazon Prime currently battling it out for the rights for the new show, which is tipped for success.
Although they will not be able to keep the Top Gear name, as it was bought by the BBC three years in a multimillion pound deal that benefited Clarkson and Mr Wilman.
Chris Evans laughs off claims Clarkson was offered Top Gear job
Take over: The show will be handed over to Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has taken on the roles of both presenter and executive producer
Mr Wilman revealed that the team are now looking for a 'global platform', beyond that of Top Gear's record 350million fans around the world. 
But the original will be handed over to the Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has taken on the roles of presenter and executive producer for next year's return.
Evans is understood to be seeking more audience participation, with open auditions for the co-presenting role and opportunity for viewers to drive around the Top Gear track.
Wilman ended: 'Chris will do a good job of his type of show. It will be a healthy rivalry, there will be room for both of us.'

Today the hearing heard that trainees at the time were treated as 'skivvies' to first team players and it was 'part of the culture of the club to maintain a distance between first team players and apprentices.'
He was described as feeling 'humiliated' after the 'painful, intrusive and immediately distressing' abuse and is now prescribed Temazepam and sleeping tablets.
Mr Blackstock said: 'I feel, to be honest with you, it has destroyed me as a person over the last years having to deal with him (Fox). It all came back to the forefront, it's been very difficult mentally and psychologically.'
He was asked what he was hoping to achieve in pursuing the case.
He added: 'What am I hoping to achieve? I want these people who inflicted this on me to be held accountable for their actions.'
He said he was left needing therapy which had been helpful in some ways, but explained: 'In others, no, because having to relive it all again is quite traumatic.
He also says that falling short of his first-team duties, he was allegedly held down by a number of first team players while being attacked by Fox, pictured
'I would probably say I will need more treatment when I return home to Belfast.'
Representing Mr Blackstock, Aswini Weereratne QC said: 'It is very much his case that the practice of was unacceptable in 1986 and is unacceptable today.
'His claim for damages, that he had been physically assaulted by Mr Fox between 1986 and 1988.
'It is his case that these two assaults had a profound effect on him psychologically and also that it had an effect on his ability to play professional football.
'It is a type of dispute often referred to as David and Goliath battle. David is Mr Blackstock, who was aged between 15 and 16.'
The court also heard that part of his role was to do 'menial jobs' for first team players such as cleaning their boots, setting out their kits and putting them in the laundry. Trainees were also required to clean up dressing rooms and showers.
Ms Weereratne added: 'The apprentices did all this, they skivvied for the first team players.'
She also told the hearing that the traineeship had been 'a prized apprenticeship at an English football club' with Mr Blackstock leaving his home in Belfast in July 1986 to take the place.
Mr Blackstock must prove the two assaults and also the damages he has suffered as a result. In relation to Stoke City he must prove vicarious liability.
Stoke City Football Club and Fox deny Mr Blackstock's claims.

Councillors have unanimously refused a planning application for fracking in Lancashire in a move which has been welcomed by environmental campaigners.
Lancashire County Council's development control committee turned down Cuadrilla's application to explore for shale gas by drilling, hydraulically fracking and testing the flow of gas at Roseacre Wood, Roseacre, between Preston and Blackpool.
The vote was in line with recommendations by planning officials who said it should be turned down because it would cause an increase in traffic which would result in 'an unacceptable impact' on rural roads and reduce road safety.

The committee has yet to reach a decision on a second proposal at Fylde, Lancashire, at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, which planning officers have recommended should go ahead.
The decision on Preston New Road has been deferred to Monday.

Marcus Johnstone, cabinet member for environment, planning and cultural services, and a member of the development control committee, said: 'The development control committee has listened very carefully to many hours of evidence both for and against the proposal, and considered the report of the council's planning officers.
'The decision to refuse this application has been reached by a vote of the committee and each member of the committee has ultimately cast their vote based on the evidence they have heard and whether they think the proposal is acceptable.'
Friends of the Earth welcomed the decision to block the proposed plant at Rosacre Wood
Friends of the Earth north west campaigner Furqan Naeem said: 'This is a tremendous victory for local people and everyone across Lancashire and the UK who have been tirelessly highlighting the risks fracking poses to their quality of life and the climate.
'But the fracking threat still hangs ominously over the community near Preston New Road.
'Poll after poll shows people want renewables, not fracking - and the clean energy and long-term jobs they would provide.
'Lancashire councillors must put local people and our environment first and reject Cuadrilla's controversial application when they meet next Monday.'
In a statement, shale company Cuadrilla said: 'We are disappointed but not surprised that Lancashire County Council's development control committee has denied planning consent for our application at Roseacre Wood as their decision follows a negative recommendation by the council's planning officers.
'We are committed to the responsible exploration and development of the huge quantity of natural gas locked up in the shale rock deep underneath Lancashire.
'We will now take time to consider our options, including our right to appeal.'
Cuadrilla said it was confident that its proposed route, road improvements and traffic management plan were safe and suitable for the modest level of HGV journeys associated with the Roseacre Wood site and met all necessary guidelines.
'If we can unlock this shale gas potential it will help create jobs, generate economic growth, help fuel and heat local businesses and homes, and boost local tax revenues for Lancashire,' the company said.
Footage captures moment massive flames erupt from tank
The Preston New Road planning application remains the focus of hot dispute, with legal advice published today warning that rejecting the application for fracking because of its visual and landscape impacts would be 'unreasonable' in planning terms.
Councillors have been under 'intolerable pressure' in making the final ruling on the controversial process of releasing gas.
The Government has said it is going 'all out for shale', claiming it would create jobs and growth, reduce energy prices and cut the country's reliance on gas imports.
But opponents have raised fears that the process causes earthquakes, can pollute water supplies, could lead to inappropriate development in the countryside and damage house prices.
Environmental campaigners and local opponents of fracking have been protesting outside the council's offices in Preston calling for councillors to reject the two proposals.
Hydraulic fracturing - or fracking - involves pumping water, chemicals and sand at high pressure underground to fracture shale rock and release the gas trapped in it.
Greenpeace UK energy and climate campaigner Daisy Sands said: 'Today's decision is a victory for local democracy over corporate arrogance and government meddling, and a shot across the bow of the fracking industry in Lancashire.
'Yesterday we saw local councillors paralysed by fears of a legal challenge from the frackers on a separate application.
'Today the people's elected representatives found their voice again and shouted a very clear 'no' to Cuadrilla's plans.
'Tens of thousands of Lancashire residents will now be hoping that, emboldened by today's decision, the councillors will ignore the enormous pressure from ministers and the fracking lobby, and stop fracking at the Preston New Road site too.'

	The head of the UK's National Air Traffic Services told an aviation conference it is only a matter of time before the new technology is implemented meaning flights land dead on time.

In future, if there is a risk of a jam, UK air traffic controllers will alert aircraft up to 350 miles away and tell them to reduce their speed so they arrive to land at a precise time.
NATS is working with air traffic controllers in Ireland, France and Holland to control the arrival of planes, and will soon introduce Scandinavian controllers to the system as well.
A plane flies over Heathrow. Experts say the system would work particularly well with the proposed new third runway at Heathrow Airport
They hope to extend the 350-mile range to 550 miles and then to 1,000 miles.
The result should be that flights will arrive more reliably without delays, fly at a higher altitude, waste less fuel and make less noise over homes, meaning an end to holding, or stacking as it is also known.
Mr Rolfe told the RunwaysUK aviation conference in London: Airlines can expect reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.
Getting rid of the holds means well be able to depart modern, efficient, capable aircraft into more efficient higher airspace more quickly  which in turn will help reduce the noise footprint on the ground and the wider environmental impact.
NATS general manager Paul Haskins added: Think of it like the M25 variable speed limit system in the sky.
Just like with the M25s system, slowing down the traffic means you dont get bunching, the flights fly more smoothly, and you dont have planes flying into the back of a traffic jam.
We developed it for UK airspace but are extending it across Europe  first at a range of 350 miles, then 550 miles and ultimately 1,000 miles.
An air traffic controller in the UK can use an electronic tool to tell a plane 350 miles away to slow down so that they arrive at their landing slot when it is clear. It is like giving it a precise appointment.
Mr Rolfe said the system would work particularly well with the proposed new third runway at Heathrow Airport as aircraft become more sophisticated and numerous.
Lets be clear, a new runway will mean new routes and changes to existing routes, and we know that isnt easy, he said.
Traffic levels are expected to increase significantly from todays level until the new runway is operational, and will increase further.

Rocking it: On Instagram, Loey shows off many pieces in her closet - including several two-piece swimsuits
Every body is beautiful: The beauty and fashion vlogger says that people tell her that fat girls don't look good in bikinis - but she begs to differ, and notes that everyone has different tastes
Body-positive: Loey (pictured with her husband) says it's 'bull' to claim that fat girls showing so much skin makes you 'uncomfortable', since the same isn't said about thin girls
'The second thing I'm told a lot is that it makes people uncomfortable... seeing this much skin on a bigger woman makes someone else uncomfortable,' she continued.
Her response to this objection is that one person shouldn't be able to tell another what she can or cannot wear based on their own preferences.
In addition, it seems unreasonable to Loey that only 'fat' women showing skin causes this discomfort.
Thin women are not told to stop wearing whatever they're wearing because it makes someone else uncomfortable.
'Other body types are not told this,' she says. 'Thin women are not told to stop wearing whatever they're wearing because it makes someone else uncomfortable. So I'm gonna call bull on that.
'The third [objection] is that we are promoting obesity. So someone who's plus-size, fat, curvy - whatever you want to call it - if they are in less clothing, we are promoting obesity,' she says with air quotes before adding sarcastically: 'Anyone who is fat and not completely miserable is promoting obesity, by the way.'
Loey is by no means 'promoting obesity', she says. When she wears her bikinis on the beach, she is neither 'shoving her face full of junk food' nor 'screaming at the top of her lungs' that other people should be overweight, too.
She is usually just minding her own business. But that doesn't stop strangers from saying things to her like 'Yo, fatty, lay off the hamburgers'. When she is eating fruit, they'll say things like: 'Oh my god, look at her pretending to be healthy.'
Who asked you? The blonde beauty had been verbally attacked by strangers, who have made mean comments to her at the beach; when she eats fruit, they say things like: 'Look at her pretending to be healthy'
No agenda: Another concern Loey often hears is that heavy girls who show skin are 'promoting obesity'
Do your own thing: Loey criticizes those who take time out of their day to make someone else feel bad with unsolicited vitriol
The final comment she's received regarding her penchant for baring her body 'really, really, really bother me,' she said.
When larger women show skin, Loey said, 'I get told a lot that we're asking for feedback. So that's to justify someone else saying to me, "Hey, that swimsuit looks like shit on you, go work out."'
She explains that this kind of comment is 'genuinely scary' to her. No one is looking for a stranger's approval, she argues.
Even if these plus-size people are sharing images on social media, it's likely because they think 'they look bomb in it', so to tell them otherwise is just cruel.
'That is such a bad and negative thing to do,' Zoey lectures, 'and to waste all of your precious time living such a negative life or having such a crappy outlook, to think that someone else really cares about your opinion... it's scary, it's egotistical, and you mightwant to reevaluate things.'
She then wraps up the body-positive message with a sarcastic revelation that - surprise - none of the objections she listed are credible.
'You know, now, going over this list, I don't really think any of these excuses are valid,' she concludes. 'So does that mean we get to continue wearing what we want?'

Operation Purple Barracuda was a joint sting between South Wales Police and various partners including the National Crime Agency, Cardiff Council and British Transport Police.
It's part of a wider project - Operation Fulcrum - which is a crackdown on drugs trafficking, sex offenders and illegal drivers by police.
Chief Superintendent Belinda Davies said the operation had been a 'complex and sensitive' investigation.
She said: 'Yesterday's police action represents the latest phase of Operation Fulcrum  South Wales Police's commitment to keeping communities across Cardiff safe from organised crime.

'During the course of the operation, 20 people were arrested for an array of offences, including suspected forced labour, money laundering, theft and the large scale abstraction of electricity.
'Suspected proceeds of crime ranging from luxury cars, including a Ferrari and Range Rover, were seized along with a very substantial quantity of cash.
'One of the most critical elements of yesterday's operation, however, was our commitment to protecting British and foreign nationals from suspected forced labour and poor working conditions.'
She added that she hoped the operation would reassure members of the public that the police was committed to tackling organised crime and other forms of criminality in the Welsh capital.
Inspector James Dyson said the swoop was the result of several months of planning and research.
He added: 'To ensure the operation addressed all aspects of criminality, advice was sought from other law enforcement agencies - including the National Crime Agency.

'A police response such as this will no doubt have an impact on the traveller community within Cardiff and beyond.
'With a view to this, there is an ongoing engagement process with Cardiff Council and the traveller community.
'The policing response was designed to reassure (people) that South Wales Police are there to represent and serve all, and will address any criminality and anti-social behaviour that exists.'
The area's MP Stephen Doughty said: 'I've been in touch with South Wales Police over the past 24 hours regarding these raids.
'These allegations of human trafficking and forced labour are shocking revelations.

'It is vital that the police are able to gather relevant evidence and I would strongly encourage anyone with information to come forward and help the police.'
Mr Doughty, Labour MP for Cardiff South and Penarth, added: 'There have been a number of revelations of forced labour in Wales and throughout Britain and it is crucial that this barbaric form of modern slavery is dealt with severely.
'It is important that the unfortunate individuals involved are released from these conditions and brought to safety.'

La Compagnie
The all-business class airline, which runs a regular service between Paris and New York and London and New York, is as well known for its stylish uniforms as it is for its unparalleled service.
With a nod to the company's French origins, La Compagnie enlisted the help of Parisian fashion house Vicomte A to design the in-flight styles.

Female crew don chic, yet practical culottes and a Celeste blue silk scarf, while the smart male stewards are clad in a three-piece suit and blue knitted tie.
It's far less formal than one might expect from such an airline - not that we're complaining.
Aeroflot
The Russian national carrier's eye-catching uniforms are as noteworthy for their retro blazers and tilted caps as they are for their bold orange hue.
In 2010, the new uniform was created by Julia Bunakova and Evgeny Khokhlov, two prominent local designers from St. Petersburg.
While the women's uniform comes in a chic dark blue colour, as well, specifically for the winter months - it's their red tangerine summer offering that tops our best-dressed flight crew list.

We're not the only ones who think so.
In 2013, the Aeroflot cabin uniform was voted to be the most stylish in Europe in a survey organised by global travel search site, Skyscanner.
And with white gloves and neckties that hark back to the golden age of flying, passengers just might feel as though they've transported back to the swinging Sixties when they step on board.
Emirates
Emirates is home to some of the most sophisticated uniforms in the business.
But instead of sourcing out the designs to an internationally renowned fashion house, the airline decided to employ British designer Simon Jersey, a longtime leader in corporate clothing.
First introduced in 2009 - and using colours and fabrics that mirror the elegance of the brand - the new uniforms simply improve upon the look and comfort of yesteryear's designs.

For men, a rich chocolate coloured suit with a subtle cream and red pinstripe was chosen. Women, on the other hand, wear an elegant mushroom coloured suit with a matching chocolate and red pinstripe pattern.
A cream blouse is worn by both cabin crew and pursers and an inverted pleat on the skirts offer a flash of red when the female flight attendants walk by.
But its the headwear - the signature red hat and white scarf - that is the crew's best accessory, also offering a nod to the Dubai-based brand's culture and history.
Air France
Crafted by Christian Lacroix, Air France's uniforms have long been considered to be one of the most unique in the air.
With a long history of working with top designers, the airline has previously contracted Balenciaga and Dior in the 1960s.
However, the latest Air France incarnation, which was introduced in 2005, may be the best yet, asLacroix's now-signature red gloves and sculptural red bow-tie belts perfectly accent the navy blue theme colour.

Rather than help, his friends stood laughing as Mr Sayers spent 10 minutes struggling in vain to wrestle his head free.
They eventually took sympathy on the father-of-two and he was  rescued to cheers from the crowd after having his head greased in Vaseline.
Mr Sayers, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, told MailOnline: 'I'd had about 12 or 13 cans over about eight hours and was in a bit of a silly mood.
'Throughout the day I'd been throwing my clubs round, because that's what I often end up doing, and a couple of them were bent so at the end I said "right, these are going in the bin".

Stuck: Mr Sayers, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, said: 'Everybody was in hysterics. I've got my wife and kids there - and my mother - and they're all laughing their heads off at my stupid predicament'
'But when they wouldn't fit everybody started laughing so I thought, right, I'm going to stick my head in there instead, that'll get a laugh.
'So I shoved my head in the bin. It wouldn't go in at first and then as I gave it a big push and forced it I knew straight away I was in trouble. I tried to pull it out again but my ears got stuck.
'Well then everybody was in hysterics. I've got my wife and kids there - and my mother - and they're all laughing their heads off at my stupid predicament.' 
He added: 'I was stuck like that for about 10 minutes until someone who had been carrying Vaseline to avoid sores during the golf day helped get my head out.
The 49-year-old, who said he's 'a bit silly anyway', admitted to having had a few beers before he got stuck
Receiving assistance: His friends did eventually try to help free him from his predicament.During the video one onlooker can be heard saying: 'We've had a hole in one. He was after that Strongbow'
Mr Sayers, who is married to Alison, 45, and has two children Daniel, 17, and Jake, 14, said he had been getting stick for the prank ever since
'He rubbed it on my temples and behind my ears and I was able to get one ear out then the rest of my head.
'It did hurt a bit, but I was OK. I had some bruises on my neck but the wasps left me alone, luckily.'
Mr Sayers, who is married to Alison, 45, and has two children Daniel, 17, and Jake, 14, said he had been getting stick for the prank ever since.

Lorraine, 62, of Kidsgrove Staffordshire, was referred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for a successful bone marrow transplant in 2005.
Her cancer returned 12 months later but the day-care co-ordinator for Approach is now in remission.
The 24-hour session, which ran from 6pm on June 4 until 6pm the following day was attended by around 200 spectators.
The group used flashing golf balls to keep the rounds going throughout the night.

	Based in Pool, Cornwall, it opened today and features a 100-seat restaurant, a gluten-free bakery, a state-of-the-art baker-training facility and the first ever pasty drive-thru.

She said: 'The drive- thru is important - because I don't like queuing.
'I was on my own with my children for a while and I found that I'd have to get out of the car, one of them would have dozed off and I couldn't get a loaf of bread.
'Sometimes I'd think - I need milk and you can't just leave your kids in the car - so, from our drive-thru, you'll be able to get a loaf of bread - and of course a pasty.
'The plans have been in the pipeline for 18 months and I am buzzing.'
She is now hoping to use the new site to export her pasties around the world, as well as selling other bakery products to locals.
She said: 'It's the perfect place for what I'd like to achieve for Cornwall and my business.
'Once you get the craving to bake it's in your blood. But you have to love it because it's a really hard job.'
Malcolm Bell from tourism group Visit Cornwall said: 'It's a great idea. We've been walking in and out of pasty shops for ages to get basically the world's best and earliest fast food.
'It's great to have a drive-thru which draws attention to the great pasty and great to have it in Redruth which is obviously one of the hearts of mining history.
'Anything that gives profile to Cornwall and gets it talked about helps us massively.'

	George Osborne urged to use first Tory budget to slash the 45p top rate of tax

	Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said the 45p rate should be abolished altogether – claiming it would attract business to Britain and cost the Exchequer little in lost revenues.

In the run up to the election, the Prime Minister repeatedly refused to rule out scrapping the higher rate.
He said cutting the top rate of tax was not in his 'plan', but refused to rule it out.
According to the Financial Times, Mr Osborne has 'indicated in Treasury meetings that he might cut the 45p tax rate on earnings above 150,000'.
Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson said the 45p rate should be abolished altogether
But Lord Lawson has urged Mr Osborne to make the move. The Tory peer said he would 'strongly support' any cut, adding that it would 'significantly enhance the attractiveness of the UK as a place to do business, at no cost in terms of lost revenue'.
He told the Financial Times: 'That was the experience when I brought the top rate down to 40 per cent in 1988 and it is even more relevant today.'
The move would be welcomed in the City of London, where banks have complained about high taxes.
Labour increased the rate from 40p to 50p in 2009 after the financial crash, and Mr Osborne cut it to 45p in his 2012 Budget.
The Conservatives have already promised to cut pension tax relief for the highest earners and Mr Osborne is also expected to announce a 5billion crackdown on tax avoidance.
He will also use the Budget to raise the income tax threshold for those on low earnings and to make progress towards a 50,000 starting rate for the current 40p rate.
When the former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling announced plans to introduce a 50p income tax rate on incomes above 150,000 from 2010-11, it was originally estimated to increase tax revenues by 2.7 billion a year.
But Mr Osborne commissioned HMRC to analyse the 2010-11 tax returns to assess how much extra tax had actually been raised. It estimated that the 50p rate brought in 1bn more than the 40p rate.
Cutting the rate back to 45p was estimated to cost 100m, suggesting that reducing it to 40p would cost at least 900,000.
The estimates of the cost of reducing the top tax rate are subject to large margins of errors.

	Cambridge University researchers found 33 per cent of British women admitted to drinking the equivalent of two-thirds of a bottle of wine in a single sitting – at least once during their pregnancy.

They found that 75 per cent of women in Britain had drunk alcohol at some point during pregnancy, compared to 82 per cent in Ireland, 56 per cent in New Zealand and 40 per cent in Australia. Some 33 per cent of British women admitted to bingeing  defined as six units, or three large glasses of wine, at a time  compared to 59 per cent of Irish women, 10 per cent of Australians and 9 per cent of New Zealanders.
The researchers called for a simplified code in which women are advised not to drink at all while pregnant. Since most women who consume alcohol do so at lower levels where the offspring growth and development effects are less well understood, the widespread consumption of even low levels of alcohol during pregnancy is a significant public health concern, they added.
Last month, Professor Sir Al Aynsley Green, president elect of the British Medical Association, criticised the contradictory and inconsistent advice given to women, and said: It has to be concluded that there is no safe limit for alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
Currently the Government warns that all pregnant women should avoid alcohol, but says that if they do drink, they should stick to one or two units once or twice a week.
Meanwhile the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) says that women should abstain from all alcohol in the first three months of pregnancy, after which point there is no evidence that drinking under three units twice a week will do any harm.
Responding to the Cambridge study, Clare Murphy, from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, called for reassurance for women, adding: The majority of women in the UK are drinking well within the existing recommendations in the second trimester.

FOUR STEPS TO HALVE RISK OF HEART FAILURE
Making just four healthy changes to your lifestyle, including keeping active, watching your weight and drinking only in moderation halves your risk of suffering heart failure in later life, research shows.
Experts tracked 4,490 men and women aged 65 and over for two decades, and found that those who broadly followed public health advice were healthiest.
Scientists from Tufts University in Massachusetts monitored participants diets, walking habits, leisure activities, exercise intensity, drinking, smoking, weight, height and waist circumference, then linked the different lifestyle traits to their health.
During the study, 1,380 participants suffered heart failure. But the data, published in the American College of Cardiology journal Heart Failure, suggested that those who adopted four or more of the healthy behaviours studied were half as likely to have heart failure as those who lived unhealthy lifestyles.

	Iain Duncan Smith says he welcomes food banks

	The Work and Pensions Secretary said the rise in the number of charities handing out food parcels was evidence of 'decent' people helping those who have 'fallen into difficulty'.

The government boasted that poverty levels remained at the lowest level since the 1980s.
But in the Commons,Labour MP David Winnick said: 'If the situation has improved substantially why has there been such a large amount of food banks, far larger than previously?
'Isn't it quite clear that some Tory members have no idea at all of the amount of poverty which exists, in many cases in their own constituencies?'
Earlier the SNP's Ian Blackford said: 'Is it not a disgrace that in my own constituency the biggest increase in food bank use has come from those who are in work?'
I welcome decent people in society trying to help others who may, for various reasons, have fallen into difficulty
Iain Duncan Smith
Mr Duncan Smith said he had no problem with the increased use of food banks: 'Most of my colleagues are usually involved with food banks and actually help them.
'I welcome food banks. I welcome decent people in society trying to help others who may, for various reasons, have fallen into difficulty.
'I don't accept the single cause of that is to do with the welfare reforms, quite the contrary.
'Food bank usage has been rising over a period. It was never part of the British system, but in Germany where their welfare payments you can argue are higher, 1.5 million a week use food banks, much more than they do here.'
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said:'It's small wonder that Iain Duncan Smith is a fan of food banks  his polices are keeping them in business.
'If he spent more time visiting food banks he would see for himself that many users are in work, as well those punished by his cruel sanctions regime. Slashing tax credits for the working poor will only make things worse.'
Senior Conservatives have repeatedly faced criticism for their attitude towards food banks.
But Lord Freud said the rise in demand for food banks was difficult to understand., adding 'it is very hard to know why people go to them'.
Ministers have previously argued that an increase in the number of food banks has been fuelled by Jobcentre staff being allowed to refer the unemployed to food banks for help
Two years ago Cabinet minister Michael Gove was branded an 'absolute disgrace' by Labour after claiming families who use food banks have only their own 'decisions' to blame.
He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.
He added: 'I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures.
'Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances.
If the situation has improved substantially why has there been such a large amount of food banks, far larger than previously?
Labour MP David Winnick
'We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.'
Former Tory chairman Lord Tebbit has also claimed that people who use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, blaming a 'near infinite demand' for anything free.
Last year the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger in the UK found that, since the establishment of the Trussell Trust network in 2004, numbers of emergency food assistance providers have grown to at least 1,500, including 800 food banks - around half of them operated by the Trust.
Its major report, Feeding Britain, found there that 'demand for emergency food assistance is increasing, and sometimes increasing dramatically'.
But Tory peer Baroness Jenkin of Kennington faced criticised after she suggested that a lack of cookery skills was in part to blame for families going to food banks, and boasted she ate a bowl of porridge for 4p for breakfast.

Toms shoes founder Blake Mycoskie has called for all new fathers to receive three months paternity leave.
His comments come after he gave himself 12 weeks off following the birth of his six-month-old son, Summit.
The shoe company entrepreneur offers all new parents at his firm eight weeks paid leave and flexible schedules after they return to work.
Now he wants more businesses across America to support new fathers.
'It's an experience I wish every new dad could have, but I realize how lucky I am,' Mr Mycoskie told Glamour .
'In fact, when I announced I'd be taking leave, some of my CEO peers were mystified.
'Responses ranged from 'You're going to get real bored, real quick' to 'How are you supposed to lead a company while changing diapers?'
According to Mycoskie, just 12 per cent of all workers in America have access to formal paid parental leave and most men take just a week off after the birth of their children.
But the businessman says rather than being a burden on the workplace, bosses should think of it as an investment.
'What may look like a cost on the spread sheets, actually is an investment in higher productivity and more engagement,' he told the Today Show .

	Spearfisher Valentine Thomas reveals the abuse she receives for the sport she loves

	In her spare time, City worker Valentine Thomas (pictured), 28, who moved from Canada to London five years ago, swaps a suit for a snorkel and travels the world in search of another big catch.

'People call me a killer,' Miss Thomas told MailOnline. 'I face sexism, I face a lot of hate, but I have also had marriage proposals.'
In 2010, the French-speaking Canadian moved from Montreal to the UK, and was persuaded by a friend to complete a diving course in Egypt.
She then travelled to the remote Ascension Island in the south Atlantic for her first trip and soon fell in love with the sport.
'For me to be able to grab my own food is amazing,' the keen cook explained. 'I like everything - even cleaning the fish afterwards. We are really involved in sea preservation. We never kill anything we won't eat.'
Amazing: Valentine Thomas encounters huge whale shark
Backlash: Valentine is a successful sportswoman who became a record holder in 2013 on Ascension Island
Haul: The keen cook has been criticised for spearfishing but insists she never kills anything she doesn't eat
World record: Valentine pictured with the huge Atlantic Jack which made her a world record holder in 2013
Criticism: Valentine documents her travels on social media but has faced strong backlash with some calling her a killer
It was on her first fishing expedition that Miss Thomas almost died when she became separated from her partner in high waves.
'I started freaking out,' she said. 'I was trying to swim to the shore and I couldn't.
Sometimes you can be five miles from the shore. When you spear a fish and there is blood everywhere, the sharks are around
'Sometimes you can be five miles from the shore. When you spear a fish and there is blood everywhere, the sharks are around.'
Miss Thomas, who works in the City raising capital for a hedge fund, was lucky on this occasion and found a rope connected to her partner so she could pull herself to safety.
She has travelled to the island in the Atlantic on numerous occasions to indulge her passion, as well as to Durban in South Africa where she swam into a school of between 20 and 30 sharks, Corsica and Greece.
She has also fished off the Channel Islands, Dorset and Cornwall.
In 2013, she broke the  world record for catching the largest Atlantic Jack while diving off Ascension Island.
As a woman taking part in a male-dominated sport, Miss Thomas benefits from free equipment from sponsors and trip invites, but she is also bombarded with abuse.
Hobby: The 28-year-old went to Ascension Island for her first spearfishing trip four years ago but almost died
Deadly: Risks Valentine faces are strong currents and sharks, like this one spotted while she was fishing in South Africa
Future: The world-record holder, who works in the City, hopes to make spearfishing her full-time occupation
Next trip: The sportswoman will be travelling to Zanzibar for two weeks in the summer where she hopes to bag a new world record
Travel: Fishing has allowed her to travel to exotic locations around the world. This photo was taken in Corsica
One of her pictures was recently shared on an Instagram account called Spear Sluts - a page featuring beautiful, bikini-clad women fishing.
Some question whether she actually catches the fish she poses with, suggesting her boyfriend is responsible.
'It's extremely rare to see women, actually,' she said. 'It's really something quite different. It used to bother me - it definitely bothers my boyfriend. People don't believe I can do things like this.'
She concedes: 'It's the good and the bad publicity. I don't think I have ever bought any equipment.'
And Miss Thomas is often called a killer on social media, but she insists her way of fishing is far more humane that using a net.
Some pictures show her gutting her catches - prompting critics to call on her to stop. One  described her on Facebook as Jack the Ripper.
'I shoot them in the brain and they die immediately,' she said. 'I'm very respectful of everything I do.
'If you buy fish from a supermarket, why am I the bad guy? People see blood and they get squeamish.
'People get really angry, they get  upset because they are not used to seeing where their food comes from. Everyone turns a blind eye to what they are eating and I put the reality in front of them.'
Humane: Valentine, 28, insists the way she kills the fish is far more humane than catching them in a net
Getting her hands dirty: The 28-year-old not only kills fish but guts, cleans and cooks her catches before eating them
Doubt: Some question whether she catches the fish she poses with, suggesting her boyfriend is responsible
Miss Thomas believes she got her adventurous streak from her father, Alain, who sailed across the Atlantic when he was in his 20s.
He taught her to dive and fish when she was a child, but she had to overcome her fears to pursue her passion.
Now it's getting harder and harder to go back to the office on Monday and go on the computer
'It took me quite a while before being comfortable with shore diving,' Miss Thomas wrote on social media.
'I almost drowned in the south west of France when I was a teenager after being caught in an underwater current.
'Spearfishing allowed me to overcome my fear of the ocean which got replaced with passion, but it was a long road to get there.'
In July, she will visit Zanzibar off the east coast of Africa for two weeks where she hopes to bag a new world record.
She has already featured in two French television documentaries about fishing but has far bigger ambitions.
'My dream would be to make a TV show so I can fish for a living and I would like to get involved in protecting the ocean,' she said.'Now it's getting harder and harder to go back to the office on Monday and go on the computer.'

	ITV's News At Ten to replace Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham with Tom Bradby

	Tom Bradby, currently the channel's political editor, was today revealed as the new presenter of the flagship primetime news programme.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
A source told The Sun there was 'mutiny in the ranks' over the changes, adding: 'Colleagues are either Team Mark or Team Tom. Some don't understand why a change is necessary.'
Earlier this month, another insider told the Guardian: 'If it ain't broke why fix it?'
Disgruntled: Current presenters Mark Austin and Julie Etchingham are said to be unhappy at the move
However, Mr Bradby has apparently been singled out as the 'future face of news' for ITV - a source recently told the Daily Mail he would be 'our new Trevor McDonald'.
The experienced journalist was the first person to interview Prince William and Kate Middleton after they got engaged in 2010, on the specific request of the Prince.
It was Mr Bradby who sparked the News of the World phone-hacking scandal in 2005, when he told police that a reporter had listened in on messages exchanged between him and William.
More recently, he became an unlikely hate figure in the US when American Twitter users confused him with top NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who has been suspended for misconduct.
Legacy: News at Ten was previously hosted by Sir Trevor MacDonald, pictured on screen in 2000
Mr Bradby said in a statement today: 'News at Ten is one of the best known and loved news brands in the country and I have hugely enjoyed working for it in 25 years on the road with ITV News.
'The chance to help lead it into a new era is a unique and incredibly exciting challenge - and, given the programme's heritage, a great honour, too.'
Michael Jermey, ITV's Director of News and Current Affairs, added: 'ITV News is fortunate to have an exceptionally talented line-up of experienced and knowledgeable newscasters. They bring vast reporting and presenting experience to our programmes and their journalism enhances all our news output.
'I'm delighted Tom is joining our very strong and well established presenting line-up. His expert knowledge of British politics and international affairs will be very valuable as we develop News at Ten.'
WAR REPORTER, ROYAL EXPERT, POLITICAL STAR... NOW THE FACE OF ITV
Tom Bradby is poised to become the public face of ITV after a storied career as a war correspondent, royal reporter and now political specialist.
The 48-year-old was born in Malta while his father was serving as an officer in the Royal Navy, and was educated at Sherborne School, alma mater to Coldplay's Chris Martin and actor Jeremy Irons.
After studying at Edinburgh University, he joined ITN as a graduate trainee 1990 - and 25 years later, he has still never worked anywhere else.
Mr Bradby spent three years as Ireland correspondent, then moved his young family to Hong Kong as ITV's Asia correspondent - almost costing him his leg when he was shot during a protest in Indonesia.
Friends: Mr Bradby was the first person to interview Prince William and Kate Middleton together
In 2001, he reluctantly accepted the job of royal correspondent because it was the only post available in London - but he soon developed a reputation as one of the closest confidants to the next generation of royals.
After accompanying Prince Harry on his gap year in Lesotho, he struck up a friendship with Prince William, and was the first person to interview William and Kate Middleton when they got engaged.
He also found himself dragged in to what would become the phone hacking scandal, when it emerged that a News of the World journalist had intercepted voicemail messages between him and the prince.
Mr Bradby was appointed political editor in 2005, despite not having a political background - which he claims is an advantage because neither side can accuse him of bias.
He is host of the political chat show The Agenda, and last month was the lead anchor on ITV's coverage of the General Election.
Now the presenter - who has three children with his wife Claudia - is likely to become one of the most prominent journalists in the country if, as predicted, he takes over News at Ten.

	Police attend Bradford after Facebook post calling the niqab offensive is shared

	A photo of three women in niqabs with the message ‘share if you find this offensive’ was seen on the Facebook page of a member of a Bradford's school’s support staff and reported.

The Facebook post originated from Britain First  the right wing political movement reportedly founded by a former member of the British Nationalist Party  and was allegedly shared by Angie Dunn, a non-teaching member of staff at the Bradford comprehensive.
However, police are also looking into a complaint from Ms Dunn that her Facebook account was maliciously hacked.
The secondary school has around 1,000 pupils aged from 11 to 18.
Response: The headteacher has maintained that calling the police in over the alleged anti-niqab post was the right thing to do
According to a recent Ofsted report the vast majority of students are from minority ethnic backgrounds and speak English as an additional language.
When news of the anti-Islamic social media photo spread through the school it clearly provoked anger amongst pupils and parents demanding action.
Mrs McIntosh, the headteacher, said: We have dealt with this matter swiftly and informed the police right away. It will now be investigated in the proper way and will be dealt with accordingly.
We will not allow any isolated incident to distract from our focus on delivering a high quality education to all our students, as a welcoming, inclusive and supportive environment for the whole community.
In a letter to parents, she added: You may be aware of the tasteless and offensive Facebook post regarding the hijab allegedly posted by a member of staff.
This appalling action in no way represents the thoughts, feelings or actions of Laisterdyke Business and Enterprise College and the 207 other individuals who work here.
Prejudice and racism in any form is not acceptable in or out of our college and any such behaviour is taken very seriously. That is why the matter has been reported to the police for investigation as a hate crime.
A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said they were contacted on Wednesday morning by a member of staff at the school about an inappropriate picture which had been shared on their social media page. He said: Enquiries are continuing into this matter.
Councillor Mohammed Shafiq said he had ten calls in an hour from worried parents.
He said: Im pleased that the school has launched a full investigation to look into this matter and the priority remains the education of our children.
While Brian Morris, a local UKIP councillor, warned of an overreaction.
He said: It's the times we live in unfortunately. No matter how the post was meant to be seen, people will take it as offensive even if that wasn't the intention.
There are people out there looking for problems and the slightest little thing they can get hold of they will. People will twist things and make a bigger issue out of it.
Councillor Susan Hinchclifffe, Bradford Councils executive member for schools, said the authority would not tolerate any instance of prejudice, in any shape or form.
It is not known if any action has been taken against Ms Dunn, a member of the learning support staff.
Laisterdyke hit the headlines in April last year when the governors were removed following a critical Ofsted report and concerns raised by the council. They were accused of undermining the head and interfering in the day-to-day running of the school.
It was revealed how teachers had previously been suspended after clashing with governors who wanted to model the school on the academy in Birmingham at the centre of the 'Trojan Horse' allegations.

Defence:West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes says the force has come a long way since the report was written
Half of all victims, who were from Birmingham, Dudley and Walsall, lived with their parents, while 41 per cent were in care.
Police pin-pointed 75 grooming suspects - most with a history of sexual violence - with most being from a Muslim background from Birmingham.
The report stated: 'The vast majority of identified suspects (79 per cent) are Asian (59 of 75), 12 per cent are white and five per cent are African Caribbean. 62 per cent of Asian suspects are of Pakistani origin.
'Pakistani males account for half of all identified suspects in the force (37 of 75).
'Offenders are likely to have a history of previous sexual offences, as well as a wide range of other offences and convictions.
'A high level of organised criminality has now been evidenced both across the force area and regionally, with multiple offenders working together to identify, groom and abuse victims.
'In a number of organised groups victims are forced into prostitution and high levels of intimidation and force are used to keep the victims compliant.'
Concerns: The report speaks of an upcoming English Defence League march through Dudley a month later, which saw streets emptied and shops boarded up
The shocking document also highlighted fears of 'community tensions' if the police made the report's findings public.
HOW WEST MIDLANDS REPORT HAS SHADES OF ROTHERHAM SCANDAL
West Midlands Police's decision to withhold details of alleged child abuse amid fears of increasing racial tensions has shades of the scandal in Rotherham.
Police and social workers in the South Yorkshire town were accused of being too concerned about being labelled racist to speak out about the crimes involving 1,400 children.
Yesterday it emerged that the massive inquiry into the Rotherham sex abuse scandal could run until at least 2018 and has so far identified 300 suspects.
Investigators say the number of possible offenders is changing on a daily basis and they suspect thousands of offences have been committed.
The team has seized 92 boxes containing several thousand files and identified more than 3,300 lines of inquiry. The suspects are predominantly Asian men from the South Yorkshire town and include two who have worked for the council. Their victims are mainly white, British, underage and vulnerable girls.
Operation Stovewood is currently costing up to 5million every year, and is still likely to be ongoing in three years time  putting the total bill for the inquiry at around 15million.
So far the inquiry has backed an original estimate that 1,400 girls were abused in Rotherham during a 16-year period from 1997 to 2013.
Last night childrens charities demanded that the men should be brought to justice.
Barnardos chief executive Javed Khan said: Because so many vulnerable children were ignored by the authorities, groomers got away with exploiting them for years.
Ensuring the cases against groomers go to trial is vital in giving sexually exploited children confidence that the justice system does work for them; that if they come forward, they will be believed and supported'.
It stated: 'The predominant offender profile of Pakistani Muslim males... combined with the predominant victim profile of white females has the potential to cause significant community tensions.
'There is a potential for a backlash against the vast majority of law abiding citizens from Asian/Pakistani communities from other members of the community believing their children have been exploited.
'These factors, combined with an EDL protest in Dudley in April and a General Election in May could notably increase community tension.
'Police will be criticised if it appears we have not safeguarded vulnerable children, investigated offences and prosecuted offenders.'
The lengthy report concluded authorities in the West Midlands needed to improve its care of missing care home children.
It stated: 'There is strong evidence in the vast majority of all cases that the victims are enticed, stupefied or controlled by alcohol and a mixture of controlled drugs.
'The victims are already suffering from health conditions relating to their chaotic lifestyle and exploitation (Pregnancy, termination, STDs, neglect, and physical and psychological problems).'
West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said: 'These reports, spanning six years, give a real insight into the journey we have undertaken along with our partners into investigating and tackling child sexual exploitation.
'There is no doubt that there has been a significant cultural change within the force in respect of this issue and it is now very clear that the responsibility of tackling CSE (child sexual exploitation) lies with every police officer, staff member, PCSO and special constable.
'The force has carried out extensive work to train officers across the force in how to identify and deal with CSE so we can gain as much intelligence as possible and thereby improving the outcomes for victims.
'We continue to take great steps and as a result of our efforts and without doubt the coverage within local and national media, we are seeing more victims coming forward to report abuse, knowing we will take their allegations seriously and treat them sensitively and respectfully.'

'We owe Vince a huge debt of gratitude, what he did was priceless and he did it without a second thought. We can't thank him enough.
'It might seem like only a small thing but people are reluctant to help strangers out now.'
Mr Lofus and Mr Bolam were driving their van back from a job in Liverpool when Mr Lofus began feeling ill.
'Usually Tom has his medication with him but we'd left in such a rush he had forgotten it,' said Mr Bolam. 'Then the heat of the day had taken its toll on him too and was making it worse.
We owe Vince a huge debt of gratitude, what he did was priceless and he did it without a second thought. We can't thank him enough. It might seem like only a small thing but people are reluctant to help strangers out now
'We thought if we got him home he would be fine but once we were stuck in traffic he really took a funny turn and we knew it was serious.'
Mr Brown had been stuck on the stretch of road for two hours when he spotted Mr Lofus in distress.
Since the traffic was at a standstill, he got out of his van to see if he could help.
He offered Mr Lofus two cereal bars and a Cadbury's Brunch chocolate bar that he had brought along for himself. Moments later, he returned and gave Mr Lofus three bottles of water.
Mr Bolam, who lives in Bury, Greater Manchester, said: 'What impressed us most is that Vince wasn't looking for praise or thanks, he just did it out of the goodness of his heart.
'He is obviously just the kind of guy who is happy to help out where he can - and we really needed it in this instance, or who knows what might have happened to Tom.'
In recognition of Mr Brown's kindness, Mr Bolam uploaded a post about his actions to Facebook. It has now been shared more than 21,000 times and has more than 45,000 'likes'.
Mr Brown said: 'I've been completely overwhelmed by the response. I don't consider it a big act of kindness, it's just something I would do for anyone really.
Internet sensation:In recognition of Mr Brown's kindness, Mr Bolam uploaded a post about his actions to Facebook. It has now been shared more than 21,000 times and has more than 45,000 'likes'
'I have stopped my van before when I've seen people broken down and offered them a drink or an apple and so on in case they have been stranded a while.
'I think it's important to offer help when you can.'
The driver, who recently celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary, has worked for DHL driving exclusively for Iceland for 15 years.
Nick Canning, Joint Managing Director at Iceland said: 'We pride ourselves on providing an excellent service - wherever we are!
'And this is exactly the kind of upstanding behaviour we encourage from any member of the Iceland family. We want to congratulate Vince for being such a hero.'
After seeing the post online, a number of social media users shared their memories of Mr Brown being kind and helping them.
Julie Williams said: 'Vince is a lovely man, l remember him from when l worked at Iceland, and this doesn't surprise me.'
Jody Bate said: 'He's a dude. Always make him a hot drink when he calls at our store and he's always ready to chat and willing to help. Good on ya Vince.'
Sirah Younis said: 'I've only met this driver a couple of times when he delivered to our store and he was really nice! Well done to him!'
Paul Bayliss said: 'Vince is a true hero, his act of kindness restorers our faith in todays society. He is a credit and shines as an exampled to all of us that there are kind people out there. Vince we salute you and wish you many years of happiness as you deserve the best in life.'
Gaynor Longmire said: 'Vince is a great fella, and it always a pleasure to see him when he delivers to our shop...a true gentleman with a heart of gold.'

Speaking at the palace on Thursday, James revealed that his ultimate royal appearance would come from Prince Harry, but then again any royal appearance would be a dream come true.
'I can absolutely say that any member of the royal family,' he joked. 'Should they wish to, the invitation will always be there to do a Carpool Karaoke.'
'I don't imagine they'll take me up on it, but should they ever wish they are all welcome, yes.'

At the time that James' accolade was announced he joked that his mother was already fretting about her outfit, saying: 'My family are very proud. My mum is already fretting about what to wear.'
But it looked like faithful partner Julia didn't have any trouble picking out the right thing and looked elegant in black and white.
She wore black patent heels to set off an a-line dress with lily floral detail, a clutch bag in her hand just rested by her side.
Also being honoured on the day was television presenter Esther, bold in deep red, who was being made a Dame.
What an honour: Corden was delivered the honour by the Princess Royal, who he shook hands with

Matching manicure: She held up the honour with a matching manicure on her fingertips

        <MainBody>Groom's heartwarming reaction as bride walks down aisle
Curled up: Two women huddle together for warmth as they sleep in the doorway on Grosvenor Place in central London
Packing up: In a matter of minutes the migrants can fold away their entire lives, ready for another day on the streets of the capital
A new day: Two rough sleepers stand in a doorway. It is estimated that some 40 per cent of London's homeless population are migrants
Homeless: One man curls up in front of one of the luxury addresses on Grosvenor Place in central London
Belongings: A group of people sleep beneath colourful blankets in one of the doorways - scraps of food on the ledge next to them
A spokesperson for Westminster City Council said: 'As this is private land, the council has no power to move people on but we will work with the leaseholders to support and advise them on a suitable resolution.
'We take the issue very seriously and commission outreach teams in the area to ensure the welfare and safety of those in genuine need of help.
'We work hard with the Police and Immigration Services to address any area where groups are involved in anti-social behaviour.'
The most recent photographs of the migrants have emerged as European leaders gather in Belgium to discuss the growing crisis facing the continent.
The 28 member states have faced a recent influx of illegal immigrants so desperate to live in Europe that they are risking their lives on dangerous road journeys and crossings of the Mediterranean.
And it comes just weeks after another group of migrants was pictured sleeping rough at Marble Arch. More than 70 migrants are now said to be sleeping rough in the area - with some of them, believed to be Eastern Europeans.
Owners of nearby businesses have said not enough is being done to tackle the problem of migrants sleeping rough, some of whom have been living in the area for two years.
Westminster City Council has in the past campaigned to remove migrants from the area - at one point even buying them tickets home - but said earlier this month it needs tougher powers to enforce their removal.
TACKLING HOMELESSNESS ON THE STREET OF LONDON
All local authorities in the UK have been given a target to reduce people sleeping rough in the community.
Councils work alongside teams from outreach groups, the Metropolitan Police and, in the case of migrant rough sleepers, Home Office Immigration Enforcement, to assess the needs of rough sleepers and help provide them with accommodation.
Outreach teams and other services work to help rough sleepers into a range of accommodation types, most commonly hostels but also the private rented sector and residential treatment centres.
Services also help people to reconnect to their home area or country, where they are more likely to find a solution to their homelessness, for example through appropriate support networks, entitlement to accommodation or access to an alcohol treatment centre.
Last year, the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals would face deportation under an EU law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient.
Westminster Council has previously held high-level talks with Home Office officials about the issue, after the number of Romanian rough sleepers in Central London jumping from 20 in January to 59 in May 2014.
Cramped: A man reaches out and stretches before packing up his belongings into the carrier bags strewn on the doorstep around him
Moving on: Hours before the morning commuters arrive on the street, two women drag their pull-along trolleys from their temporary shelter

The court heard that inspectors found the decaying animals in different parts of the house, with used tea bags stacked up against one of the decomposing dogs
Mr McCole said: 'He could smell something rotting when he got to the back door. He pushed the door open to be greeted by an horrific sight.
Horrific: Emma Clarke left ten animals to starve to death, telling the RSPCA that she had re-homed them
Sickening: Clark, 28, left three dogs, two cats, two rabbits, two snakes and a lizard locked in cages with no food or water
'There was no evidence of any water available for any of the severely emaciated animals.
'The defendant's parents were shocked and horrified when the RSPCA spoke to them.
'They had been led to believe the animals had been re-homed at an earlier stage but the evidence showed that wasn't the case.
These animals will have suffered, starving to death in cages, it would have been horrible
RSPCA inspector Sheona Morley
'The animals had died while in the defendant's care and control.
'She had just given up. She returned to the house from time to time but hadn't provided food, sustenance or water for the animals.'
In a police interview, Clark confirmed she was responsible for all the animals but said she'd been having serious family problems and that 'everything just went wrong'.
Addressing the magistrates herself, Clark said: 'I didn't want any of these things to happen.'
Clark, of no fixed abode, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the ten animals over a period of nearly four months. She was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from owning animals for life.
She was also ordered to pay 300 costs and an 80 victim surcharge.
Tragic: Shockingly, some of the pets were thought to have been dead for up to five months by the time they were finally found
Distressing footage played to the court showed RSPCA officers finding the decaying and mummified animals in Clark's former home
Clark was jailed for 18 weeks and banned from keeping animals before leaving the pets to starve to death
Speaking after the hearing, RSPCA inspector Sheona Morley said: 'In my 20 years, this is the most horrific case I've ever been to - it is also the saddest.
'This was a case of horrific cruelty which could have been easily avoided if she had asked for help from her friends and family or tried to re-home her animals.
'It was absolute horror to see all those animals had died from starvation, left in their cages with no access to food or water.
'This is an incredibly sad case, everyone involved is absolutely devastated - these animals will have suffered, starving to death in cages, it would have been horrible.
'Whatever sentence she got nothing is going to undo the suffering caused to those poor animals.
'Nothing can undo what happened to these poor animals. There's no excuse for that kind of cruelty.'

	Immigration and an ageing population have fuelled a boom in the number of people living in the UK, official figures released by the Office for National Statistics revealed this morning.

The population increase over   was fuelled by growing numbers of births over deaths, caused by people living longer, and a surge in migration.
'Natural growth'  of 226,200 accounted for around half the population increase - with net migration of 259,700 making up the rest.
Between mid-2013 and mid-2014, 582,600 migrants arrived in the UK, compared with just 322,900 people leaving the country.
An ONS spokesman said the statistics meant the UK population had grown by almost half a million since mid-2013, up 0.77 per cent to 64,596,800.
Out of the wider UK population, England accounted for 54.3 million, up 0.84 per cent, with the Scottish population hitting 5.3 million - up 0.37 per cent.
Wales's population has grown 0.31 per cent to 3.1 million, with a further 1.8 million living in Northern Ireland.

Tower Hamlets had the largest population increase in the country - increasing 34.5 per cent over just 10 years.
This was because 56,300 people came to the area from overseas and 12,000 left the area to live elsewhere in the UK, giving a net migration gain of 44,400.A further 32,700 more people were born in the area than died, the figures showed.
Eight of the 10 local authorities with the biggest population growth between 2004 and 2014 were in London.The remaining two were Corby in the East Midlands and Slough in the South East.
There were 16 local authorities, meanwhile, which saw their population fall over the last decade. The greatest loss was seen in Kensington &amp; Chelsea in West London - which lost 5.8 per cent of its population.
The main driver of this decrease was net internal migration, a high number of people moving to live elsewhere in the UK.
However, the majority of local authorities suffering falling populations were in the North of England.
The populations of Barrow-in-Furness and Cleveland slumped as families moved to other areas of the country for work.

	Tories tell firms to increase wages as benefit cuts loom and poverty is at lowest since 80s

	Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said work remained the best root out of poverty, and called on companies to increase pay for their staff ahead of planned cuts to tax credits.

Speaking in the Commons, Mr Duncan Smith told MPs: 'I believe today's figures demonstrate that if you deal with the root causes of poverty - and I believe this Government is doing that - then even under a measure of poverty I have consistently over the last few years described as flawed, you can still have an impact.'
The Tory government is planning to scrap Labours controversial child poverty target within weeks.
The legally binding target to eradicate child poverty by 2020 is to be repealed.
In a speech this week, David Cameron said: 'Because of the way it is measured, we are in the absurd situation where if we increase the state pension, child poverty actually goes up.
Poverty levels remained level in the last year, but the proportion of people in absolute low income after hosuing costs has risen steadily in recent years
Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee, said: 'Politicians might understand these measurements but the electorate certainly doesn't. What I hope would interest the electorate is action to prevent poor children becoming poor adults.
'We must therefore begin talking about, and measuring, poor children's life chances and how they can be improved. It is important that such measurements are accurate, but that they can also safely drive anti-poverty policy.'
However, charities warned that levels of poverty were still too high and warned further benefits cuts would make the problem worse.
Javed Khan, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, said:'Every child living in poverty is a child that's being let down. Child poverty is a direct reflection of a failure, as a society, to protect our most vulnerable families.
'Poverty is blighting the life chances of our children, making them more likely to fall sick, do less well at school and be unemployed in the future. Government plans to cut struggling families' incomes further by changing tax credits is deeply concerning.'
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said work remained the best root out of poverty, and called on companies to increase pay for their staff ahead of planned cuts to tax credits
Matthew Reed, chief executive of the Children's Society, said: 'Moving the goalposts by changing the definition of child poverty will do nothing to help the millions of children who are suffering in real poverty.
'The Government needs to stop debating definitions and start doing more to help children.'
The 28billion budget for tax credits paid to working people is expected to suffer the biggest cuts in George Osborne's Budget on July 8.
Tax credits are paid to people whose income from work is judged not enough to live on.
Ministers have demanded that firms pay their staff properly instead of relying on the benefit system to top up their workers' wages through tax credits.
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'The extreme cuts to tax credits the Government is planning for working families will do nothing to raise wages and will leave low-paid families even worse off. There's a big danger this will start poverty rates rising again.'

Another shot shows a massive crowd of children gathered at the flogging site, with young fathers holding theirs sons and elderly men struggling to view the atrocity from behind teenage boys.
Bizarrely, at least two of the boys wear football shirts belonging to Western clubs - Italy's AC Milan and France's Paris Saint-Germain - a chilling reminder of how their innocence is being corrupted by witnessing rape, massacre and unduly harsh public punishments on a near-daily basis.
Throughout the month of Ramadan, which began last Thursday, the majority of Muslims abstain from eating, drinking, smoking and having sex from dawn until sunset.
For most Muslims around the world, fasting is down to personal willpower, but under the brutal rule of ISIS, which regularly stages public beheading, stonings and crucifixions those accused if crimes, the punishments for not obeying religious law is unsurprisingly harsh.

ISIS MILITANTS RE-ENTER KOBANE: JIHADIS DETONATE SUICIDE BOMB AND LEAVE BODIES STREWN ACROSS SYRIAN TOWN'S STREETS
ISIS fighters have re-entered the key Syrian town of Kobane, detonating a suicide bomb and battling Kurdish forces in the streets.
At least 12 people have been killed and 70 wounded as the terror group attacked the town on three sides after reportedly coming across the border from Turkey.
ISIS battled for four months to seize the border town last year, but Kurdish fighters backed by US-led air strikes wrestled back control in January in a symbolic victory.
In the months since, forces of the Kurdish People's Protection Units have advanced from Kobane in Aleppo province into neighbouring Raqqa province, a stronghold of ISIS.
In recent days, they captured the strategic town of Tal Abyad, also on the border with Turkey, and pushed towards ISIS's de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city in the Euphrates valley to the south.
The news comes just days after ISIS savages tied two young boys to a beam by their wrists and left them hanging in the air for several hours after accusing them of breaking the Ramadan fast.
The shocking incident took place in the village of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province and involved boys 'aged under 18', according to the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights.
The Hisbah, seized the two boys at some point over the weekend and suspended them from a pole in a public square alongside a placard informing passers by that the pair were being punished for eating during daylight hours.
Residents of the village of Mayadeen in Deir Ezzor province reported that IS suspended from a crossbar two boys aged under 18 near the HQ of the Hisbah', Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based human rights monitor revealed.
'The children have been suspended by ropes from a pole since noon, and they were still there in the late evening... Apparently, they were caught eating,' he added.
A placard was attached to the bodies reading 'They broke the fast with no religious justification'.

'Warsaw Modlin Airport received an anonymous call that there was an explosive device on a Ryanair aircraft due to take off from Modlin to Oslo at 8.40am local time,' the spokesman said.
'The airport security authorities ordered an immediate inspection of the aircraft (which hadn't yet boarded) and closed the airport to inbound arrivals as a security precaution.'

The spokesman went on: 'Warsaw Modlin believes this is a hoax call and expect the security sweep to confirm this fact. They expect to release the aircraft and reopen the airport shortly.
'Ryanair sincerely apologises to the customers of the outbound Oslo flight for any inconvenience caused by this hoax call.'
Earlier reports from the news agency Reuters had suggested that the plane was forced into an emergency landing at the airport and that the captain had radioed the airport requesting clearance.

Mr Cameron called for both countries to work together, insisting there was 'no point either side trying to point the finger of blame'.
Police found around 350 migrants hidden in cars and trucks within just four hours yesterday morning,
In addition, Home Secretary Theresa May said British and French authorities had stopped 'significant numbers' of migrants from entering the UK in recent days.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'They were all fine and taken by police to Dover Immigration Centre and are now under their care.'
The worsening migrant plight near the Port of Calais has seen numbers camped there swell to more than 3,000 since April.
Aid workers have reported a 'catastrophic' situation, with predictions that some 2,000 more migrants displaced from war-torn countries including Eritrea, Syria and Afghanistan could arrive over the summer.
Statistics showing the number of people who applied for asylum in the UK in the month of April are due to be released today.

	Notorious criminal Charles Bronson, known as Britain's most violent prisoner, has sent Leah Washington, 17, a 'get well card' after she lost her leg in the Smiler crash at Alton Towers in June.

He claimed to kill off his previous persona Charles Bronson last year, by selling off all of his darker artworks.
The collection of around 100 works, based around the themes of torture and insanity, included satirical images of Simon Cowell and Prince Charles.
The 62-year-old prisoner now creates much calmer and less disturbing artworks, and donates many of them to help sick children in hospital.
He has also donated two pieces of artwork and a signed, self-written book to four-year-old leukaemia patient Frankie Allen.
It was while helping Frankie that Charles pen-pal Darren Holdcroft first heard about Leahs story, which he passed on to the prisoner, according to the Mirror.
Its a side not many people get to see, Darren told the Mirror.
Horrifying immediate aftermath of Smiler roller coaster accident
Changed man?: Charles Bronson changed his name to Charles Salvador last year, in honour of the Spanish surrealist painter Salvador Dali, and transformed his art from disturbing to charitable
Disturbing: Some of the prisoner's previous art works focus on themes such as torture and insanity. A piece of art by Bronson, or Salvador, now fetches anywhere between 400 and 1,000 at auction
Exhibition: A series of Charles Bronson's artworks appeared on the London Underground during a controversial two-week exhibition in 2010. He now donates art works to sick children in hospital to help them raise money for treatment
The amount of art he produces for sick children is unbelievable and he has helped raise thousands of pounds and hopefully now he can help to raise some funds for Leah and her familys charities too.
An artwork by Salvador is said to collect anywhere between 400 and 1,000 at auction, largely due to his very violent reputation.
His intimidating rap sheet includes convictions for wounding, threatening to kill, damaging prison property and taking hostages while behind bars.
Of his 62 years, he has spent more than 40 behind bars, despite never actually committing murder.
He has done time in more than 120 prisons, including Broadmoor, Rampton and Ashworth; has taken at least 11 hostages; done more than half a million pounds in damages; and spent just four months and nine days out of prison since 1974, according to ozy.com.
Reputation for violence: Bronson (left) has spent 40 of his 62 years behind bars, for crimes including wounding, threatening to kill, damaging prison property and taking hostages while behind bars. Although he has never committed murder, he continuously increases his sentences by committing criminal acts while in prison. He was played by actor Tom Hardy (right) in a 2008 biopic entitled 'Bronson'
His prison career began in 1974 when he was arrested for stealing 26.
But his violent behaviour in prison has seen him consistently extending his sentences.
In 1998, for example, seven years were added to his jail sentence after he took two Iraqi hijackers and another inmate hostage at Belmarsh prison in London.
While insisting that the hostages call him General, he told negotiators he would eat one of the hostages unless they gave in to his demands.
He wanted a helicopter to Cuba, two Uzi sub-machine guns, 5,000 rounds of ammo and an axe.
At one point, he demanded one of the hostages hit him over the head with a metal tray, and when the hostage refused, Bronson slashed his own shoulder six times with a razor blade, according to the BBC.
In court he admitted that he was as guilty as Adolf Hitler, but added: I was on a mission of madness, but now Im on a mission of peace and all I want to do now is get home and have a pint with my son.
The criminal has one son, Michael, by his first wife.
When he married a second time, to Bangladeshi-born divorcee Fatema Saira Rehman, he spent a four-year stint as a Muslim.
His wife persuaded to convert and to go by the name of Charles Ali Ahmed, until the couple divorced four years later and he renounced Islam.
Since adopting a more creative and less destructive style of life, he has won 11 Koestler Trust Awards  which honour art by prisoners  and taken part in a controversial two-week exhibition on the London Underground in 2010.

Eleanor Hawkins, 23, from Draycott in Derbyshire, was thrown behind bars for apparently offending the gods by stripping off with other tourists at the summit of the mountain.
Hours later,18 people were killed and hundreds left stranded when an earthquake struck.

Climbing activities on Mount Kinabalu, on the island of Borneo, are expected to be suspended until September
Locals blamed a group of tourists - including the British university graduate  - for triggering the quake.
They believed that when she and others posed topless for a photograph, they were 'showing disrespect to the sacred mountain'.
The aeronautical engineering graduate was arrested with three others, fined 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (859) and sentenced to three days in jail,which she had already served, at a court hearing in Kota Kinabalu.
She later travelled back to the UK where she made a tearful public apology.
Speaking outside her home in Derby last month, shesaid: 'I just want to say how relieved and happy I am to finally be home.
'I know my behaviour was foolish and I know how much offence we all caused to the local people of Sabah. For that, I am truly sorry.'

	Foreign exchange manager Jenus Fiouzi, 43, claims key decisions at Commerzbank AG's London office were made during all male drinking sessions to which she wasn't invited.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

'It then became evident to me that decisions about work matters were being taken during drinking sessions because when the same matters later came up in the office, I was out of the loop.'
She added: 'The men's social relationships really strengthened their working relationships, so by excluding me from the social side, I felt they put up a barrier at work.
'My team frequently excluded me from business discussions by insisting on communicating in German when I was around.'
She said some colleagues would talk across her in German adding: 'This excluded me and made me feel uncomfortable and marginalised.
Jenus Fiouzi told a Central London Employment Tribunal that her colleagues at the London branch of Commerzbank AG (pictured) often spoke German in front of her, leaving her feeling 'isolated and outnumbered'
'There genuinely were two sets of rules. One for German men and one for me.
'As a woman I was seen as easy to challenge and my achievements were less important than a man's, particularly a German man, and therefore easy to dismiss and redistribute to the wider team.'
Ms Fiouzi said she had never experienced such treatment in the workplace before.
She added: 'I am a woman who does not go around making these accusations lightly.
'I have worked in this industry, and it is a tough industry, for 15 years, where I have worked with lots of different people from lots of different nationalities and they are all mostly men.
'In 15 years I have never [had] this level of discrimination in any workplace.
'I made suggestions about how to make improvements, but no one wanted to hear my suggestions. They said I was rocking the boat.'
Speaking outside the tribunal hearing, Jennifer Sole, of Ms Fiouzi's legal team, said: 'Ms Fiouzi is claiming around 7million from Commerzbank for loss of earnings and injury to feelings.'
There were two sets of rules. One for German men and one for me
Commerzbank denies all the allegations claiming Ms Fiouzi was let go because she failed to meet targets.
In a statement the bank said: 'Commerzbank categorically denies that Ms Fiouzi was subjected to any detriment on the grounds of her race, gender or of any other sort.
'Her descriptions of working life at Commerzbank's London office bear little relationship to the reality and the allegations she makes are all denied.'
In its evidence to the tribunal the company said: 'It quickly became apparent that the claimant was a difficult person to get on with and did little to integrate herself with the team.'
Commerzbank also says Ms Fiouzi's 'conduct at work was often disruptive' and that 'she argued with colleagues' and 'ignored instructions'.
But Trevor Malin, head of the Foreign Exchange Sales in London, said she failed to join in with the team rather than her being shunned.
He told the tribunal: 'Whenever I heard them speaking German, it was clear that they were discussing the work that they were doing together, confirming numeric values and were not discussing matters that would disadvantage Jenus in any way.
'In her claim Jenus seems to suggest that the business of the desk was conducted in German. That is not correct. The business of the desk was conducted in English and all team meetings and discussions were held in English.
'My German would not have been good enough to conduct such meetings in German.
Ms Fiouzi was fired by the bank in October 2014 and is claiming 7million for loss of earnings and injury to feelings after suffering sex and race discrimination and unfair dismissal
'What she says about there being a "band of brothers" or that there was a boyish frat-like atmosphere is incorrect.
'It is paramount that the sales and trading desks work together effectively as a team. Communication and developing relationships with colleagues are key.
'It is not unusual for employees of the bank to meet at the pub after work, especially after some stressful days.
'Having a drink together after work is a great way to build relationships and wind down after a hard day.
'There was no formal invitation to people. There was a standing invitation and it was well known by everyone that employees would go to a bar called the Fine Line, which was very close to the bank's office. I would pop in on my way home about twice a week.
'Jenus in common with everyone else, was invited, but only very rarely attended. That was symptomatic of her overall failure to integrate into the team. Neither sex nor nationality was relevant at all to employees socialising.'
He said Ms Fiouzi 'integrated poorly into the team and continually seemed to have issues' with other staff.
Jenus told me on several occasions that she was unhappy with the way things were going
Managing Director Jessica James, head of quantitative solutions group told the hearing: 'Jenus alleges that there were no senior female managers on the trading side of FIC - fixed income and currencies.
'That is incorrect. There are, I understand, 18 senior females, directors and managing directors in FIC, including me. I work on the trading side.'
She added: 'I ended getting on well with her. Towards the end of her time with the bank, I realised Jenus was unhappy.
'Jenus told me on several occasions that she was unhappy with the way things were going for her in the business sense.
'I understand Jenus is alleging that she was discriminated against because of her sex and race. Jenus did not raise with me at any time any complaint of mistreatment on the grounds of her sex or her race.
She added that she would would have encouraged Ms Fiouzi to go to the bank's HR team if the matter had been raised.
'I understand that Jenus makes general complaints about the bank being discriminatory towards women and non-Germans. I do not believe this is the case. I have never felt that the bank discriminates against women or non-Germans.
'I have never seen any evidence of this and of discrimination against female or non-German colleagues. I have never seen this at all.
'I don't recognise the German speaking club atmosphere at all. The trading floor was very inclusive, diverse and respectful towards women. I don't recognise the picture that has been painted.'
The tribunal continues.

A car was spotted today outside an Asda store bearing the flag of terrorist-associated organisation Hezbollah.
The sighting,in Wembley Park, comes one day aftera man strolled past the Houses of Parliament draped in an Islamic State flag with a young girl on his shoulders.
Both actions have been deemed 'within the law' by police, despite the latter making many feel unsafe on the streets of Britain.
Political statement: The emblem, printed on to a Syria flag, was spotted on the side of a car in an Asda car park in London
Hezbollahis a Shia militant group and political party based in Lebanon, which was formed with Iranian support  in 1982 after an Israeli invasion.
The group's military arm is considered a terrorist organisation by many developed countries in the world including the UK.
Recently Australian security forces decided it would remain  listed as a terrorist organisation as the group is still involved in the 'planning, coordination and execution of terrorist attacks', reports the Guardian.
Hezbollah's external security organisation (ESO) has previously been accused of a number of terrorist attacks against Jewish and Israeli targets.

This includes the 1994 bombing of an ArgentinianIsraeli institution in Buenos Aires that killed 85.
And three years ago it was accused of blowing up an Israeli tourist bus in Burgas, Bulgaria, killing six.
The organisation has recently been working alongside Syrian government forces to recapture the strategic city of Zabadani, near Damascus, from rebels.
Proud of terrorist-associated group: TheHezbollah flag is visible in the Asda car park in Wembley Park, much to one shopper's surprise
Today, the group's emblem was seen printed on to a Syria flag on the side of aSubaru Impreza parked outside an Asda store.
Responding to the sighting, police said:'Wearing, carrying or displaying of an emblem or flag, by itself, is not an offence unless; the way in which, or the circumstance in which, the emblem is worn, carried or displayed is such as to cause reasonable suspicion that the person is a supporter or member of a proscribed organisation.'
The same legislation was quoted in response to the incident outside the Houses of Parliament yesterday, to the frustration of many witnesses.
One social media user called Gavin tweeted: 'Why are we allowing this to happen on our streets a man walking past big ben with an ISIS flag.
'Walk through London past Big Ben with an ISIS flag nothing done do it with swastika what would be done?'
Tony Lancaster said: 'Man walks round central London with an ISIS flag but wasn't arrested because he broke no laws.Cud only happen here.'
Henry Lawson said: 'Man &amp; child with Isis flag London....hope this is hoax.'
The pictures have caused particular panic as they were taken as Londoners prepare to mark a decade since the July 7 terror attacks.

Scotland Yard said officers spoke to the man and considered his actions within the Public Order Act 1986.
A spokesman said: 'This man was spoken to by officers with consideration given to relevant legislation and a decision was taken by officers at the time that the man was acting within the law. He was not arrested.'
The Public Order Act states that a person is guilty if he: 'Displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby.'
A Home Office spokesman said: 'ISIS is a prescribed group. Showing signs you are a supporter of that group is an offence.
'It was an operational decision and we cannot comment on individual cases.'
Last week London became the scene of a mock terrorist attack when emergency services took part in a drill ensuring they are prepared 'should the worst happen'.
Emergency services were faced with a Tunisian-style terrorist gun massacre during the two-day operation.
Former Scotland Yard terror chief Peter Clarke has warned that ISIS poses 'a huge and deadly threat'.

He said: 'At the moment we are arresting one person for terror-related crimes every day. That's the highest rate at any point in 15 years, apart from the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and 7/7. There are 120 people awaiting trial as we speak.'
But he added: 'Every year since 7/7, massive plots to commit terrorist acts have been thwarted.' He called UK counter-terrorism 'the envy of the world'.
Last month a flag decorated with sex toy symbols was mistaken for that of Islamic State in a CNN report on the gay pride parade in London.

	One policeman holds off 150 gatecrashers outside Wireless festival at Finsbury Park

	The officer charged to the front of a huge crowd as they banged at the green barriers surrounding the Wireless festival grounds at Finsbury Park in London.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
The newspaper reports that more than a million people have seen the video online.
In the film, a police officer can be seen running towards a crowd as they repeatedly strike the metal barrier.
Despite the potentially dangerous situation, the officer bravely pushes his way to the front.
Seconds later, the crowds suddenly move away before festival security guards move in to help secure the area.
One-man show:He went on to single-highhandedly fend off the would-be festival-goers, armed only with a metal baton, until security guards at the event turned up to help
The footage then goes on to show a struggle involving a smaller group in which the officer can be seen holding a metal baton as he works with security to keep the crowd back.
The scenes turn even uglier as missiles appear to be thrown, clattering against the metal barriers inches above their heads.
Some in the crowd appear to wave others over towards the flash point as security guards try to ease tensions.
The Standard quotes an eyewitness as saying: 'The officer was unbelievable. It looked like people were ready to start a riot and he showed no fear. He just bowled in there and dealt with it all single-handedly.'
Chief constable for Surrey Police Lynne Owens tweeted: 'Shocking footage... As ever, officers run towards trouble, even when alone.'
It says Hackney police sergeant Richard Bern then tweeted: 'Just by being there, this officer likely prevented a GBH. Putting the safety of others before his own.'
The officer has yet to be named by Met police.
The unnamed officer was praised for his bravery, having prevented scores of intruders from storming into the three-day festival
Chaos as gatecrashes try to get into Wireless festival
The Standard reports that police are not taking action over the crowd trouble and quotes a Wireless Festival spokesman as saying: 'There were a small number of incidents that were dealt with quickly where no-one was hurt, on an otherwise hugely successful Wireless weekend.
'Organisers of Wireless Festival take security very seriously and work closely with ShowSec Security, Local Police and other agencies to put procedures in place to ensure the event maintains an enjoyable and secure environment for all its customers.'
Wireless festival this year featured the likes of Kendrick Lamar, Drake,DJ David Guetta and singer Jessie J.
Organisers faced embarrassment after American rapper and hip hop star Nicki Minaj missed her supporting slot because of 'travel issues'.
A message which flashed up on screen at the festival saying: 'Special announcement: we are told that she was due to be speeding down the M1 from Luton Airport as we speak but we have lost contact with her, we are hoping that she will be here soon.'
The Starships singer finally made it on stage to perform one song with festival headliner David Guetta, her spokesman said.

	Boris Johnson says cut 45p tax rate AFTER bosses pay their staff properly

	The London Mayor said a tax cut for the wealthy cannot be supported until business leaders pay their staff a living wage which means they do not have to rely on welfare to top up their income.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share

A study by Citizens UK this year showed that there were 5.2million low paid workers in supermarkets and shops the UK, receiving 11billion in state support through tax credits.
It is argued that if their firms paid them the Living Wage instead of the minimum wage it would save the taxpayer 6.7billion in benefits.
Mr Johnson said it was a 'serious problem' which needed to be sorted out before a cut in the top rate of tax can go ahead.
Writing in the Daily Telegraph , he said: 'It is simply not fair that a Budget should put more disposable income in the pockets of the rich and less disposable income in the pockets of the poor.
'And that, alas, would be the result if we were to cut top-rate tax and simultaneously to cut in-work benefits without any compensating improvements in pay.'
Mr Johnson pointed to figures showing that five of the country's biggest retailers  Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Next  receive '1billion-a-year in taxpayer-funded subsidies for their wages bill'
Reports suggest that workers at five of the country's biggest retailers  Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrison's and Next  receive 1billion-a-year in taxpayer-funded subsidies topping up their low wages.
Some businesses have already adopted the Living Wage of 7.85 an hour (9.15 in London), rather than the adult national minimum wage of 6.50.
Mr Johnson insists low pay is not a function of market forces. 'It's being propped up by the taxpayer. That needs to end. And that means business has got to start paying its people a wage they can live on.
'Yes, we should be cutting taxes all round  cutting the top rate as well as lifting the thresholds and taking the poor out of tax.
'We should have the most competitive tax regime in Europe. But we need to make clear to the business leaders of this country that we can only cut tax for them at the top if they do the right thing: treat their workers properly and pay them a living wage.'
George Osborne will use his first Conservative Budget this week to announce plans for deep cuts in tax credits, paid to people in work who earn too little to live on
Government has found 12 billion pounds of welfare cuts
Last week shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said it would be 'an act of gross irresponsibility and unfairness' for the Government to press ahead with a rumoured cut in the 45p rate for those who earned more than 150,000.
Mr Osborne yesterday indicated he is not planning to cut the top rate in the Budget, saying his priority is reducing taxes for lower and middle income earners.
Conservative former Cabinet minister John Redwood said cutting the rate to 40p would encourage the wealthiest to pay more tax.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The way to get more money off the rich is to have tax rates they are prepared to pay.
'We have just seen a big surge of revenues when we cut the 50p rate to 45p and that's very encouraging. Of course, Gordon Brown knew the right answer, the right answer was a 40% rate.'

	The victims paid money to Nigerian Adewale Adewole, 31, of Manchester, after he posed as a Royal Marine commando nicknamed 'Charismatic Brit' on the dating website Match.com.

'There was a profile picture on his Match accounts and he sent some of the women photographs of himself - all of these pictures were actually of a Royal Marine Commander called Joshua McGowan who knew nothing of what was going on.
'Each of the women wanted to find out more about him and were led to believe they were in a relationship with him. Although they arranged to meet, he never kept to the arrangements and never did meet any of the victims.
Miss Brandon added: 'He told the women that on a trip to Africa he was the victim of a crime and needed money. The crime meant he could not access his own funds. He said they would get their money back and would be sent letters from the World Health Organisation to show that he would be able to pay them.
The Match.com victims known only as Miss E, Miss A, Miss W and Miss H will get back just 863.38, 332.07, 199.26 and 819.10 respectively after police auctioned off the spoils of Adewole's fraud
'These letters were sent, but from an M30 Manchester postmark. He also sent them links to websites which, when logging in with details he gave them, appeared to show that he had a huge bank balance and would eventually be able to pay them back.
'One woman was asked to pay for a hotel for him. When she rang the number he gave her for the hotel, they also confirmed the information and she agreed to pay it. She later received a cheque addressed to him for 35,000 to prove he had money, but this was later discovered to be a stolen cheque forged in his own handwriting.
'Over a number of months each woman transferred significant sums of money via bank accounts and Western Union moneygrams and sent items to the defendant's home address. They bought electronic items, took out credit cards and loans and bought clothes from Next. Many of the goods were sent to his home address in Eccles from where the victims believed they would be forwarded on to the defendant in Nigeria.
'When the women stopped sending money they never heard from him again.'
The court heard the total amount stolen including the value of the household goods and Western Union transfers was 98,140.
Adewole was arrested in October 2012 at his flat and 4,500 in cash was found under his bed. A digital camera was found purchased by one of the victims, but containing pictures of the defendant and his wife and children. Designer clothes and shoes were also found worth 2,000 alone.
Adewole's wallet was also seized and contained several SIM cards, some of which contained the phone numbers of the victims. His two Blackberry phones were also seized - on these three different email accounts were in use which were linked to the two Match accounts. He was bailed and later tried to call one of the woman again under the name Timmy Francis and was arrested again.
When questioned he claimed to know nothing of the orphanage but that the 4,500 was his. He said the majority of the items found in his flat were to go to his mother in Nigeria. He admitted he had used Match.com in 2010, 2011 and 2012 but could not remember when exactly.
The victims known only as Miss E, Miss A, Miss W and Miss H will get back just 863.38, 332.07, 199.26 and 819.10 respectively.
Defence counsel Mr Khadim Al'Hassan said: 'I'm surprised by the amount from the auctions, it must have been a really bad day because they were all new items.'
