	As several masts went down across Britain, users in Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham, Glasgow and parts of Northern Ireland and London complained about the service.

And Emmerdale star Michelle Hardwick, who plays Vanessa Woodfield, said: 'Anyone else having problems with O2 signal tonight?' She later added: 'Come on O2, I want my signal back please.'
Craig Newrick, of Lowestoft, Suffolk. said: 'I have contacted O2 and got told to switch my device on and off again. It is really not good enough. What am I paying for?'
And Newton Emerson from Belfast said: 'O2 meltdown just forced me to make a landline-to-landline call. Old school. Felt guilty for making the other person walk out to their hall.'
O2 told customers on Twitter: We're working flat out (and upright too) to get these fixed. Sorry for the problems.
It also insisted that our engineers are beavering away and working to fix ASAP.
Long outage: Thousands of O2 customers were left without signal yesterday for up to nine hours
Sarcastic reaction:Senior Accountant Emma Wilson, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, tweeted of her anger
Making light of it: Marketing director Mimi Turner, of London, shared this joke about the service on Twitter
But others said that the response to customers' complaints from O2 had been inadequate.
Some were frustrated after simply being told to turn their phones off and on, but the problem was with the network rather than individual handsets.
One of them, Aaron Nelson, tweeted: 'The impersonal, predictable and robotic style of responses from O2's Twitter is an embarrassment. Still learning the internet?'
Another wrote: 'I might as well just go down the market and speak to a man in a white van. This is a shambolic response .'
Issues were also reported by users of Tesco Mobile and Giff Gaff, which run off the O2 network.
No signal, O2. Please sort it out
Business Secretary Sajid Javid
But O2 finally offered an explanation for the blackout yesterday afternoon  nearly 24 hours after the service failure started.
A spokesman said: The problem was caused by some network equipment that was temporarily unable to correctly process mobile phone traffic for some of our customers ... primarily the system that allows overseas customers to roam onto our network.
The problem also impacted a second piece of equipment that allows calls, texts and data for UK customers to be managed correctly on our network.
Some customers experienced an intermittent problem accessing our network and we apologise for the inconvenience caused to those customers who were affected.
We restored service at 23.35 [on Monday]. We have now isolated the problem to prevent this from happening again.
It is not the first time O2 has run into major network problems. In 2012 its network went down for more than 24 hours, leaving hundreds of thousands without signal.

	The study by the University of British Columbia found motherhood permanently alters the brain, affecting the parts responsible for memory and spatial awareness.

Although the experiments were done on animals, she told the Canadian Association for Neurosciences annual conference that she believes they are relevant to humans. For example, a woman who has never had children might be best off on a form of HRT that contains oestrone, while mothers may be better off without.
TARGET BABIES TO STOP RISE IN OBESITY
The NHSs obesity strategy is flawed because it is failing to target pregnant women and babies, a top doctor has warned.
Professor Neena Modi said that obesity begins in the womb because research has shown that babies born to very overweight mothers have already started to accumulate fat round their stomachs.
As a result, she argued doctors should intervene earlier, saying more should be done to train toddlers to prefer healthy food and make breastfeeding  which helps women lose weight  trendy. Professor Modi, who is president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: There have been millions directed to trying to intervene once obesity is established, and yet theyve all been failures, so we need to tackle the causes.
Last week Simon Stevens, chief executive of the NHS, warned that many children are facing a rising tide of cancer, heart disease and diabetes because of their weight.
She also has a theory about why many expectant women think they are more absent-minded than usual. Up to 80 per cent of pregnant women report suffering memory lapses commonly known as baby brain  and Dr Galea believes the cause lies in a combination of soaring hormones and shrinking grey matter.
Studies show a womans brain contracts by about 6 per cent during pregnancy, then quickly bounces back afterwards.
Plus levels of oestradial, a type of oestrogen linked to memory problems in very high doses, soar when pregnant.
However previous research has questioned whether the condition exists at all. Recent experiments in the US, in which pregnant and childless women completed mental tests, concluded there was no difference between the two groups in memory, thinking, attention span, organisational or spatial skills.
Whether the tests were taken during pregnancy or when looking after a young baby, the women did just as well as those who had never been pregnant.
However, when asked how they had performed, the pregnant women and new mothers thought they had done worse. They also said they had a lower quality of life and were less satisfied.
The Brigham Young University researchers said that the expectation of baby brain may be so strong that a pregnant woman is extra-alert to memory lapses.
So, although the lapses happen no more than usual, she may notice them more.
The studys authors said they wanted to give mothers-to-be a confidence boost  and urged pregnant women to resist stereotypes and have faith in their abilities.
'The more children you have given birth to, the greater risk you face of getting dementia in later life,' said lead researcherDr Liisa Galea

	Nicola Sturgeon says she will fight to 'lessen' budget cuts in Scotland, despite a report revealing the average Scot already has £1,600 more taxpayers’ cash spent on them than the typical Englishman.

She said: I think if David Cameron is serious about listening to people right across the UK, then he will want to take notice of how people in Scotland voted because it was him during the referendum on independence last year who said that Scotland should vote to stay in the UK and its voice would be listened to as part of the UK.
She added: If the UK Government sticks to its current proposals, we will argue for ways in which the impact on Scotland can be lessened.
A generous funding formula means that Scots have benefited for years from much higher public spending than the English.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines Scottish Business Pledge
The First Minister - pictured with the Scottish championship trophy Tuesday - said she would demand that the impact of the government's austerity drive should be 'lessened' north of the border
The gap, which stood at 1,496 per head in 2010, had widened to 1,597 per head four years later. Spending has fallen in both nations, but has dropped further and faster in England.
'The SNP won the election in Scotland fairly decisively on the basis of a pledge to argue the anti-austerity case, so that is what we will do', Sturgeon said
Conservative MP David Nuttall said Scotlands decision last year to vote to remain part of the UK meant it could have no argument with the Governments legitimacy.
The Bury North MP accused Miss Sturgeon of trying to whip up anti-Scottish sentiment in England by emphasising the gulf in spending.
He added: The SNP need to recognise they lost the referendum and are in opposition. When it came to the decision about whether Scotland should remain in the UK, the majority of people said they wanted to.
Part of that deal is accepting the winner of the General Election forms the Government of the entire UK. The SNP want to stir up anti-Scottish sentiment in England because they think it helps their cause.
However, in a significant shift, Miss Sturgeon said she now backs the Governments Charter for Budget Responsibility, which sets targets for tackling the deficit.
During the election campaign she had said Labours support for it was equivalent to signing up to the Tories plans for 30billion in cuts.
n Powers for Scotland to set its own income tax levels will be fast-tracked today in the Queens Speech.
The move could mean those north of the border pay less in income tax than the English, Welsh or Northern Irish.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the law will be rushed through by next February. The full devolution of all bands and rates would then be in force earlier than the estimate of 2019/20.

	Tom Hayes (pictured) appeared at Southwark Crown Court for day one of his trial in which he denies eight counts of conspiring to defraud. He is said to have manipulated lending rates between banks.

The trader, of Fleet, Hampshire, denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud covering a period from 2006 to 2010.
Hayes' case is the first trial concerning manipulation of Libor, the benchmark used to determine the interest charged on loans worth billions between banks.
Mr Chawla
said: '
This case is about the dishonest rigging of bank rates for profit.
'The prosecution say that throughout the period, he [Hayes] behaved in a thoroughly dishonest and manipulative manner by repeatedly cheating those with whom he had worked into huge financial transactions - in that way he set out to defraud.
'The motive was a simple one: it was greed.'
He added: 'He was the ringmaster at the very centre, telling others around him what to do and in a number of cases rewarding them for their dishonest assistance.'
'Mr Hayes's desire was to earn and make as much money as he could.
'The more that he earned for his employers, the more they would value his services and, inevitably, the more they would pay him.'
When Hayes felt that UBS was not paying him enough, he resigned and went to work for Citigroup, the jury was told.
However, within a matter of months - when his methods were formally reported to senior management at Citi - he was sacked.
Hayes set out to rig the rates at UBS and Citigroup but also 'clearly succeeded' in manipulating the rates of other banks, jurors heard
The case centres on the allegation that he was seeking to rig the submissions made by the panel banks, used to calculate that rate.
Mr Chawla said Hayes wanted his brokers to 'exert pressure' and use influence on banks to get them to submit their Libor in a way that was 'helpful' to his trading position.
The defendant did not deny making requests to influence Libor, he added.
'That would be nonsensical,' the prosecutor said.
'They speak for themselves. He has to accept he did set out with others to manipulate Libor.
'He says to you, that is not dishonest.'
WHAT IS THE LIBOR AND WHY DOES IT MATTER IF IT'S MANIPULATED?
The Libor rate, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is an interest rate at which banks lend money to each other around the world.
Rate rigging is when traders or brokers collude to set artificial rates, rather than genuine assessments of what the borrowing rates should be.
Bankers are able to take out bets, or contracts, based on the way the rates will move.
If they find a way to manipulate the rates, or persuade someone to manipulate them for them, then they are fixing the bet in their favour. This seriously undermines the integrity of the Libor financial system, on which global banks and financial institutions rely.
British trader Tom Hayes is charged with eight counts of conspiring to defraud by dishonestly manipulating the Libor interest rate.
The Libor rate is linked to the cost of trillions of pounds worth of investments and trades. It is set in many different currencies  Hayes is accused of fiddling the rate for Japanese yen.
The charges carry a maximum jail term of ten years.
The prosecutor said Hayes pestered a broker on his first day working for UBS, on September 29, 2006, saying to him: 'Do me a favour and get the Libor rate up?'
The court heard that in another message on the same day, he added: 'Can you sort me out on Libor?'
Mr Chawla said: 'On the first day he was trading he was making a request to get the Libor rate up.'
Other chat messages between Hayes and brokers reveal him offering to supply 'copious amounts of curry' in return for fiddling the rates, it is said.
'Seriously, whatever it takes, bill me,' he said.
Mr Chawla added: 'In the midst of that conversation Mr Hayes is having another conversation as well with another of his brokers.'
He begged for the Libor rate to be spun in his favour, writing 'please try, please', the court heard.
Hayes set out to rig the rates at UBS and Citigroup but also 'clearly succeeded' in manipulating the rates of other banks, jurors heard.
Mr Chawla said: 'All bankers want to maximise their profits, but Mr Hayes did it in a wholly dishonest way, concerned wholly with his profits and wholly unconcerned by the fact that he was cheating those with whom he was trading.
'In his own words, he was greedy.
The court heard that there had 'undoubtedly been some manipulation of Libor at UBS before Mr Hayes's own dishonest activity'.

Hayes was said to have told
investigators: '
The point is, you are greedy, you want every little bit of money you can possibly get ... that's how you are judged, that's your performance metric.'
Mr Chawla
continued: '
The prosecution say it was that greed that led to his dishonesty on an enormous scale.
'Mr Hayes' dishonesty involved doing everything in his power to manipulate bank rates known as the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor).'
Mr Chawla said Hayes used his power so that the lending rates were 'rigged to his financial advantage and therefore inevitably to the financial disadvantage of those with whom he was trading'.
Hayes traded in Japanese yen Libor derivatives, effectively betting on movements of the daily rate at which banks are able to borrow from each other.
The accused is said to have used kickbacks to middlemen known as brokers to help his plot to manipulate Libor to his own advantage.
The court was shown details of a chat in which Hayes told one: 'If you do this it will come back to you in spades.'
It was stated that in one case, Hayes asked a broker if he knew 'the guy who covers yen on your cash desk'.
He added: 'I will make sure it comes back to you. You will do well out of this... Basically can you ask him to broke three-month cash [rates for borrowing with a maturity of three months] lower for me today. I will look after you.'
Mr Chawla  said the ten-minute conversation was asking the broker 'to get his cash desk to speak to the banks to get the rate lower'.
The chat is followed up by a telephone conversation and 'there then clearly is a deal' in which Hayes is 'providing an incentive' to the broker in the form of a higher rate of payment.
'It is very much you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours,' Mr Chawla said.
'What this amounts to... is the manipulation of other banks' submissions for his own purposes,' he added.
In return there was 'money to brokers in the form of kickbacks', the prosecutor said.
Mr Chawla said: 'They were false and misleading because rather than being genuine assessments of the rate at which the bank could borrow money, they were designed to maximise Mr Hayes's profits.'
Hayes faces eight chargesof conspiracy to defraud and dishonestly seeking to manipulate Japanese yen Libor rates, which are used to determine the interest on loans between the banks (stock image)
The court was told that he enlisted the help of a large number of people from across a large number of different financial organisations to help him achieve this.
The prosecution said the dishonest rigging was not confined to the banks at which Hayes worked.
'He tried to rig, and in many cases succeeded in rigging, the rates at other banks,' Mr Chawla said, adding that Hayes did so by directly approaching those at banks or through middlemen, known as brokers.
Hayes begged brokers to help him spin the Libor rates in his favour and then handed them kickback payments by setting up 'utterly pointless' deals, the court heard.
'He would ask them, cajole them and even beg them into carrying out his wishes.
'In return for their assistance he rewarded the brokers, the middle men, in a number of ways,' said Mr Chawla.
'He would put additional trades through the brokers so they could earn brokerage fees on those.
'He also paid bribes to his brokers and one method of how he did this was through what are called wash trades.
'Wash trades in this context - they have no significant purpose, they are trades conducted with the brokers solely to generate substantial sums of money.'
Wash trades involved two banks striking a deal, and then putting through the same deal but reversing their positions.
By mirroring each other, there was no risk to the trade so neither bank lost or gained cash.
But the brokers still raked in substantial fees, jurors were told.
One wash trade between Hayes and a trader at RBS saw the broker rake in just over 35,000 in fees for the 'utterly pointless and corrupt trade', it was said.
'What they are actually doing is helping Mr Hayes manipulate Libor and these are the payments for the help,' said Mr Chawla.
Hayes set out to rig the rates at Citigroup and UBS but also 'clearly succeeded' in manipulating the rates of other banks, jurors were told
Hayes was a 'hugely successful trader' who bagged massive amounts of money for UBS while working at the Swiss bank.
During his interviews with the SFO Hayes bragged he raked in just over 1m in 2006, but added he had only been working there for two months, it was said.
In the following year he netted around 25m, with his profits rocketing to 61m in 2008.
In the nine months he worked of 2009 before quitting for Citigroup Hayes bragged he earned around 94m for the UBS, the court heard.
Hayes scored just under 1.3m during his time at UBS in salary and incentives, with his salary soaring to more than 3.5m for his stint at Citigroup, jurors were told.
The prosecutor said the case may seem complicated but
was in fact
simple.
'You do not have to be bankers or financial experts to understand what this case is about.
'The primary focus of this case is whether Mr Hayes, in doing what he was doing, was dishonestly rigging or manipulating Libor.'
Jurors will be shown emails and further tape recordings as part of the evidence during the trial.
Speaking of Hayes, Mr Chawla
added: '
He is a very intelligent man.
'As a trader he was highly successful and generated profits for his employer UBS which on any view were simply enormous.'
'You will be able to hear him actually committing these offences.'
Jurors will be shown emails and tape recordings as part of the evidence into Mr Hayes alleged manipulation of Libor
Mr Chawla said four of the eight charges against Hayes related to his time with UBS, while the other four covered his work with Citigroup, adding that he entered into 'many arrangements, dishonest arrangements', with many other people to 'harm the financial interest of others.'
Mr Chawla told the jury: 'From September 2006 to 2009, you're going to hear and see evidence that on an almost daily basis, he set out to dishonestly manipulate or rig Libor at his bank and other banks.'
Hayes was arrested in December 2012 and spent the next five months being interviewed by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over 82 hours, the court heard.
'He admitted his guilt, setting out precisely what he had done with whom,' Mr Chawla said.
Hayes offered to give evidence about a 'large number of other people', the prosecutor told the court. He implicated a number of other traders, including a member of his own extended family.
Mr Chawla said: 'Despite the evidence and admission in interview, Mr Hayes claimed what he was doing in rigging and manipulating Libor was not dishonest.
'You may think, having heard the evidence, that Mr Hayes was the epicentre, controlling and dictating exactly what he wanted to happen.'
The prosecutor told the court that 'no one is suggesting' Hayes 'should 'bear the weight of Libor on his shoulders' but his role 'stood apart from and above' other people.
He added that Libor was 'critical to trillions of pounds of investment' in the UK and around the world and Hayes's actions 'struck at the very integrity of that system'.
Hayes graduated from university in 2001 with a degree in maths and engineering before taking a position on the Royal Bank of Scotland's graduate scheme.
He went on to join the Royal Bank of Canada before taking up posts with UBS and Citigroup.
Police arrested him as part of a massive criminal inquiry into the scandal by the Serious Fraud Office.
During 82 hours of police interviews, Hayes said he was willing to share evidence against others involved.
'In the course of those interviews he names those with whom he had acted and with whom he had agreed to manipulate the rates,' the court was told.
'He set out precisely what he had done with them.'
Hayes told investigators: 'I probably deserve to be sitting here.
'At the end of the day my trading book benefited.'
But his actions could have impacted on trillions of pounds worth of contracts and loans on a global scale, jurors were told.
Hayes, of Caterham, Surrey, has eight counts of conspiring to defraud at Southwark Crown Court. If found guilty, he can be given a maximum jail term of 10 years
Mr Chawla said: 'We are concerned in this case primarily with the Libor within the Japanese Yen currency.
'First of all why is Libor important, what does it matter if it was rigged? The integrity of Libor was fundamental to the operation and confidence of both UK and international financial markets.
'It represents the rates of interest that the leading banks charge one another on what is called the inter bank market for loans in different currencies.'
Jurors were told it is 'one of the principle benchmarks' against which a vast array of deals were struck.
'The importance of Libor touches everyone, from large international conglomerates to small borrowers, a huge number of investments and trades were referenced to Libor,' Mr Chawla added.
'Libor generally therefore is critical to trillions of pounds of investments and contracts both in the UK and around the world.'
Hayes' alleged actions 'struck at the very integrity of that system'.
Hayes, of Caterham, Surrey, denies eight counts of conspiring to defraud that carry a maximum jail term of 10 years.
The trial, which is expected to last for between 10 and 12 weeks, continues.

	Asger Juhl chased Allan the rabbit around the studio before killing it and taking it home to eat. He claimed he did it to raise awareness of 'the hypocrisy of animal welfare.'

Juhl said he had been shown how to dispatch Allan humanely by a keeper at Aalborg Zoo who kills several baby rabbits each week to feed to the snakes.
They use an iron stick. I didnt have an iron stick  so I used a bicycle pump, he said.
He and his children, aged six and eight, skinned the dead rabbit and made a stew for dinner.
Many people in Denmark are frustrated about us killing the rabbit but at the same time they are having meat for dinner, he said. They are not taking into account that you are supposed to kill an animal before you eat meat. Let me ask you a question: Why would it be wrong to kill an animal and then eat it?
Shocking: Radio presenter Asger Juhl (pictured holding Allan the rabbit) hit the rabbit with a bicycle pump after debating about animal rights
Danish DJ describes moments leading up to rabbit's on-air death
Yesterday, there were growing calls for a boycott of Copenhagen-based Radio24syv over Juhls disgusting behaviour.
One person wrote on social media: You could probably easily have had the debate on air without having to kill an animal.
Andother added: Maybe somebody should hit you on the head with a pump, see if that provokes a debate.
Others described the incident as a brutal publicity stunt.
The RSPCA said it would have investigated had the shocking events taken place in England or Wales. A spokesman added: The use of an animal in this way is completely unacceptable.
The radio station defended the incident, saying it wanted to highlight cruelty in the farming industry and hypocrisy over animal welfare.
We didnt do it for the sake of entertainment, it said. Thousands of animals die each day so that people can eat them.
It claimed that Allan had enjoyed a good life, unlike many of the animals which end up on the meat counter, and was killed in a humane manner.
TV personality and animal rights campaigner Linse Kessler, left, chased radio DJ Asger Juhl around the studio and attempted to rescue the rabbit from him.  Juhl later explained why he used a bicycle pump to kill the innocent rabbit. The 34-year-old said: 'I was very humane. I discussed this with people at the zoo before I did it'
Radio24syv added that it wanted to put more focus on one of the worlds most industrialised agriculture sectors.
It said that Allan was killed in a sound manner and did not suffer any harm.
It added: Our rabbit has had a good life, as a contrast to the way our industrialised agriculture treats animals every day.
Animals that end up in the meat counter, where most of us without any great reflection buy slaughtered animals, who have had a terrible life.
MailOnline readers expressed their outrage on the website last night. Korotki from Devon wrote: He should lose his job, and be prosecuted for animal cruelty.
I dont care what his justification might allegedly be, the facts speak for themselves and this idiots killed an animal by brutal means as a publicity stunt.
Chandelier from London said: I understand that he wanted to make a point but doing it in this way is rather barbaric. Poor rabbit. And Dirk Bruere from Bedford wrote: There is a vast difference between being beaten to death with an iron stick and a bicycle pump.
The former is quick and the latter slow and cruel.
Last year there was outcry in Denmark after a baby giraffe called Marius was killed and dissected in front of children at Copenhagen Zoo, before being fed to the lions.
Mr Juhl later justified his actions, commenting: 'Many people in Denmark are frustrated about us killing the rabbit but at the same time they are having meat for dinner'

The nine tanks arrived in the southern town of Matveev Kurgan on Monday, before being driven along the streets on Tuesday.
The picture, taken on a mobile phone, comes just days after a huge convoy, including rocket launchers, military trucks without licence plates and armoured personnel carriers, was photographed driving along a road near the town.
Spotted: The mobile phone pictures show the tanks on a freight train shortly after they arrived
Conflict: Locals in Matveev Kugan look at the tanks after they stopped at the train station
Normalised: The convoy's arrival seems to illicit little response from a family walking alongside
The arrival of the convoys will no doubt be seen as more aggression from the Russians towards their neighbours, who have been arming Ukraine's separatist rebels for months.
Matveev Kurgan is just 17 miles from the border, and just 72 miles from Donetsk, where some of the heaviest fighting of the 15-month conflict has taken place.
It holds a checkpoint between the two countries, but had to be evacuated temporarily in August last year when fighting got too near to the border, according to Russian news agency TASS .

An unemployed mother of four has spent 20,000 of child benefit on plastic surgery, saying: Growing old isnt for me.
Andrea Dalzell, 48, has had a full facelift, a neck and eyebrow lift, Botox, wrinkle fillers and a breast enlargement.
And she plans to spend even more of the money meant for her children to complete her transformation.

The grandmother-of-three flies abroad for package holiday-style operations carried out by foreign doctors at lower rates. She travelled to Budapest for her latest round of procedures, splashing out 3,500.
Miss Dalzell says that in 2003 she began saving up the 15-a-week child benefit she received for each of her four daughters.

But she puts the accumulation down to her 'thriftiness' and claims to only eat one meal a day and doesn't drink.
She claims that her children have never wanted for anything and that she has been able to afford the surgeries because of her good budgeting, adding: I have always known I would have surgery. Having wrinkles and bags and going grey just isnt me.

Miss Dalzells most recent cosmetic procedures in the Hungarian capital included a surgical brow lift and a cheek lift.
She bragged about the cosmetic holiday on Facebook, posting a picture of her puffy face and bruised eyes after surgery, and said the surgeon told her it took 20 years off her.
Posting a picture of her post-surgery puffy face and bruised eyes, she boasted that her cosmetic 'holiday' to the Hungarian capital set her back just 3,500 and included 'food, flights and hotel'.
She insisted it would have cost 10,000 to have the same procedure in the UK.
Miss Dalzell told The Sun that she next plans to have a bottom enhancement to achieve a figure like Kim Kardashians.

But she is now receiving less in child benefit as she has just one daughter left in full-time education. Miss Dalzell, from Workington, Cumbria, says it is therefore going to take a lot longer to save up for the next round of surgery.
The TaxPayers Alliance, which campaigns for the protection of taxpayers and their money, has slammed the abuse of the welfare system.
Jonathan Isaby, the groups chief executive, said: Taxpayers will be livid at what looks like a total abuse of the system.
Before surgery: Ms Dalzell says she started saving her 15 per week per child benefit money in 2003
Benefit payments are supposed to be used as a safety net for the most vulnerable, not as a fund for cosmetic surgery.
With finances so tight, benefits must only go to those who really need them.
Miss Dalzells daughters include 22-year-old Sophie, a glamour model convicted of a string of crimes, who was hauled back before the courts last year when she missed two probation meetings  because she was too busy getting a breast enlargement.
Sophie revealed last year that she had been arrested 25 times and said she wasnt afraid of spending a night in a cell because she knows she will get out the next day.
The model, who earns up to 4,000 a month, has 11 convictions  one for drunkenly attacking two police officers in 2012, for which she was ordered to do 400 hours of litter-picking.
Last May she missed the probation meetings to get breast enlargement surgery in Brussels to increase her bra size from a 32C to a 32DD.
She has previously refused to wear an electronic tag because she claimed it interfered with her adult TV work.
She said at the time: I will never walk away from a fight. If someone starts on me, I have got a right to defend myself.
I dont worry about going to prison as the courts only give you a community service or a fine.

Andrea Dalzell's daughter, 22-year-old Sophie, revealed last year that has been arrested 25 times and isn't afraid of spending a night in a cell because she knows she will get out the next day.
In May 2014 she missed two probation meetings to get breast enlargement surgery in Brussels and has previously refused to wear an electronic tag as it interfered with her adult TV work.
Speaking at the time, she said: 'I will never walk away from a fight. If someone starts on me, I have got a right to defend myself..
'It is usually girls I have trouble with. They make b***** comments about my appearance.
Miss Dalzell, originally from Workington, Cumbria but now lives in Ibiza, Spain, added: 'I am not scared of being in a police cell because I know I will get out the next day.
'I dont worry about going to prison as the courts only give you a community service or a fine.'
The model has 11 previous convictions. She drunkenly attacked two police officers in May 2012 - and was ordered to do 400 hours of litter-picking.
Within months, she was hauled back to court for missing two probation meetings to get a second breast enlargement in Belgium.
She faced the court for breaching the order by failing to give a 'reasonable excuse' for missing the January meetings.
But magistrates cleared Miss Dalzell when she produced a letter from a Brussels plastic surgeon and ordered her to pay a fine of 95 instead.
The model, who earns up to 4,000 a month, had her operation to increase her bra size from a 32C to a 32DD.
Speaking about the decision to go under the knife, rather than attend her meetings, she said the operation was important for her work so she 'didn't want to miss it.'

	Child sex abuse victim Esther Baker claims politician assaulted her as police stood guard

	Esther Baker told the police she was a among a group of children who were regularly abused by the politician on Cannock Chase, Staffordshire, during the 1980s and 1990s.

Appalling childhood: Esther Baker as a young girl
'One of them (the police officers) I knew from church. There were a few occasions where they would be in uniform, and I kind of knew, I learnt that when they were in uniform that it was going to be a rough night. On occasion they would ... they would sort of join in.
'There were a few occasions where they would be in uniform and I kind of knew, I learnt that when they were in uniform that it was going to be a rough night.'
Ms Baker said that on one occasion she tried to run away, but was stopped by a police officer who told her he was 'sorry'. The time has come for that officer to come forward, she added.
She explained that she was a 'favourite' of the politician, who she says is from the recent era but is not from Staffordshire, but only recently realised who he was.
The politician liked it when she played the piano, Ms Baker recalled, getting her to sit on his lap while she did so.
She
said:'
He was part of it for four years. One of the core members. He was there quite often - I was one of his favourites.
'I would know that face anywhere. I have lived with it and others in my head for over 20 years, I know every inch of
him,'
Ms Baker added.
She says she and the other children, of varying ages, were given alcohol and were often filmed.
Esther Baker recalls Police watching during childhood abuse
Ms Baker (pictured playing the piano as a child) was abused from the age of six by the politician and a group of men, which may have included a Lord and a judge
She believes a Lord and a judge may have been among her abusers, who she says also assaulted her inside buildings around Staffordshire.
Ms Baker has given a graphic account of her abuse to detectives and is now appealing to other victims to come forward.
She added: 'I always swore I would never go near the police again - never ... but I have hid it for 20 years, that has not worked, that hasn't taken the fear away - I have got nothing to lose any more.'
Staffordshire Police were unable to say whether the politician is still
alive,
or whether he is still in public office.
Ms Baker claims police officers would stand guard in woodland on Cannock Chase, in
Staffordshire,
while she and other children were sexually abused
Assistant Chief Constable Jon Drake said the force had launched an investigation into Ms Baker's claims.
He said: 'Staffordshire Police is in the early stages of investigating a number of very serious allegations from the 1980s and 90s. Specially trained officers are carrying out a number of interviews with the victim to build up an understanding of what took
place,
and her recollections of all those involved.
'We are determined to thoroughly gather any evidence which will allow us to bring those who may have been involved to
justice,
while taking a sensitive approach to supporting the victim throughout.
'We will continue to interview her over the coming days, recognising the horrific nature of what we are investigating. To be clear, regardless of role, anyone who has been involved in criminal offences will be investigated to provide justice for the victim.
'Child abuse is a terrible crime, whenever it occurs. We are keen to hear from anyone who knows more about the
allegations,
or any other victim of child sexual abuse.
'In this specific case the victim has made the decision to waive her right to anonymity. Staffordshire Police wants to reassure anyone who has been a victim of any form of child or sexual abuse that their anonymity will be protected.

        <MainBody>comments
A Russian man was given just what he deserved when he decided to grope his waitress - ending up flat on the floor after she smacked him repeatedly with the only weapon she had to hand: a menu.
CCTV footage of the incident shows how everything began calmly before something sparks a argument between the two.
The 53 second video captures the waitress handing the man the bill before he reaches across and appeared to touch her somewhere on her neck.
Anger: The argument quickly escalates - and the man ends up standing in a threatening pose
Hit: The waitress - who has already been groped and threatened - then hits with the menu in self-defence
Injured: She walks away, and others come to help her attacker up off the ground
She reacted quickly, pushing him away - but this apparently enrages the customer, who leaps off his seat.
As she tries to get away, the man gropes her bottom.
But this time the waitress used all her might to hit him with the menu - knocking her attacker to the ground.

	ISIS offers fighters $1,500 starter home bonus and free honeymoon

	The incentive emerged after a recently married Syrian ISIS fighter, Abu Bilal al-Homsi, spoke to journalists via Skype from the capital of the extremist group's self-proclaimed 'caliphate'.
      </Description>

'It has everything one would want for a wedding,' al-Homsi said of Raqqa  a riverside provincial capital that in the 18 months since ISIS took control has seen militants beheading opponents and stoning alleged adulteresses in public.
Gunmen at checkpoints scrutinise passers-by for signs of anything they see as a violation of Shariah, or Islamic law and people can be punished for something as slight as a hint of hair gel.

In the homes of some of the ISIS commanders in the city are women and girls from the Yazidi religious sect, abducted in Iraq and now kept as sex slaves.
The Islamic State group is notorious for the atrocities it committed as it overran much of Syria and neighboring Iraq.
But to its supporters, it is engaged in an ambitious project: building a new nation ruled by what radicals see as 'God's law,' made up of Muslims from around the world whose old nationalities have been erased and who have been united in the 'caliphate.'
To do that, the group has set up a welfare system to help settle and create lives for the thousands of jihadis, men and women, who have flocked to ISIS territory from the Arab world, Europe, Central Asia and the United States.
'It is not just fighting,' said al-Homsi, who uses a nom de guerre. 'There are institutions.There are civilians (that ISIS) is in charge of, and wide territories .
'It must help the immigrants marry. These are the components of a state and it must look after its subjects.'
Al-Homsi spoke in a series of interviews with The Associated Press by Skype, giving a rare look into the personal life of an ISIS jihadi.
The new ISIS elite is visible in Raqqa, the biggest city in Syria under the extremists' rule.
Luxury houses and apartments, which once belonged to officials from the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, have been taken over by the new ISIS ruling class, according to a member of an anti-Isis media collective in the city who goes by the name of Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi.

Road to Palmyra deserted but inside the city people celebrate
Raqqa, at the center of ISIS-controlled territory, is cushioned from the fighting around its edges. Its supermarkets are well stocked and it boasts several internet cafes.
'The city is stable, has all the services and all that is needed. It is not like rural areas the group controls,' al-Raqqawi said.'Raqqa is now the new New York' of the caliphate.'
Helping fighters marry is a key priority. Aside from the normal stipend, foreign fighters receive $500 when they marry to help them start a family.
The 28-year-old al-Homsi got a particularly large bonus because his new wife is a doctor and speaks four languages.
The AP has spoken with al-Homsi repeatedly over the past three years, since he started as an activist covering the fighting in his home city of Homs in central Syria.
An IT specialist before the civil war in 2011, al-Homsi always espoused ultraconservative views in media interviews, sympathizing with the idea of a caliphate.
He said he had supported ISIS as early as 2013. But it was in mid-2014, after a two-year punishing siege of Homs, that he turned into a fighter. When the siege ended in a May 2014 truce, al-Homsi emerged as an official Isis member.
It was from his social media activity that he met his wife, who admired his online media briefings.
After communicating online, al-Homsi found out that her brother had joined the group and was in the eastern Syrian city of Deir al-Zour.
Aside from the normal stipend, foreign fighters receive $500 when they marry to help them start a family
As is customary, he went to ask her brother for her hand in marriage.
The 24-year-old bride-to-be traveled through Algeria to Turkey, and from there to Raqqa with a group of other women joining ISIS.
They were housed in a guesthouse for women, where the ISIS women police force
Al-Homsi made the hazardous 150-mile (250-kilometer) journey from Homs to Raqqa to join her, after getting a recommendation from his local commanders.
It was a rare marriage of a Syrian male fighter with a foreign migrant. Usually, foreign women marry foreign fighters in ISIS.
During the few days of their honeymoon, al-Homsi and his bride enjoyed Raqqa's relative tranquility, riverside promenades and restaurants.
Then the couple travelled back to the Homs area, where ISIS fighters are holding ground against Assad's forces and rival rebel groups.
There, al-Homsi used the money from his grant to prepare a home for his new bride, and four kittens.
The couple is now expecting a new baby and hoping for another cash injection, as the group can pay up to $400 as a bonus for each child.
For now the group provides a stipend of $50 a month for him and a similar amount for his wife.
He also has an allowance for his uniform and clothes, some household cleaning supplies, and a monthly food basket worth $65.
Soon after speaking to the AP, al-Homsi was back on the battlefield, among the fighters who took over the ancient city of Palmyra earlier this month.
'The fighter is on the front,' al-Homsi said. 'How will he bring food to the house?'
Today it was revealed that hundreds of women have been kidnapped by jihadi fighters who send the 'prettiest virgins' to slave markets in the Syrian city of Raqqa, where they are sold as sexual objects to the highest bidder.
Many are stripped naked and forced to undergo virginity tests before being sent to the twisted auctions, the UN's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict has said.
Zainab Bangura discovered the gruesome extent of crimes against young women  particularly from Iraq's Yazidi minority community  after collecting information from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

The drills in the Central Military District have been reinforced by units from the Western and Southern military districts, the ministry added, as well as long-range aircraft.
However this week's huge show of strength has been widely interpreted as a direct response to Nato's exercises in the Arctic, which Moscow has roundly condemned as antagonistic.
For its part, Nato has insisted its own exercises do nothing more than provide reassurance to its eastern member states and non-Nato allies - including several former Soviet republics who have expressed fears that Russia may attempt to invade their territory.

FRENCH FILM STAR DEPARDIEU 'READY TO DIE' FOR HIS ADOPTED HOMELAND RUSSIA
French film star Gerard Depardieu has said he is ready to 'die' for his new homeland Russia because he does not want to end his days 'as a fool' in modern-day France.
The hellraising 66-year-old actor became a Russian citizen in 2013 to avoid paying higher taxes under a new socialist government in his own country.
He has now told Vanity Fair magazine: 'I am ready to die for Russia because the people there are strong.
'I absolutely do not want to die a fool in modern-day France...I don't believe in myself because I don't share the values that I was raised on. I don't feel French.
'Sometimes at night in my bed, I want to fall asleep forever. I have experienced everything. There are not many people who can say that, so I can die now.'
Depardieu was branded 'shabby and unpatriotic' when he quit France two years ago to dodge new heavy taxes on the very rich.
He then sparked further outrage in France and Russia when he defended President Vladimir Putin's clampdown on opponents and declared: 'The masses are stupid.'
Tensions between Russia and Nato countries have been dramatically heightened by the conflict in Ukraine, with the West accusing Moscow of staging a stealth invasion.
Moscow has also been accused of sabre rattling, with deputy Prime MinisterDmitry Rogozin stoking the flames ever further over the weekend by stating 'tanks don't need visas' during a national television debate on the U.S. and EU travel bans imposed on prominent Russian citizens, according to the Telegraph .
He later tweeted that the West faces no threat from Russia but instead faces 'collapse under the onslaught of ISIS and gays.'
News of the military drill comes as a top Russian diplomat says work is underway to fulfill his country's upply of advanced air-defense missiles to Iran, but that no start date for the delivery has been set yet.
In 2010 Russia froze plans to supply S-300 missile systems to Iran, linking the decision to U.N. sanctions.
But in April, President Vladimir Putin lifted the suspension after a framework agreement was reached that would restrict Iran's capacity to produce nuclear weapons.
The Russian move has been strongly criticized by the United States and Israel.
This morning, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said he could not 'say anything for now' about the missiles' delivery date.

Before his death on Friday Mr Spector enjoyed a final meal with his friends and family, who all posed for a photograph to mark the occasion. 16 hours after the photograph was taken he died.
In the hours before he entered the Dignitas clinic he said he was unable to contemplate a future trapped in his own body and dependent on others.
Last night his wife Elaine and their three daughters said they were 'in a state of all-consuming grief', but added: 'As a family we supported and respected Jeffrey's decision 100 per cent.

'Jeffrey ended his life with dignity and control which was his overwhelming desire.'
On the day after his death his 19-year-old daughter Courtney wrote on Facebook: 'To all who knew him, my dad sadly passed away on Friday. I love you so much, my best friend forever &amp; always. Rest In Peace Daddy x X Thank you to everyone for the lovely messages.'
Mr Spector's death will inevitably fuel the debate over the right-to-die issue in Britain  particularly as his condition was not believed to be a terminal illness.
The tumour wrapped around his spinal cord could not be removed and threatened to paralyse him from the neck down as it grew, leaving him living as a quadriplegic.
Mr Spector ran several advertising based companies in the seaside town.
DIGNITAS HELPS 273 BRITONS DIE
House of death: A Dignitas clinic near Zurich
Almost 300 Britons have travelled to Dignitas to end their lives.
Britons made up the second highest number of foreigners going to Zurich for assisted suicide between 1998 and 2014, exceeded only by Germans.
The organisation said 273 Britons had killed themselves with its help in its first 16 years, compared to 920 Germans and 194 French.
Dignitas was founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses to kill themselves in Switzerland, where assisted suicide is permitted in specific circumstances.
'Patients' must prove they are of sound
judgment
and be able to administer a lethal dose of a drug themselves.
In
2010
the organisation's fees were said to be almost 3,200 for preparations and the assisted suicide, rising to more than 6,500 for those wanting funerals, medical costs and other fees covered.
A colleague  said: ' We work on Jeffrey would want that-he was a grafter and learned his trade from his father Maurice.'
'He was successful at what he did and had a lovely family we called the Jeffrey's Angels.'
'He tried everything to have the tumour removed - he once went on a Vitamin C only diet as a form of alternative medicine. For all his success nothing worked.'
Mr Spector said he was not frightened of death but found the prospect of permanent paralysis unbearable, and chose suicide rather than live under that constant threat.
In an eloquent and moving final interview from Zurich, he
said: '
I wanted control of the final stages of my life. I was a fit and healthy person and my life has been turned upside down. What started as
back ache
in 2008 soon developed into an illness which led me to having to make
this most awful
decision.
'
He said his family had asked him to reconsider but insisted he believed his decision was 'the
least
worst option, which is best for my family in the long term'.
He
added: '
I am going before my time but I am not scared. The tumour could stabilise but I cannot take that chance.
'Some people will criticise me but do not judge me. Never judge anyone unless you have worn their shoes.
'

Assisted suicide is illegal in Britain, although campaigners have proposed a change in the law to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose for terminally ill patients with less than six months to live.
Mr Spector, an advertising executive, was diagnosed with the tumour six years ago and was told it was inoperable because of the way it was entwined with his spine. Despite treatment, it continued to grow.
The company director described himself to friends as a 'walking time bomb' and said he lived in fear of waking to find he could no longer move or speak.
He joined Dignitas five years ago as he began to contemplate suicide. Since the organisation was founded in 1998, more than 300 Britons have travelled to the Swiss clinic to die.
Mr Spector was still able to walk and drive but said his condition was worsening and he was losing control of movement in his hands. As the tumour grew it effectively strangled his spinal cord, reducing his brain's ability to send messages to his arms and legs.
Mr Spector
said: '
Had it been lower down the spine and I lost the use of my legs I would have been distraught but I could cope. Where it was meant total paralysis from my neck down  If I am paralysed and cannot speak what hope is there  send me to the spirit world.
'I am a proud person  a dignified person, independent and self-motivated  I believe in my human right to dignity.
'I want the ability to have a cup of tea and hold a phone  I want to be able to do those things myself. I believe what I am doing is in the best long-term interests of my family. They disagree with that of course but they do accept I have my own opinion.'
Mr Spector said he had no prospect of recovery, adding: 'I want my family to have a good life. I want them to move forwards.
'If they cared for me and I got better  fine. But I won't.'

Home: The family are coming to terms with Mr Spector's death at their five-bedroom house inLancashire
The family travelled to Zurich last week. They had commissioned a film-maker to record Mr Spector going about his daily life for two weeks, as a lasting memory for daughters Keleigh, 21, Courtney, 19, and 15-year-old Camryn, who is about to take her GCSEs. The poignant image of the last meal came from the film.
Before his death, Mr Spector also gave a full interview and photographs to their local paper, and the family's lawyer said they were happy for it to be given a wider airing.
It was not clear if all three daughters accompanied Mr Spector to Zurich. The family gathered at their five-bedroom home in Lancashire, last night, where they released a statement.
They said: 'Jeffrey was particularly clear that he did not want to live a life in which he was paralysed and reliant on his family to care for him.
'Earlier this year, Jeffrey's condition deteriorated to such an extent that he believed he would soon be permanently and completely paralysed.
'Whilst this was, of course, a difficult and painful time, as a family we supported and respected Jeffrey's decision 100 per cent.
'Whilst we are now in a state of all-consuming grief and miss Jeffrey very much, we also recognise that he is now at peace.'
One Brit every fortnight travels to use assisted dying facilities
ASSISTED SUICIDE: A LEGAL MINEFIELD WHICH SEES BRITONS GO ABROAD
Decision: Jeffrey Spector had an inoperable tumour and could not face being paralysed and being looked after by his family
Assisted suicide is illegal in Britain, and families who help their loved ones to die face potential prosecution.
The law sets a maximum jail sentence of 14 years for anyone who aids and abets a suicide, although there have been few recent prosecutions. Assisted dying campaigners claim one Briton a fortnight travels abroad to commit suicide.
A proposed change in the law to allow doctors to prescribe a lethal dose for terminally ill patients with less than six months to live was put before Parliament last year.
It ran out of time before the election, but Lord Falconer has said he will re-introduce the Assisted Dying Bill in the new Parliament. Any proposed change in the law will face fierce opposition from religious groups and critics who fear it could be abused.
Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, said Jeffrey Spector's death illustrated the potential dangers of legalising assisted suicide in Britain.
He said: 'The vast majority of people with cancer or quadriplegia  which was a risk but not a present reality for this man  do not wish to kill themselves but want support and care to go on living as comfortably as possible.
'Any change in the law to allow assisted suicide in Britain will inevitably place pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives so as not to be a financial or emotional burden.' Disabled rights campaigner Nikki Kenward said Dignitas risked sending a message that the lives of the disabled were not worth living. But Mickey Charouneau, a spokesman for Dignity in Dying, said it was unfair that the law forces the terminally ill to travel abroad to die.
He added: 'It cannot be right that we force people to suffer against their wishes, or take drastic and desperate measures behind closed doors. The only way to give dying people choice and control at the end of life, while also protecting vulnerable people, is through an assisted dying law with upfront safeguards.'

Joanne Croxford, from the Daisy Chains WI and Cambridge Bluebells, was drafted in to give a vegan baking masterclass to her fellow members and will also help run the stall.
She told MailOnline: 'It will be our first time at Glastonbury and we are so excited to be there and mark 100 years of the WI.
Joanne Croxford, from the Daisy Chains WI and Cambridge Bluebells, was drafted in to give a vegan baking masterclass to her fellow members and will also help run the stall
'The festival told us they would prefer it if we offer a vegan alternative and so as a vegan I've been helping out with recipes and ran a baking class with several members last month.'
She explained that the notion came after the chairman of the Somerset Federation was at the festival a few years ago and thought it would be 'lovely to one day have a stall here'.
With the help of Katie Newell, from Puriton and District WI, the idea was made into a reality and the women have been busy preparing everything from lemon drizzle to traditional Victoria sponge.
WI member Katie Newll says a cup of tea and a slice of cake is the best way to chill out after dancing
The WI chose to get involved at Glastonbury as part of its centenary celebrations and as a way of recruiting more members
Ms Croxford added:'The reason we're doing this is because we are so keen to celebrate the centenary and the WI's tradition by bringing it into today. 
'It's also a great way for us to represent the brand. There's a lot of prejudgment about the WI but when we're out there face-to-face we can meet people.'
She hopes that they will be able to recruit lots of new members through the stall, which will be staffed from 10am to 7pm throughout the five day event.
Ms Newell told the BBC they have prepared 1,000 cakes but guarantees that they won't run out, because 'we're the WI'.
'We don't know how many we'll sell but who doesn't need a cup of tea and a slice of cake at some point after a big party - it's the best way to chill out after you've been dancing,' she added.
AN ECLECTIC MIX: THE GLASTONBURY FESTIVAL LINE-UP 2015...
Rocking out!The Who have been confirmed as the final headline act of Glastonbury 2015, and will close the annual music festival in Pilton, Somerset, on Sunday night
This year's headliners at Worthy Farm have a little bit of something for everyone.
The British rockers, The Who, have vowed to close the annual music festival in Pilton, Somerset, 'with a bang' when they perform on the iconic Pyramid Stage on the Sunday night.
Pharrell Williams and Mary J. Blige are to bring their brand of R&amp;B, alongside legendary crooner Lionel Richie.
But rockers will be happy to hear Patti Smith and Motrhead have secured their place on this year's line-up and the famous festival.
Indie fans, old and new, will enjoy the chance to see Nineties darlings Suede as well as The Vaccines, The Maccabees and Alt-J.
Of course EDM will be represented with the likes of DeadMau5, The Chemical Brothers, Jamie XX, Hot Chip, Caribou, and Rudimental all securing a place to perform at Worthy Farm.
Hopefully lightning won't strike twice for Rudimental, after their set was cut short last year after an intense storm cut off electricity to the Pyramid Stage.
The final slot on the Pyramid stage has yet to be announced, with Kasabian closing the festival in 2014 but Friday and Saturday will be filled by Foo Fighters and Kanye West.
Kanye's scheduling on the line-up caused controversy with a petition launched to try and persuade Glasto founder Michael Eavis to ditch him from the line-up.

	Russia plans to use prison labour to drive down the cost of World Cup 2018

	Politician Alexander Khinshtein says he is planning to submit proposals to President Putin which would see prisoners taken to work in factories producing materials for the games.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

'And apart from that it'll make it possible to get prisoners into work, which is very positive.'
Russia's prison labour system has been the subject of criticism in the past, with officials accused of forcing criminals to work 16 or 17-hour days, with only one day off every six weeks.
FIFA officials refused to comment on the Russian plans, which come as the organisation is under scrutiny for the abuse of workers in Qatar
In 2013, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a member of protest band Pussy Riot, went on hunger strike after complaining about the conditions inside her prison camp in Mordovia.
In a letter, she alleged that prisoners were pressured into work despite illness and injury, and were forced to sign agreements which meant they could work all weekend.
She claimed beatings were common, carried out by the prisoners themselves on behalf of officials, and that inmates were often locked outside cell blocks as a punishment, leading to frostbite and amputations of fingers and toes.
She also claimed that, one month, she was paid just 29 rubles, the equivalent of 57 pence, for work - though Khinshtein claims World Cup workers will be paid $300 per month.
The plans would see prisoners taken from their camps each day, transported to factories under guard, then taken back to jail each night.
Russia has been under pressure to reduce the cost of the games from their initial $12.7billion budget after a collapse in the price of oil earlier this year sent their economy tumbling.
A sharp drop in the value of the ruble has driven up the price of importing materials, so the government has launched a policy of 'import replacement' - trying to use home produced materials instead of foreign stock.
FIFA has also come in for criticism over concerns it is promoting widespread abuse of workers after allegations that labourers working on the 2022 World Cup stadiums in Qatar are being subject to slave-like working conditions.
More than 1,000 labourers have died building the stadiums that will host the games in the oil-rich nation, it has been claimed, while others complain of horrific conditions in the scorching desert heat.
Khinshtein says he is putting a proposal together which will be submitted to President Putin for approval
According to rights groups, more than 1,000 labourers working on World Cup Stadiums in Qatar have died, while thousands more face virtual slave-labour conditions (file image)
An Amnesty International report detailed how some workers had not been paid for five months' work, saying this amounted to forced labour.
Equally disturbing is the presence of North Korean labourers, who have allegedly been sent there to work by Kim Jong-Un's regime, with most of their wages funneled back to line the dictator's coffers.
It has been claimed that workers from the isolated nation are forced to work 18-hour days, sleep on the building site, and are kept separate from the other labourers.
In recent weeks, authorities have also been accused of refusing to allow Nepalese workers to travel home to attend the funerals of family members killed in the recent earthquakes.
However, in Russia, there is no indication the prisoners will be sent to work on construction sites.
Asked about the Russian plans to use prison labor, FIFA spokesperson Delia Fischer said: 'We have not received any information on the below mentioned plans yet and as such cannot comment for the time being.'

It seems increasingly likely that the video could turn out to be one of the final documents of the ancient city, as the jihadis are expected to raise much of it to the ground in the same way the bulldozed the equally historic city of Nimrod and destroyed ancient artifacts in Mosul museum.
Even if ISIS decide not to destroy the ruins, their destruction may well come about from the battle to force the jihadis out of the city.
Just this morning separate video footage was released showing the destruction of ancient buildings in Palmyra's rubble-strewn suburbs following  intense airstrikes by Syrian regime warplanes.

ISIS JIHADIS BURN WOMAN ALIVE FOR REFUSING 'EXTREME SEX ACT'
A woman was burned alive by depraved Islamic State militants after she refused to take part in an 'extreme sex act', a United Nations official has revealed.
Hundreds of women have been kidnapped by jihadi fighters who send the 'prettiest virgins' to slave markets in the Syrian city of Raqqa,where they are sold as sexual objects to the highest bidder.
Many are stripped naked and forced to undergo virginity tests before being sent to the twisted auctions,the UN's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict has said.
Zainab Bangura discovered the gruesome extent of crimes against young women  particularly from Iraq's Yazidi minority community  after collecting information from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
She said: 'They (ISIS) commit rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution and other acts of extreme brutality.
'We heard one case of a 20-year-old girl who was burned alive because she refused to perform an extreme sex act. We learned of many other sadistic sexual acts.'
The video of destroyed buildings emerged just hours after Syrian regime warplanes carried out intense strikes on ISIS targets within Palmyra in an attempt to force the terrorists out of the strategically important desert city.
Within days of ISIS capturing Palmyra, hundreds of locals were brutally executed - among them at least 67 civilians, including 14 children.
Hundreds more were imprisoned by the Islamic terrorists.
Yesterday the Syrian Air Force announced that it had carried out a series of raids on ISIS targets within the militant-held city.
'The air force struck more than 160 Daesh targets, killing and wounding terrorists and destroying weapons and vehicles equipped with machine guns' on Palmyra's outskirts and elsewhere in the east of Homs province, the source said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS.
'We are pursuing Daesh wherever they are,' he added.
'Military operations, including air raids, are ongoing in the area around Al-Suknah, Palmyra, the Arak and Al-Hail gas fields and all the roads leading to Palmyra,' he said.
State television said more than 50 ISIS terrorists had been killed in the Palmyra air strikes so far.

The clip begins by showing a bustling street inside ISIS-held Palmyra, with locals going about their business
Sickening: A picture sent by activists to a Western journalist shows a row of men lying in pools of blood in a street in Palmyra last week. At least four of the men had been decapitated
The regime airstrikes are understood to have targeted several areas of the city, including some close to the city's famed Greco-Roman ruins, a UNESCO world heritage site.
But so far they had failed to halt the jihadists, who advanced towards the capital Damascus and overran major phosphate mines about 45 miles south of Palmyra.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least four civilians had been killed in the regime air raids, which were the most intense since the jihadists overran the city last Thursday.
Dozens of people had also been wounded in the raids, and IS was believed to have taken losses when a military security building was hit, said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman.
'IS has made further progress on the Tadmor-Damascus highway and grabbed the Khnaifess phosphate mines and nearby houses,' said the Observatory, which relies on a network of sources on the group for its reports.
'It has extended its control over larger areas and even greater economic interests,' added the monitor.

A child who was filmed being dragged around on a leash by his mother in the Philippineshas been taken into care after there was an online backlash  when she posted the footage online.
The woman handed herself in to social services when Facebook users lambasted her over the horrifying images, in which the naked young boy is crouched over a bowl of what appears to be dog food.
The photos were spotted by child abuse campaigner Lurleen Hilliard.
Lurleen, 46, from Dublin, is the founder of Nolonger Victims, a global organisation that educates people on all forms of abuse and helps to protect and rescue victims.

She said: 'I was trawling through Facebook on Monday when I came across the images she had posted on her page.
'Initially I was infuriated and my blood was literally at boiling point. This cannot be tolerated.
'If we tolerate this level of abuse and parents think they can post these images online in order to boost their page or to make themselves look good then all we're doing is saying that we support, and we're enabling, child abuse.
'What made me more concerned was if this is what she's happy to post on Facebook then what is she doing behind the scenes that nobody knows about? This is what she's willing to show us, what isn't she willing to show us?'
Lurleen alerted some law enforcement contacts in the US, who got in touch with counterparts in the Philippines.
She was told Tuesday morning that the mother had been taken into care.

'The state government has taken up education programmes through television and other media to tell people not to venture into the outside without a cap, to drink water and other measures,' said P. Tulsi Rani, special commissioner for disaster management in the state.
'We have also requested NGOs and government organisations to open up drinking water camps so that water will be readily available for all the people in the towns.'
In Telangana state, which borders Andhra Pradesh in the south, 231 people have died in the last week as temperatures hit 48 degrees Celsius over the weekend.
In the western state of Orissa 11 people were confirmed to have died from the heat.
Another 13 people have died in the eastern state of West Bengal, where unions urged drivers in the city of Kolkata to stay off the roads during the day.

Most of the deaths have occurred among labourers and construction workers who are badly affected by the heat, (pictured, workers sit in the shade in New Delhi during the heatwave)
Also badly affected are the young and very old, especially in poor districts where they are unable to cool their homes (pictured, and old lady cools herself using a fan as a young girl plays outside her home in Kolkata)

Hyderabad street vendor P. Gangamma said the heat was making her head pound, but she had no choice but to stay outside.
'For the past three days hot wind has been coming in,' said the 65-year-old, who sells cigarettes on a busy intersection. I am a diabetes patient, but I have no husband and no sons, so I have to stay here and keep shop.'
Delhi street food vendor Hari Om said business was slow, with few people venturing out in the furnace-like conditions.
'All the food is getting spoilt even though I prepared it fresh in the morning. It's bad business, but what to do? People are not coming out and they don't feel like eating. All they want is to sip cold water all day.'
Widespread powercuts are expected to follow in the wake of the heatstroke deaths, as power-consuming air conditioning units are turned on en-mass.
India's power industry has long struggled to meet rapidly rising demand in Asia's third largest economy, with poorly maintained transmission lines and overloaded grids.
The Hindustan Times warned that some of the hot, dry conditions could plunge the worst-affected states into drought before monsoon rains arrive.
The monsoon is forecast to hit the southern state of Kerala towards the end of this month before sweeping across the country, but it will be weeks before the rains reach the arid northern plains.
Following the deaths, officials now expect rolling blackouts as the country's power grid fails to keep with the demand from power-hungry air conditioning units (pictured, a woman hides from the sun inHyderabad)

Draft measures put forward this week encourage companies to shorten working hours and let employees make more use of annual vacation.
Proposals put forward by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to ban overtime pay for some white collar workers are also aimed at cutting the number of hours worked, but have come in for criticism.
While the set of laws aim to make hours more flexible, critics say they will not break the work-til-you-drop culture, and will only mean staff are underpaid, as well as overworked.

Working too much was deemed to have played a role in 2,323 suicides last year, which falls just short of 2011, when2,689 suicides were deemed to be work related.
More data released from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reveals that, as well as working more days than they have to, Japanese workers also stay in the office longer.
In 2014, full time workers spent an average of 173 hours working overtime, ministry data shows, which is the highest amount since 1993.
About 22.3 percent of Japanese employees work 50 hours or more each week on average, above 12.7 percent in Britain, and 11.3 percent in the United States according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
A Japanese government study found that 16 percent of full-time workers took no paid holidays in 2013, while others took just half their allotted vacation on average.

A three-year-old boy is fighting for his life in hospital after being crushed between two cars while on a family holiday.
The unattended car started rolling down a hill in a private car park at Glynn Barton Cottages near Bodmin, Cornwall, and careered into a parked car, trapping the toddler in the middle.
He was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth with life threatening injuries before being taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where he remains in a serious condition.
The toddler was crushed between two cars while on holiday with his parents at Glynn Barton Cottages (one of the cottages pictured) in Bodmin, Cornwall, on Friday
The boy, who has not been named, was on holiday with his parents from London when the incident happened at about 6pm on Friday.
Police are investigating the cause of the collision and whether a motorist left his handbrake on or whether the device itself failed and have spoken to both owners.
They added that the vehicle involved was a Vauxhall Astra, which is registered to an address in Liverpool, and rolled into a Range Rover, registered to an address in Warwickshire.
A spokesperson for Glynn Barton Cottages said: 'This is an ongoing police investigation and I am not willing to discuss it.'

Marie Morley, a former employee of Glynn Barton Cottages, who lives in Bodmin, Cornwall, said: 'I can't believe this has happened, I'm shocked.
'I used to work there, they are a lovely couple who own it, very considerate of children and always go the extra mile to make sure everything is safe.
'All I can say is that I am certain it would have had nothing to do with the owners, and that it is much more likely a guest who was careless.
'What happens is when visitors arrive they don't always see the car park, and just park where ever they see fit, and some places are very hilly.
'It is heartbreaking. I really hope the poor boy pulls through. I can't imagine what his parents must be feeling.'
The youngster was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth with life threatening injuries before being taken to Southmead Hospital in Bristol (pictured) where he remains in a serious condition
Another neighbour of the resort, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is absolutely terrible news and I really hope the boy is okay.'
All people involved were fellow holidaymakers although it is understood none of the vehicles belong to the boy's family.
A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said: 'Police received a report from ambulance crew that they were treating the boy on the outskirts of Bodmin near Glynn Barton.
'The child is thought to have been crushed between two parked cars on a private road.
'One of the vehicles rolled into the other, there is currently an investigation to establish exactly what happened.
'It happened on a private car park area where the family were holidaying.
'The boy, from London, was taken to Derriford Hospital with life threatening injuries. He was later transferred to Southmead Hospital in Bristol where he remains in a serious condition.'
Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident to come forward.
The holiday resort itself features eight 18th Century cottages (one of which pictured) set in 13 acres of tranquil countryside set in the heart of Cornwall
Police are investigating the cause of the collision at Glynn Barton Farm Cottages (pictured) and whether a motorist left his handbrake on or whether the device itself failed and have spoken to both owners
A seven-night stay at the resort, which features 18th century cottages in 13 acres of tranquil countryside with an indoor swimming pool, ranges from 900 to 1,300.
The site is approached by a long private drive two miles from the hamlet of Cardinham in North Cornwall.
On its website, the owners said they take great pride in their 'child friendly holidays'.
The site says: 'With children free to run around, parents are free to relax safe in the knowledge that the nearest public road is almost a mile away and in between is nothing but lovingly tended gardens, wonderful facilities and a host of friendly farm animals.'

Officers found CCTV at the premises which showed a total of four offenders angle grind the lock of the main gate off before one of them drove the lorry out of the yard.
The vehicle was discovered four days later in an industrial park in Eythorne, bearing false number plates.
A third theft took place six days later when the haulage yard in Lydden was targeted again.
Thieves broke into the premises and stole the keys to a lorry and its refrigerated trailer containing Toblerone chocolate worth 201,000.
It was driven to one of the suspects' home address and haulage yard in Tarleton, Lancashire where the trailer and its consignment of chocolate were moved on and the lorry, which had cloned number plates fitted before its journey north, was abandoned.
Jailed: Jeffrey Hamid, 31, (left) of Hargate Road, Liverpool, and John Dahl, (right) 44, of Aysgarth Avenue, Liverpool, were jailed for four years six months andfour years eight months, respectively, over the thefts
Officers found CCTV (pictured) at a haulage yard in Whitfield which showed a total of four offenders angle grind the lock of the main gate off before one of them drove the lorry out of the yard with 23,000 of whisky onboard
It was later found by police officers but the chocolate and the trailer have never been recovered.
Following the thefts, detectives found evidence that the gang had been travelling to and from Merseyside and Kent shortly before and after the offences had taken place, often in convoy.
Further evidence was uncovered on one of the suspect's mobile phones where he had stored pictures of the high value whisky stolen from the lorry in Dover in the first offence.
Search warrants were executed at various addresses in July 2014 linked to the offenders in Kent, Merseyside, Lancashire and North Wales.
A black balaclava and a signal jammer were seized at one address and at least four sim cards and several mobile phones were taken away and analysed at another location.
Gang: Lee Gilmore, 33, (left) of Sidney Powell Avenue, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to his role in the initial theft while Stuart Nicolson, 48, (right) of Whitfield, Dover, was found guilty by a jury of taking part
Following the thefts, police found evidence that the gang had been travelling to and from Merseyside and Kent shortly before and after the offences had taken place, often in convoy. CCTV was also used as evidence
Officers discovered handwritten lists of possible haulage targets.
Lee Henry Gilmore, 33, of Sidney Powell Avenue, Liverpool, pleaded guilty to his role in the initial theft while Graham Ascroft, 55, of Higher Lane, Holmes Tarleton, Preston, Lancashire, was found guilty by a jury.
Jeffrey Hamid, 31, of Hargate Road, Liverpool, John Dahl, 44, of Aysgarth Avenue, Liverpool and Darren John Michael Price, 39, previously of County Road, Kirby, Liverpool, all pleaded guilty to their roles in the theft of the 40,000 lorry.
Following a trial, Stuart Nicolson, 48, of Bindon Blood Road, Whitfield, Dover, was found guilty of taking part in the theft.
In one lorry thieves stole 23,000 worth of whisky
Gilmore, Price, Hamid and Dahl pleaded guilty to their roles in stealing the lorry and its consignment while Ascroft and Nicolson were found guilty following a trial.
Gilmore was sentenced to four years eight months imprisonment, Hamid to four years six months, Dahl to four years eight months in prison and Price was sentenced to four years eight months.
Nicolson was sentenced to four years and Ascroft to four years eight months imprisonment at Maidstone Crown Court in Kent.
Detective Sergeant Jon Saxby of Kent Police, who investigated the thefts, said after the sentencing: 'These sentences reflect the seriousness of these offences  organised, professional thieves who stole lorries and lorry loads to sell on.
'Ascroft, it appears, made the contacts to sell the haul on while Price and others travelled the country to target hauliers to steal the vehicles and the consignments.
'While this group made a quick sale, legitimate businesses and hauliers suffered greatly with property stolen, deliveries cancelled, excess payments on insurance and not to mention the inconvenience to their customers.
'The message is simple  if you commit crime in Kent, no matter where you are from, we will find you and we will bring you to justice.'

	Uncle Sam's Great American Circus motorcycle riders crash in Ipswich

	Miroslav Ivanob, 31, and Abraham Medina, 30, collided  during a performance of Uncle Sam's Great American Circus in a packed big top tent in Chantry Park, Ipswich, yesterday.

Circus worker Richard Mack said Mexican rider Mr Medina, who has been riding inside cages since the age of seven, had broken four ribs, whileBulgarian rider Mr Ivanob was left with swelling after a facial injury.
A brain scan showed he had not been seriously hurt.
Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Ivanob said: 'I don't remember how it happened. But I am feeling much better now. I hope to be out soon. Everything is going to be OK.'
This is the moment the two motorcyclists (pictured left during the act) crashed into each other in mid-air while riding at up to 60mph as part of a Wall of Death-style stunt and fell to the floor of the metal cage (right)
The accident happened around 30 seconds into their act during a performance of Uncle Sam's Great American Circus in a packed big top tent in Chantry Park, Ipswich, yesterday
Mr Mack said Mr Ivanob, who has been riding in cages for four years, was hoping to leave hospital tonight or tomorrow to re-join the circus.
He added: 'It is not the first time they have crashed, but this accident is the most serious. There is always a risk with an act like this.
'They need split second timing to pass each other safely and if one is a bit faster than the other then accidents can happen.
'Later on in the act they would have been joined by a third rider in the cage. Neither of them lost consciousness.
The male riders had been taking part in the stunt, which involved them defying gravity to circle around the cage
Shocked audience members saw the bikes come together, before the riders fell to the floor, their bikes landing on top of them
A circus publicity photograph shows the stunt being performed successfully, this time by three bikes
'The hospital was worried that Miroslav might have broken a cheek bone, but an X-ray showed it was fine. A brain scan was also fine.
'Both of them should be out of hospital soon, but the circus will not press them to start riding again until they are ready.'
Mexican rider Mr Medina, who has been riding inside cages since the age of seven, had broken four ribs
The accident happened 30 seconds into their gravity-defying Thunderball act yesterday, with videos taken by members of the audience showing Mr Ivanob and Mr Medina passing repeatedly just inches apart before finally hitting each other while they were upside down.
The soundtrack of War of the Worlds carried on playing as worried staff rushed into the globe, while the shocked audience of around 500 people screamed in horror.
Staff appealed for help from anyone with medical training at the show and a member of the audience went to assist the pair.
They were treated by paramedics at the scene before being taken by road ambulance to Ipswich Hospital.
An East Anglia Air Ambulance helicopter was also scrambled to the circus, but was not needed to take the men to hospital.
An East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said one rider suffered head injuries and the other had upper body and leg injuries.
The spokesman added: 'Both were fully conscious and neither were critical. Neither are thought to be in a life-threatening situation.'
The show which had gone for just 20 minutes was abandoned after the accident and members of the audience were given half their money back.

Mr Ivanob, who has been riding in cages for four years, is hoping to leave hospital tonight or tomorrow to re-join the circus, according to a staff member
Michael Nanton, 49, who was at the circus with his partner Sue Padmore, 51, of Ipswich, said: 'It was scary to see it happen.
'The bikes crashed, the motorcyclists fell and landed underneath the bikes.
Mr Ivanob (pictured) and his colleague are now recovering from the crash
'The organisers asked if anyone in the audience had medical training or was a paramedic to assist them.
'We were evacuated straight away and they gave people half their money back.'
An eyewitness, who was at the circus with his fianc and five-year-old daughter, added: 'Lots of people with kids were left shocked and upset, especially the children.'
Another spectator was sitting with her six-year-old niece and friend as the drama unfolded.
She said: 'I was sitting in the rear view block and saw everything. 'My niece was scared but we reassured her.
'There were people crying outside the big top. It's just not what you expect when you go to the circus.'
The circus posted a statement on its Facebook page saying: 'To all our audience from the 4.30pm show today, we would just like to thank you all for your support during the accident with our thunderball riders.
'We have just had an update from Ipswich Hospital and both are doing well and stable, soon to be on the mend.
'We want to thank you for your understanding as we had to cut short the show. However our riders' safety was, and is, our main priority.
'We will pass on all your kind words and well wishes and keep all posted on any updates.'
A spokesman for Ipswich Borough Council, which operates Chantry Park, said: 'We are aware of this horrible accident and we wish those involved a full recovery.'
A Suffolk police spokesman said officers were called to the circus by the ambulance service just after 5pm on Monday.
Mr Ivanon said he did not remember how the accident happened, but added: 'I am feeling much better now'

	Shi'ite militia and Iraq army launches bid to take back Ramadi from ISIS

Iraqi forces closed in on Ramadi today and launched an operation aimed at cutting off the jihadists in Anbar province before a major offensive to retake the city.
The operation will see a mix of security forces and paramilitaries move south towards the city from Salaheddin province, he added.
Iraqi fighters from the Shi'ite popular mobilisation units fire their guns against Islamic State militants on the outskirts of Baiji refinery north of Tikrit. A mix of security forces and paramilitaries have moved south across Salaheddin province in anan operation aimed at taking back the city of Ramadi from the terror group
Iraq announces operation to liberate Anbar province
The Hashed al-Shaabi ('popular mobilisation' in Arabic) is an umbrella group for mostly Shi'ite militia and volunteers, which the government called in after ISIS captured Ramadi on May 17.
'The operation's goal is to liberate those regions between Salaheddin and Anbar and try to isolate the province of Anbar,' Assadi told AFP news agency.
He said it had been dubbed 'Operation Labaik ya Hussein', which roughly translates as 'we are at your service, Hussein' and refers to one of the most revered imams in Shi'ite Islam.
The Hashed said 4,000 men were heading to the northern edge of Ramadi.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and his US allies had been reluctant to deploy Iran-backed Shi'ite militia in Anbar, a predominantly Sunni province.
Tehran, the main backer of the paramilitary groups that were sent to Anbar's rescue, was gloating about its influence today, suggesting that Washington that was indecisive in its approach to ISIS.
'How can you be in that country under the pretext of protecting the Iraqis and do nothing?
'This is no more than being an accomplice in a plot,' said General Qassem Suleimani, the Revolutionary Guards' commander of foreign operations.

Trail of destruction: Iraqi fighters from the Shi'ite popular mobilisation unit walk past a damaged vehicle in the outskirts of Baiji refinery north of Tikrit, in the Salahaddin province, during a joint operation with the Iraqi army to retake the remaining area of the oil refinery from Islamic State  jihadists
Meanwhile, rare footage emerged today that claimed to show U.S. special forces helicopters on operations north of Baiji.
Aviation blogger David Cenciotti, who shared the video online, said it revealed a formation of four U.S. MH-60 and two MH-47E helicopters followed by two more Black Hawks, flying at very low altitude.
Writing on The Aviationist , he claimed they belonged to the U.S. Armys 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, known as 'Night Stalkers', which was involved in a raid to kill high-level ISIS commander Abu Sayyaf in eastern Syria.
The footage was reportedly filmed by Iraqi forces.

Anbar's provincial capital Ramadi had resisted ISIS assaults for more than a year but fell earlier this month after a massive jihadist offensive and a chaotic retreat by security forces.
The Islamic State group controls most of Anbar, a huge province which borders territory also under its control in neighbouring Syria.
Pockets of government control include some eastern areas near the capital, the city of Haditha, parts of the town of Al-Baghdadi and the Al-Asad air base, where hundreds of US military advisers are stationed.
Regular forces and Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitaries also made progress south and west of Ramadi, an army lieutenant colonel told AFP, and retook an area called Al-Taesh.
'The Iraqi security forces and Hashed al-Shaabi have now cut off all supply routes for ISIS in Ramadi from the south,' provincial council member Arkan Khalaf al-Tarmuz said.
Over the past week, ISIS is likely to have built up its defences by rigging much of Ramadi with explosives, the jihadist group's weapon of choice.
Destruction wrought on Ramadi by ISIS fighters
Gloating: Feared Iranian General Qassem Suleimani (left), who is co-ordinating the various Shi'ite militias in Iraq, has likened the U.S. to an 'accomplice' after accusing Washington of inaction in its role against ISIS
Washington on Monday moved to appease Baghdad after Iraq's leadership reacted angrily to comments by the Pentagon chief accusing Iraqi forces of 'lacking the will to fight'.
Ashton Carter's remarks to the CNN news channel were widely perceived as unfair in Iraq, where some forces have put up valiant resistance to ISIS assaults.
In a call to Abadi, the White House quoted Vice President Joe Biden as saying he 'recognised the enormous sacrifice and bravery of Iraqi forces over the past 18 months in Ramadi and elsewhere.'
The US-led coalition has carried more than 3,000 strikes against IS targets in Iraq and Syria over the past 10 months.
Baghdad and Washington had boasted that ISIS was a waning force after months of territorial losses but the fall of Ramadi signalled that the jihadist group may have been written off too soon.
Its seizure of the city prompted 55,000 residents to flee their homes, according to the United Nations.
Many of them have been prevented from crossing into other provinces, for fear they have been infiltrated by ISIS fighters.
Some Sunni Arab politicians and activists have described the move as unconstitutional and discriminatory against the minority community.
The International Rescue Committee said the restriction was forcing some people to return to conflict areas.
'Thousands of people fleeing Ramadi are stuck at checkpoints or being denied entry to safe areas,' IRC's Syrian crisis response regional director, Mark Schnellbaecher, said.
'For some people the situation has become so hopeless that they are returning to the conflict in Ramadi.'

	Sunderland girl Sarah Clerkson found hanged at house party

	Sarah Clerkson, pictured, was drinking heavily and was 'very drunk' at a house party in Spennymore, Co Durham on the night she died in December 2013, according to an inquest into the schoolgirl's death.

Attempts were made to revive her and an ambulance was called but she could not be saved.
Asked by the coroner about Sarah's drunkenness, Ms Tinkler replied: 'From the accounts of the young people present, they described her as very drunk.'
She agreed when Mr Tweddle said there was no indication of 'unpleasantness' or bullying at the party, which he said was a 'happy occasion where there has been lots of alcohol consumed'.
Sarah was taken to the University Hospital of North Durham (pictured) where she later died
Earlier, her foster father told the inquest Sarah had been living with them since the October.
Mr Young agreed when Mr Tweddle said: 'It is clear... that Sarah had had quite a troubled time in the weeks, months and possibly years prior to coming to you.'
She had a history of absconding from home before staying with the Youngs, but the foster father said he was only late home once, briefly, while staying with them.
Their aim was to give her a stable, family life with routines, the inquest heard.
Mr Young said: 'I thought she was getting better, I thought it was extremely positive.'
He added: 'She was really bubbly, polite and friendly.'
But there were issues at school, he said. And, although she befriended a lot of children, there were 'bad influences', Mr Young said.
Sarah Clerkson (pictured), originally from Sunderland, went to sleep after she was sick and party-goers found her an hour later in the bedroom
She had been exposed to drink and drugs previously, the inquest heard, and Mr Young was aware of that.
'But she never displayed anything when she was with us,' he said.
'We wanted her to do hobbies and activities and things that would take her mind off the bad situation she had been in in the past. We took her to college open days to see the possibilities if she stayed with us.'
On the day she died, Mr Young said all communication with her foster family had been positive.
That night she went out with a female friend who took her to a party with around 12 teenagers aged 14-17, the inquest heard. She was expected to be home for 10pm.
Notepads and books she wrote in were examined after her death, and although she had mentioned self-harm in the past, there was no mention of suicide, Mr Tweddle said.
To give a conclusion of suicide, the coroner said he would have to be sure she intended to kill herself. He could not be certain, due to her drunkenness, her age and a lack of a note or other indicators.
'She might have done, but might is not enough,' he said. 'I do have reasonable doubt in my mind. Sarah is entitled to the benefit of that doubt, therefore I will not say that she committed suicide.'
He added: 'The appropriate conclusion is an open one.'
Sarah's family were aware of the inquest but chose not to attend, Mr Tweddle said.
A review by Sunderland Safeguarding Children Board will be published in the coming weeks.
An inquest for Danielle Formosa, also 14 and from Sunderland and who knew Sarah, will be held before the same coroner on June 1. She was also in care and died at a County Durham children's home days after Sarah was found

	Scores of parents have complained about Margam Country Park's Bank Holiday Superhero Family Fun Day, in Wales claiming it was poorly run and a 'rip- off'.

'There was nothing to do outside the castle - it was a half an hour wait just to get into the gift shop. And we only saw three characters - Elsa, Anna and Wonder Woman who was an absolute state.
'My son was really looking forward to seeing Spiderman but we saw no sign of him.'
'We used to go to Margam quite often but lately they've gone terrible.'
Emily Ward, who is eight months pregnant, said she felt 'disgusted by the whole event'.
'I desperately needed the toilet and had to wait in line, even when I got to the front people were so desperate to get in they pushed me back out of the door. I gave up in the end and had to go to the toilet in some bushes.
'I'm still shocked, the day after that I lost my human right to use a toilet. Utterly disgusted.

Kayleigh Foley with 18-month-old son Oscar-Jay, and their friend's daughter Nia, 8, pose with 'Olaf' at the event
Queues of cars line up just to get into the event which parents have slammed as disorganised
Motorists clogged up the roads around the event on the Bank Holiday as parents claim there were no staff members on hand to organise the chaos
'I think the kids had more fun in McDonald's on the way home than here. My nephews are big fans of superheroes, they were just let down. We can usually make the best of a bad situation but not this time.'
Hours-long queues for the castle meant many did not make it inside and so they said they barely saw any superheros or Disney film characters.
Others complained over the quality of some of the costumes.
Writing on the event's Facebook page, Katie O'Donoghue said: 'Basically went there and paid 19 to glimpse a shoddy Olaf walking around. Really badly organised and a total waste of our Bank Holiday and money.'
Alexandra Jones added: 'Absolutely disgusted with the event. Hours and hours of queues. Only a couple of toilets, hardly anything to do. Complete chaos.
'Left after an hour for how rubbish it was. I will be asking for a refund tomorrow. Very disappointed children and there were 100s of families leaving.'
By 11am traffic cameras reported queueing traffic on the M4 at the exit for Margam with congestion back onto the main carriageway. Traffic snarls continued for several hours.
In the evening police were forced to close the A48 in both directions to allow motorists to leave Margam Park after the event ended.
The event, which ran from 11am until 4pm, included a Frozen sing-along and promised families meet-and-greets with Olaf, Spiderman and other superheroes. A family ticket cost 19.
Emma Mitchell-Williams said: 'Such a disappointing day. Took an hour to get to pay. We arrived at 10am (and) stood in line for 45 minutes so my niece could have her face painted. Was told they were short staffed so someone painted her face blue for 3.50.
Hundreds of children were left in tears when they had to stand in mile long queues to meet Olaf the snowman, Princess Elsa, Spiderman and Wonder Woman

Sadly many didn't get a chance to meet the two performers as queues were too long to get inside the castle
'Queued for 1 1/2hrs to see Elsa to be told it was ticket only. Very few 'superheroes' around. We had three toilet stops all 45 minutes each!
'We would have complained on the way out but guess what: there was a queue! A complete waste of 12 and a two-hour round trip!'
Carly Saunders said: What an awful 'fun day'. Queue after queue! Queued for over an hour at one point &amp; I don't even know what for!! What a shambles, my 3 year old has better organisation skills than whoever dreamed up this mess!'
Davina Hollisey-Mclean added: 'Absolute rip off. Queued for an hour to see Elsa. Seeing the organisation at the park was a disgrace.'
Hayley Rees Moon said: 'I've been to a few events in my time both working and as a customer and this has to be the worst organised one I've ever gone too. Crikey I could have done better.
'Toilets - disgusting, dirty, smelly, no loo roll, queues. Where were the extra portaloos for over 10,000 people.
'Super heroes - what super heroes? We didn't see any, didn't see any signs. The customers did better in their own outfits.'
Two of the characters at the event - Anna and Elsa from Frozen- pose in front of the castle at Margam Country Park
Families complained that there was little to do for the little ones outside of the castle
Others mocked the 'horrendous' costumes on the day which was attended by an estimated 1,100 people
Many of the visitors said they felt the day was saved by the efforts of some parents who dressed up as superheroes and were happy to pose for pictures.
One visitor, support worker Katherine Foley, 37, from Neath, Wales, had visited the event with her daughter Kayleigh and grandson 18-month-old Oscar-Jay, and taken their friend's daughter Nia, 8.
'I think, all in all, we saw one superhero and he was just disappearing into the castle.
'My grandson is 18 months old and we had to change nappy on the grounds because the queues for the toilet were so long.
'There were no superheros around - the only one we sayw in the grounds was Olaf. You had to queue to get into the castle - which stretched right down the grounds.
'We even paid an extra 2 for fast track tickets to do the Frozen meet and greet but my grandson didn't even get to meet them.
'My daughter said the costumes of the ones inside were horrendous. They didn't wear the costumes they wore in the show.
'I'm phoning up for a full refund today.
'The parents that dressed up got more attention than the people who worked there. Children were having their photos taken with them. They really saved the day.
'They always have big events on here - last Bank Holiday they had a dragon event - so I can't understand why this was such a shambles.
'On the leaflet they said they had 19 characters. We didn't see Spiderman, we didn't see Batman, we saw Captain America but he was rubbish.
Many of the visitors said they felt the day was saved by the efforts of some parents who dressed up as superheroes and were happy to pose for pictures
The Hulk, aka parent Gavin Harrison, was popular with the crowds and was happy to pose for pictures - despite the fact he himself had to pay to enter the event
'The costumes these kids had on looked like something cheap you might buy from a fancy dress shop, orsomethingthey'd thrown together themselves.
'They were just running up and down, they weren't interacting withthekids. It was awful.'
Ellie Reid added: 'I was at Margam yesterday with my husband, 4 year old and 2 year old boys.
'We queued for an hour and 20 minutes to meet Captain America, Spiderman, Ironman and Batman.
'The queues for food were so long we all had a packet of Monster Munch for lunch.'
However, one father has defended the day claiming parents were over-reacting.
'Me and my family went to the event in Margam Park and in a way I agree it was very busy but it was mainly for the kids and i think some parents are making it a bigger deal than it was,' saidJustyn Hart.
'The look on my two-year-old sons face when he met his hero Spiderman was the highlight of our day, despite the fact it was a man dressed up, it was mainly all for him.
'It was a nightmare to get out of the car park at the end but it wasn't a major issue as some made it out to be.'
Craig Hulland added: 'Some of you people need to get it grip. Granted the organization was poor, but I had a sweet time spending time with my family. I read that some people were q ing and didn't know what they were q ing for. Come on, man!!!
'I didnt q and my boy saw all superheroes, and best part was seeing so many kids climbing trees and flying kites as spiderman, iron man and even the flash, and having a sweet time.
'Seriously, it ain't universal studios!!! If u spent most of ur day moaning, then no wonder the kids has bad experience (sic).'
Along side the superhero event was a kite festival with kite flyers from around the UK and a couple from Europe' (pictured is Fat Fury' aka Guy Reynolds who is one of the UK's top kite designers)
The kite show was praised but visitors complained there wasn't more interaction with the children
Cartoon Mascots RTC owner Lanleigh Payne, which organised the event at Margam Country Park (pictured) said families had been warned queues would be long
The company who provided 'some of the superheroes' yesterday defended the event.
Cartoon Mascots RTC owner Lanleigh Payne, who was not present at the event, said families had been warned queues would be long.
He added: 'From our point of view it was well organised. We were booked months in advance. I can't comment on the other complaints, all we supplied were some of the superheroes.'
A spokesman for Neath Port Talbot Council who run Margam Park: 'Whilst we anticipated a good attendance for the superheroes event and had planned in advance for a busy day the numbers who attended was unprecedented for the park.
'The previous highest bank holiday attendance was on Easter Monday 2015 when 5,500 people visited the park. Yesterday saw approximately 13,000 visitors.
'The park is aware that there were issues with traffic congestion but rather than close the gates and possibly compromise safety, our priority was to clear the M4 tailback as quickly as possible and the best way to do this was to continue to allow the flow of traffic into the park.
'As with all events we review the day to see what can be learnt.
'Yesterday's event did not go as we would have wished and we'd like to apologise to those visitors who did not have a good experience.
'We very much value the support of our regular visitors and any visitor to yesterday's event who feels that they are entitled to a refund can write to the park, enclosing their original ticket or till receipt, by the end of the week, and each case will be considered on merit'.

Pope Francis also claimed he hasn't watched TV since 1990 after making a promise to the Virgin Mary.
The Pope said that he didn't even watch the matches of his football team San Lorenzo de Almagro back in Buenos Aires.
Instead, he got a Swiss Guard to update him regularly on match results and league table positions.
He said there was no particular reason for his vow he simply decided: 'It's not for me.'
Humbling moment Pope Francis washes prisoners' feet
People person: Pope Francis says he would make a 'lousy monk' because he needs to be around others
He said: 'I have not watched TV since 1990. It's a promise that I made the Virgin of Carmen on the night of 15 July 1990. I told myself: "It's not for me".'
The Pope said that he doesn't surf the internet either and reads only one newspaper for ten minutes in the morning.
Francis, who has kept up a whirlwind of work since his election two years ago, has previously claimed that he has not had a holiday since 1994.
But he acknowledged  that the workload was taking its toll.
He admitted: 'I am under pressure. All those in government are under pressure. At the moment I feel the workload.
'I have a strong pace of work at the moment  it's the end of the school year syndrome with the focus on getting everything done before the end of June.
'There are a thousand things to be done and there are problems.'
Francis claimed that he had never dreamed of being popenor had he dreamed of being president or an army general.
Since accepting the role, he missed being able to walk in the streetand go for a pizza.
'Take-away is not the same,' he said. 'You have to go there.'

	Katie Sims and her husband Ben travelled to a five-star resort in the Dominican Republic for their dream wedding, however, more than half of their party of 20 were struck down by illness.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>26 shares
Now the couple have complained to holiday firm Thomson with whom they booked the trip.
Self employed cleaner Katie, 26, said: 'It was so hot out there we spent most of the time in the pool.
'I started feeling ill about two days in to the trip.
'My stomach wasn't great.
'But by the morning of the wedding I had projectile vomiting and diarrhoea.
'I managed to get through the ceremony but was feeling awful.
'I went straight to my room after that.'
Almost all of the 20 members of the wedding party were struck down by illness at some stage during the trip
Such was the extent of the illness, Katie and Ben had to re-run their reception to get photographs
The couple had booked into the Riu Merengue resort, pictured, in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic
'I was very dehydrated and the hotel took three hours 45 minutes - after numerous phone calls - to bring water to my room.
'They apologised later and said they were busy.
'There was an infirmary at the hotel and I was then admitted to that for several hours, still in my wedding dress, while the medical staff gave me painkillers and tried to rehydrate me.
'My mother was ill a day into the holiday.
'Ben, my husband, was ill two days before we went home.
'They were feeling fine on the wedding day but came with me for support to the infirmary.
'I was diagnosed on site with an infection of my digestive system and severe diarrhoea.
'I was out on a drip and given two bags of saline to treat the dehydration, penicillin, anti sickness and tramadol for the pain.
'I was asked by the doctor as soon as she saw me if I was pregnant as my stomach had inflamed so much from being sick.
Mrs Sims' dream wedding was ruined after most of her friends and family were struck down by a bug
Mrs Sims, pictured said she and her husband have written to holiday company Thompson over their ordeal
'By this time the wedding reception had started and neither Ben, or my mum, who wanted to be with me, or I, were there.
'We'd hired a band and they were playing love songs without us even being there - it was awful.
'Over the course of the fortnight, 12 of our party were ill.'
The dejected couple staged a re-run of the wedding ceremony at the hotel on Monday April 27 for their guests, and so they could have decent photographs.
They then flew back to Gatwick on Wednesday April 29.
Katie added: 'Every girl from such a young age dreams of their wedding day.
'And so much planning goes into it and effort and money.
'You just want it to be absolutely perfect.
'Your wedding day is meant to be a dream but it really was more of a living nightmare.'
Thomson has been asked for a comment.

        <MainBody>Shoppers at a Tesco super market were stunned to discover a duck wearing a bow-tie sitting in the front seat of a car.
Crowds gathered around the strange sight, after the bird's owner went into the shop collect their shopping.
Even more bizarre, there was a dog also in the car, sitting in the back seat.

Twitter user Jenny Balfour-Paul spotted the duck sitting inside the car in Crediton, Devon on Saturday - and even more bizarrely, there was also a dog sitting in the back
As well as a dapper bow tie, the duck - which appeared happy - was sporting an identity tag round its neck
A crowd of people gathered around the Ford Ka for a closer look at the Indian Runner Duck
Twitter user Jenny Balfour-Paul, 60, of Crediton, Devon, spotted the strange sight in her home town on Saturday afternoon and posted the image online.
She said: 'I came out to the car park in Tesco and saw people looking at this car, laughing and then walking off.
'I strolled up and could not believe what I was seeing. I have a thing about ducks and am always attracted to them. I love things like this. It is so ridiculous.
'I just love absurd things. I hate shopping and supermarkets can be such boring places but seeing something as quirky as this really helps brighten up the whole experience.'
'The duck was obviously very well looked after. It had its own tartan seat. He was not the least bit shy.'
According to the RSPB, the bird is an Indian Runner Duck, 'with a rather fetching bow-tie'.

Jailed for three years: Christopher Henry Barker (pictured) stole almost 300,000 from his parents
A son has been jailed for three years after stealing almost 300,000 from his parents to pay off his debts after losing all his money to men he met through gay dating websites.
Christopher Henry Barker, 48, of Ripon, North Yorkshire, felt betrayed that they had ignored him after he advised them not to set up an amusement park at the familys arable farm.
He plundered 273,900 from their business and savings accounts and used it to pay off almost 250,000 in debt after being conned by men on gay dating websites,York Crown Court heard.
The court was told how Barker believed he was justified in taking the cash because he was in charge of the finances and day-to-day running of Barugh Farm in Ripon.
Chris Wood, prosecuting, said Barkers parents made him a partner in the business in 2009 and trusted him with taking care of its finances.
But he began to draw out ever-greater amounts, running up huge bills and using some of the money to pay off loans he had taken out in the companys name. Last May, his two-year ruse finally unravelled when his mothers bank card was declined during a shopping trip.
She checked their finances with her daughter and found the 130,000 business account had been wiped clean and just 5 remained from the 10,000 savings account, which Barkers parents planned to use as their pension.
Realising her sons cruel deception, his mother Hannah Barker, 74, cut him out of the business he had worked at altogether, despite him having been part of it since he was a teenager.
Controversial decision:Barker felt betrayed that his relatives had ignored him after he advised them not to set up an amusement park at the familys arable farm, Barugh Farm (above) in Ripon, North Yorkshire
When police arrived they found an apparent suicide note in which Barker criticised his family for the business decisions they had made and showed utter resentment towards his stricken father.

	Ted Dockray's family in Jermaine Beckford shirt snatching forgive Vickie Timbrell

	Schoolboy Ted Dockray (in yellow), eight,  managed to get his hands on Preston striker Jermaine Beckford's shirt, only for it to be taken from him by Vickie Timbrell, 31.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>'People have made me out to be an absolute idiot,' said Ms Timbrell.
'I will be speaking to the family, I actually know them, they're friends.'
She also wrote on Facebook: 'Can I just say thank you to everyone for all the support and texts. I'm not commenting on the c*** they've written because I'm taking this further.
Horrible moment woman snatches football shirt from young fan
The row began when Jermaine Beckford (pictured right) threw his shirt towards a group of children in the Wembley Stadiumstands. Ted Dockray can be seen wearing a yellow tee-shirt, and Ms Timbrell (dressed in pink) also reaches for the shirt
Ted manages to catch the Preston North End hat-trick hero's shirt, when he is approached by Ms Timbrell
'It's all wrong and twisted. My side of the story will soon come out.'
Ms Timbrell told the Manchester Evening News today that she had reported the incident, and subsequent abusive messages directed at her on social media to the police.
'Im going to leave it now. Ive reported it to the police - the whole thing,' she said.
A spokesman from Greater Manchester Police told MailOnline that the force was looking into whether a complaint had been made.
A spokesman from the Metropolitan Police, which covers Wembley, was unable to confirm whether Ms Timbrell had contacted them.
Beckford, a Jamaica international, has called for the woman to return the shirt to the eight-year-old boy.
Ted was said to be 'in bits' and ran towards his father Martin after Ms Timbrell appeared to grab the shirt for her daughter.
The family had gone to north-west London to watch his ten-year-old brother Leo play in a schools' championship, in which Ms Timbrell's son was also appearing.
Speaking briefly today, Mr Dockray confirmed his family knew Ms Timbrell.
Ms Timbrell (dressed in a pink top) then goes to grab the shirt from Ted as a steward intervenes
Ted, from Failsworth, Manchester, attended the game with his family and was said to be 'in bits'
Mr Dockray said: 'Her son was part of the school team that went down to play in the final.'
When Mr Dockray was asked if their children went to the same school, he replied: 'Yeah, they went down as the football team that played in the final see.'
When asked if Ms Timbrell had straightened everything out with the family, Mr Dockray replied: 'Yeah, more or less.'
Speaking at his home later today, Mr Dockray said Ms Timbrell did not deserve the abuse she was receiving on social media, and said he did not know what had happened to the shirt.
'It is to do with Preston North End and the football league and the lady, I don't know if she still has the shirt or has handed it back to Preston, I don't know,' he said.
'But she has got a young family herself and she doesn't deserve the abuse she is getting.
'We are not going to say anything, what happened happened and that's that.
Mr Dockray said he didn't know who had put the Gumtree advert up, and whether it had been real.
He said: 'I couldn't tell you, we left five minutes before the end of the game anyway. I don't know who put it on or whether it was real advert, or whether it was the real shirt or a fake shirt, I couldn't tell you.'
Mr Dockray added:'"Enough said really, I think it has blown over now.'
Yesterday, Ted's aunt Helen Dockray spoke of his sadness to the Lancashire Evening Post.
She said: 'Ted was clearly the last one to have his hands on that shirt. He would have worn it even if it was all sweaty and smelly. It is the happiness it would have brought the child that matters.'
Beckford, 31, who made history by becoming only the third player ever to score a hat-trick in a play-off final, said: 'It was intended as a goodwill gesture.
Ted (top right) ran towards his father Martin, as a smiling Ms Timbrell carries the shirt. Both families had gone to Wembley to watch their children play in a school's match before the play off final kick off

'I assumed it would go to a good home from someone who was able to enjoy the game. Hopefully, it will find its way back to the kid who caught it.'
The advert for the shirt was later posted from a Stretford address on Gumtree, but has since been removed. It is not known whether this was a genuine advert.
A spokesman from Preston North End said Beckford would be presenting Ted with his spare match shirt from the game on Friday, and the schoolboy would be taken on a stadium tour.
'The Club are fully aware of an incident in Sundays Play-Off Final win over Swindon Town involving Jermaine Beckfords match shirt,' Preston North End said in a statement.
'The Club have been in consultation with the Football League and the parents of the child who is alleged to have had the shirt taken from him as seen on television cameras covering the match.
'Please note, no one involved in this situation is connected with Preston North End in any way, shape or form.
'The people seated in the area of the incident attended the Play-Off Final as part of the League One Football League Kids Cup Final which was played earlier in the day.
'We are delighted to say that Jermaine is more than happy to sign and present the child involved with his spare match shirt from the game.
'The Club will also provide a stadium tour for the youngster.
'If the shirt that Jermaine wore is returned to us, we will of course present this to the child in question instead.
'The Club will not be commenting further on the matter at this time and would like the focus returned to Sundays fantastic achievement and building towards what will be an exciting season in the Championship.'
Olympic gold medal winning long jumper Greg Rutherford also waded into the row, saying he would like to give Ted one of his signed athletics vests.
The advert for the shirt was later posted from a Stretford address on classified website Gumtree for 1,500, but has since been removed. It is not known whether this was a genuine advert
He wrote on Twitter: 'I know it's not the same. But if anyone knows this boy I'd like to send him a signed vest.'
And Ted's mother Sarah said the brothers had a day out at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey today after Leo's team won his final.
The Lancashire Police football intelligence unit is believed to be looking into the case. 
It comes after a baseball supporter was caught catching a fly ball at a game on May 16 - and showed off by kissing her biceps as a group of boys stood nearby, disappointed that they had not caught the ball.
Eventually, the Kansas City Royals fan turned and gave it away to a boy wearing a white jersey and mitt - but later in the game, cameras caught her calling out over the aisle: 'Give me my ball back!'

	Chinese lets ONE MILLION bees swarm over his body for world record

	Bee-lover Gao Bingguo, from Tai'an in China's northern Shandong province, smashed the previous world record by allowing a skin-crawling 109kg (240lb) of bees swarm over his body.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
172 shares
But with more than 60 test runs already under his belt, Gao was well-prepared for the official attempt.
The almost 1.1 million bees came to a total weight of 109.1kg, smashing the previous record of just 85.5kg.
After the world record attempt Gao is checked for stings and any remaining bees on his body. He was stung around 2,000 times in the attempt
Gao was actually reclaiming his place at the top, as his previous record attempt - set in June 2014 - had been beaten by another bee fanatic
Each kilo of weight amounts to around 10,000 bees.
After shedding his bee jacket, Gaos body temperature had reached a dangerous 60 degrees Celsius but he was still delighted with his success.
For such an apparently niche world record, the number of bees on a human body is surprisingly keenly-contested.
Assistants dump boxes of bees onto Gao for the world record attempt. Gao has been keeping bees for more than 35 years and is known as the 'Bee King' of Taishan, his home district
In fact, Gao was simply reclaiming the world record after his previous best  set last June  was broken by another bee fanatic.
But in his last attempt  also held in Taian - he only reached 326,000 bees, which fell well short of this week's effort.
Last May another bee-keeper named Ruan Liangming set the separate  but equally skin-crawling  record for the longest time spent cloaked in bees.
Ruan managed to stay in his bee suit for a whopping 53 minutes and 34 seconds.
Although bees are not naturally aggressive and dont sting unless provoked, a couple of thousand stings can be seen as an occupational hazard for bee-lovers like Gao and Ruan.
A total of 20 fellow beekeepers arrived armed with 30 hives full of bees, to cover Gao from head to toe - except for his nose and mouth

A sex scandal and expenses claims were deleted from the Wikipedia pages of MPs from computers inside the House of Commons before the election.
More than a dozen MPs' entries were edited from computers traced back to Parliament in the run-up to May 7, including details of Conservative Craig Whittaker's arrest and fellow Tory Stewart Jackson's habit of using 'chauffeur-driven cars'.
Anyone can make changes to pages on the Wikipedia site, but a record is made of the Internet Protocol (IP) address - a unique numbered code of the computer used.
The Wikipedia pages of Labour's Geraint Davies (left) and Tory backbencher Bob Blackman (right) were both edited from computers inside the Commons before the election
Details of expenses claims were deleted from Joan Ryan's (left) page, while references to Craig Whittaker's (right) arrest were removed. He was later released without charge
IP addresses are unique identifying codes assigned to every computer, and this is how the edits were linked back to the Commons.
An investigation by the Daily Telegraph found changes were made persistently on certain MPs' biographies, suggesting deliberate efforts were made to hide information before polling day.
The changes were made across the political spectrum, with Conservative and Labour MPs affected.

Tory backbencher Robert Blackman's entry was edited so all links to news stories about an 11-year affair were erased, it was reported.
The MP's affair is said to have started with fellow councillor Carol Shaw just a year after he married his wife Nicola, when all three of them worked for Brent Council in north London.
Ms Shaw accused him of hypocrisy in 2012 after he campaigned to safeguard marriage betweenone man and one woman.
Caroline Dinenage's (left) entry was edited from someone in Westminster to remove details of her voting against gay marriage, while local newspaper criticism was removed from Gavin Barwell's (right)
Conservative Craig Whittaker's entry was also edited to remove any mention of his arrest for allegedly assaulting his son in 2012, the newspaper reported.
Mr Whittaker was later released without charge.
Labour's Geraint Davies spent 2,285 on his kitchen and 1,500 on his living room on expenses, but all references to this were seemingly removed from his Wikipedia page.
Enfield North MP Joan Ryan's page is also said to have had details of her expenses claims deleted. Ms Ryan - who lost her seat in 2010 but won it back earlier this month - was criticised for spending thousands on refurbishing her home before 'flipping' it to another property.
HOW EDITS WERE TRACED BACK TO HOUSE OF COMMONS COMPUTERS
Anyone can edit a Wikipedia page, but when they do, an IP (Internet Protocol) address 'signature' is left behind.
Every computer has an IP address - a numbered code used to identify PCs.
Using this information, the source of any edits to Wikipedia pages can be traced.
Her Wikipedia page was even changed to remove claims Commons computers had been used to edit her profile.
Former Conservative minister Stephen Hammond frequently used chauffeur-driven cars while in government but this information was removed from his page.
Meanwhile fellow Tory Stewart Jackson's page appeared to have lost all details of how David Cameron was 'appalled' by Conservative expenses claims.
The biography of Gavin Barwell, also a Conservative MP, was changed to drop allegations by a local newspaper of 'persistent attempts at headline-grabbing'.
Earlier this month, the Sunday Times reported that Equalities Minister Caroline Dinenage's entry was edited from someone in Westminster to remove details of her voting against gay marriage.
A spokesman for the MP for Gosport said she was 'unaware' who had made the changes but said some of the edits contained 'inaccuracies'.
Mr Blackman and Mr Whittaker declined to comment.The other MPs have been contacted for comment.
THE EXACT CHANGES MADE TO MPS' PAGES FROM WITHIN PARLIAMENT
Stephen Hammond: Conservative MP for Wimbledon and junior transport minister
Removed: 'In spite of his keenness for sports, he does not particularly like walking. He has recently been revealed as one of the most frequent users of the chauffeur-driven cars which carry ministers or their red boxes across the UK, according to official documents. This is in spite of the fact he lives a mere six miles from Westminster.'

Joan Ryan: Labour MP for Enfield North
Removed: 'In May 2009, it was reported that Ryan had claimed more than 4,500 under the Additional Costs Allowance for work on a house she had designated as her second home. In February 2010, based on an audit report looking into the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal, Ryan was asked to repay 5,121 mortgage interest.'
Also removed: 'In 2012, The Independent reported that "[a]t least 10 attempts have been made from computers in Parliament to remove information about [Ryan's] expenses claims and a further 20 efforts to delete the information, some from her constituency of Enfield, have also been recorded in Wikipedia's logs. The sustained effort has proved successful and there is now no mention of Ms Ryan's Parliamentary expenses on her Wikipedia page."'
Joan Ryan's page was changed to remove details of her expenses claims - as well as comments on Commons computers being used to edit her Wikipedia page

Craig Whittaker: Conservative MP for Calder Valley
Removed:'In 2012, Craig Whittaker was arrester [sic] for assaulting his son in a petrol station.' He was later released without charge.'

Gavin Barwell: Conservative MP for Croydon Central
Removed:'The local paper the Croydon Advertiser called on Mr Barwell to "stop launching campaigns" and persistent attempts at headline-grabbing in December 2014, saying "Gavin, we get it, there's an election on."'

Geraint Davies: Labour MP for Swansea West
Changed from: 'According to the Daily Telegraph Davies spent 4,000 renovating his designated second home before losing his seat in 2005 - 2,285 on the kitchen two years before the election deadline and 1,500 on the living room expecting to be returned as an MP in 2005 having increased the Labour vote to 47.2% versus the Conservatives at 38.2%. It also claimed he was reimbursed for late night taxi fares which were not then permitted.'
To: 'The Telegraph claimed he spent 4,000 renovating his designated second home before the 2005 election - having increased the Labour vote to 47.2% versus the Conservatives at 38.2% in 2001, and that he was reimbursed for late night taxi fares before such claims were permitted.'
The WIkipedia page of Geraint Davies (pictured with Ken Livingstone) was edited to remove exact details of expenses claims

Stewart Jackson: Conservative MP for Peterborough
Removed: 'David Cameron, leader of Jackson's Conservative Party, declared himself appalled at the raft of revelations made by the Telegraph relating to claims submitted by some of his parliamentary party colleagues, and stated that disciplinary action could be taken against those who had acted illegally or outside of the rules.'

Robert Blackman: Conservative MP for Harrow East
Removed: 'Alex Wellman, "Caught with his pants down: Top Tory MP who praised sanctity of marriage had 11-YEAR AFFAIR", Daily Mirror, 15 December 2012.
'"Quote of the day: Bob was a terrible lover ...", London Evening Standard, 17 December 2012.'
DID GRANT SHAPPS DOCTOR WIKIPEDIA PAGES OF POLITICAL RIVALS?
Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps was accused of doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself weeks before the election
Former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps was accused of doctoring Wikipedia pages to promote himself at the expense of his political rivals just weeks before the General Election.
Mr Shapps, who is now Minister without Portfolio, denied the claims made in the Guardian, describing them as an extreme dirty tricks campaign.
Wikipedia suspended an anonymous user of the site, known only as Contribsx, after finding evidence it said suggested the account was run either by Mr Shapps or under his clear direction.
It cited a series of amendments made by the user to pages of the site, around one third of which involved removing embarrassing references on Mr Shappss own page.
Other changes included adding critical language to the pages of senior Tories including Justine Greening and election campaign chief Lynton Crosby.
The timing and content of some of the edits appear to tally with instances when Mr Shapps clashed with the subject of the changes.
The Tories described the story as completely false and defamatory.
Mr Shapps said: Its categorically untrue. Its absolutely nothing to do with me. Its just ridiculous. It looks like an extreme dirty tricks campaign designed to do anything but talk about policies.
But it emerged in 2012 that changes to Mr Shappss Wikipedia page were made from computers in his constituency office.
At the time, he said he had amended pages claiming he was a Jehovahs Witness, agnostic or crashed a car into a school wall.

The former marine would like to get a council house but has been told he has to wait to have his claim assessed by the local authority.
Mr McLaughlin has been offered temporary accommodation by Glasgow City Council but declined it as he wants something more permanent.
Mr McLaughlin was a royal marines commando for almost two decades and also served in the reserves for 19 years
He added: 'I just want to get somewhere settled so that I can leave work and know I've got somewhere to go.
'I got caught out one day and got soaked so I had to drive the car around with the heating on to dry off. When my car was in for an MOT I had to walk the streets.
'I sometimes go to a friend's house to get a shower. I can go to Wetherspoons for a meal and a drink for a fiver.
'If I'm on early shift I can eat at work, maybe have a bit of toast and a coffee.'
Mr McLaughlin said he would never forget friends he lost while fighting for his country, and is scarred by some of the memories.
He said: 'I lost a lot of pals in Afghanistan. Two of my best mates were killed by improvised explosive devices. Sometimes I get a bit emotional. It still hurts.
'We were the first ones in to Afghanistan. We had to drive from Kabul Airport to Bagram airbase in three vehicles.
'We had to clear a minefield when we got there. One guy was carrying two mines and lost both of his arms. I was 500 yards away.
'Then two Americans got off a helicopter and one of them stood on a mine and lost a leg. The other one died of shock.'
A spokesman said: 'Mr McLaughlin was offered temporary accommodation while we assessed his homelessness application but that accommodation was declined.
'We are making contact with Mr McLaughlin to repeat the offer of temporary accommodation.
'Under statutory rules, the council has 28 days to respond in writing to someone who has presented as homeless and we are still within that time limit.'

Chloe Stephenson, 21, was crowned Miss Swansea in 2012 (pictured) but was today found guilty of assault and given a suspended prison sentence
A 21-year-old beauty queen punched a woman in a ladies' toilet on a night out two years after she appeared in court for smashing a pint glass in another girl's face.
Chloe Stephenson, who was crowned Miss Swansea in 2012, has vowed to give up alcohol and stay out of trouble after a judge handed her a 12-month suspended prison sentence today.
A court heard Stephenson had been drinking in Swansea's Monkey bar in May last year when she assaulted her victim in the club's toilets.
Stephenson, who was in the final year of her degree course when the incident happened, denied the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, but was found guilty by a jury.
Ian Ibrahim, defending, said: 'Alcohol affects her and she has now almost completely stopped drinking.
'The incident took place over a year ago, and there has been nothing since.'
Judge Christopher Clee QC sentenced her to 12 weeks jail, suspended for 12 months at Swansea Crown Court.
He told her: 'It is not the first time you have been in trouble. You have a temper that you need to control.
'If you commit an offence within the next 12 months you will be brought back here, and you will be leaving through a different door.'
Today's ruling came two years after she was convicted of drunkenly attacking another young woman when she hit her in the face with a glass after a row broke out in the Wheatsheaf pub in in December 2011.
In that incident the aspiring social worker thought she recognised the girl, walked up to her but when she realised it wasn't who she believed it to be, an argument broke out.
The victim was left with a scratched cornea after the glass smashed into small fragments and she also had injuries to the left side of her face, under her eye and across her cheek and jaw.

	Fenton Hogan's grandmother says she will never forgive Kelly Emery

	Dudley toddler Fenton Hogan was two weeks away from his second birthday when he died of a methadone overdose. The drug was given to him by his addict mother Kelly Emery, 34.

Mrs Wheeldon first met heroin addict Emery after her son Michael Hogan, 31, began a  relationship with her.
Although aware of Emery's blighted childhood in the deprived Netherton area of Dudley, Mrs Wheeldon had no idea of the extent of her reliance on drugs.
'She was known for being out of control, and I thought she was bad news,' she explains. 'I didnt want Michael involved with her.'
Mr Hogan, 'no angel' according to his mother, had been in and out of trouble with police and Mrs Wheeldon had hoped a 'nice girl' might help him turn his life around.
Tragic: The little boy was two weeks shy of his second birthday when he died
Addict: Fenton's mother Kelly Emery, 34, was convicted of manslaughter in March and sentenced to six years behind bars for her crime
Emery, however, was not what she had in mind and Mrs Wheeldon admits she was initially reluctant to welcome her.
But when Emery became pregnant, the 52-year-old was forced to accept that she would now be a permanent part of the family.
'I tried my hardest to be supportive,' she says. 'Despite what I thought of Kelly, she was carrying my grandchild.
'I invited her round for hearty meals and made sure she was taking care of herself.'
Then came a bombshell. 'One day, when we at her antenatal class, she told me she had to have a meeting with her drug support worker.
'It was then I discovered that Kelly was a recovering heroin addict. She told me she was taking a small dose of the heroin substitute methadone.
'I was horrified - all I could think about was the impact this would have on the baby. She promised she was trying to sort herself out, and I believed her.
'I kept a close eye on her after that, took her to her scans and blood tests.'
For her part, Emery appeared to be making an effort to stay clean and promised to stay away from drugs once the baby was born.
Pleased with her progress, Mrs Wheeldon turned her attention to her son Mr Hogan and says she hoped becoming a father would result in a similar transformation in her son.
But it wasn't to be and shortly before the baby's birth, Mr Hogan was sentenced to three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for robbery.
'I was so disappointed in him,' she says. 'I [had] just hoped that being a dad would be the making of him.'
Determined to ensure he would still be part of the baby's life, Mrs Wheeldon began making regular visits to see him in prison and took newborn Fenton along.
Meanwhile, Emery was, says Mrs Wheeldon, 'good with her son' and appeared to be living up to her promise to stay away from drugs.
Imprisoned: Mrs Wheeldon with her son Michael, a convicted robber who was recently released from prison
Adorable: Mrs Wheeldon hoped baby Fenton would help son Michael turn his life around for the better
'Her house was clean and Fenton was always fed and happy,' she explains. 'I was sure her drug using days were over.'
Keen to help out, Mrs Wheeldon began to spend as much time as she could with her grandson - even taking him into her home at weekends in order to give his mother 'a break'.
'He was my world. I would have done anything for him,' she says. 'Hed stay every weekend and wed go out and feed the ducks and play with his cousins.
'He was never any trouble - he was my little angel.'
But unbeknown to Mrs Wheeldon, Emery had begun taking drugs again and had developed an addiction so powerful, it was described as being 'more important to her than her children' at her trial.
The first hint that something was wrong came shortly before Fenton's second birthday when a horrified Mrs Wheeldon discovered an unopened bottle of methadone stashed in his pushchair.
'I was furious with Kelly, but she tried to brush it off,' she says. 'As time went on I noticed Fenton was looking paler than usual.'
Much loved: Mrs Wheeldon says she adored her grandson and spent every weekend with him
Devastated: Mrs Wheeldon says she can never forgive Emery for what she did
Concerned that he wasn't being cared for properly, Mrs Wheeldon began sending him home after their weekends together with food packages filled with fruit and yoghurt.
Despite her worries, she gave Emery another chance and two weeks before his second birthday, Fenton was dropped off at Mrs Wheeldon's home for the weekend as usual.
Grandmother and grandson enjoyed a sunny Sunday together, feeding the ducks and playing on the trampoline before Mrs Wheeldon returned the toddler to his mother at 5pm.
The next morning, a call came from Emery's mother Angela to say Fenton had been admitted to Birmingham Children's Hospital.
Mrs Wheeldon and her husband Terry rushed to the hospital but, tragically, the little boy slipped away before they could say goodbye.
Emery was there too but showed no sign of emotion. 'Ill never forget her expression,' says Mrs Wheeldon. 'It wasnt that of a mother whose child had just died.
'She was questioned by the police while Terry and I were taken to see Fenton. He looked like he was sleeping.
'I couldnt help holding him. I told him that Nana loves him more than anything in the world.'
Post mortem toxicology reports revealed that the little boy had died from methadone poisoning while tests on his hair follicles showed he had been given the drug on at least two more occasions.
A heartbroken Mrs Wheeldon says she believes that the toddler was given the substance to keep him quiet and to enable his mother to take drugs in peace.
'What I can never forgive is the fact that Kelly didnt come to me, say she was in a bad way, and ask me to look after Fenton full time,' she adds.
'I cant believe Ill never see my Fentons cheeky face again. I just wish Kelly had come to me. Instead she decided it was easier to drug him. Shes no mother  shes a monster.'

        <MainBody>Cameron meets with Juncker to discuss British reform proposals
Tension: Mr Cameron could face an uphill battle in winning sympathy from Mr Juncker after he voted against him for the top commission job
Mr Cameron held talks with the European Commission president at the Prime Minister's country retreat, Chequers (pictured) in Buckinghamshire
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION REFERENDUM?
Why are we having a referendum?
The Prime Minister announced in 2013 that he would ask the public to decide whether the UK should remain a part of the European Union if he led the Conservatives to victory in May's general election.
When will it happen?
Mr Cameron has promised to put the question to the electorate by the end of 2017, but it could happen as early as 2016. That would be 41 years since the last such vote, when 67% said they wanted to remain 'in'.
Why wait at all?
Rather than base the choice on the existing relationship with Brussels, Mr Cameron is seeking to secure a new deal. Negotiations with the other 27 member states are bound to be fraught and complex and are only now beginning in earnest. A year is considered the minimum period he will need to pull together what he hopes will be sufficient reforms to persuade the public not to sever formal ties with the bloc.
What will the question be?
The Conservatives' preferred wording has been: 'Do you think that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?' The watchdog which oversees referendums, the Electoral Commission, raised concerns that some people might think the country was not already a member, and proposed instead: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?'.
Will a referendum happen automatically?
No. An Act of Parliament is required for any such national vote to happen. It is due to be published on Thursday after being announced in the Queen's Speech.Now that Labour has reversed its opposition to a referendum - it should be easily passed by MPs.But it will face a much stiffer test in the House of Lords where the lack of a Tory majority will allow challenges over key aspects including the question, the timing and who can vote.
Mr Cameron's welcome to his guest even included a reminder that Britain had saved Europe from the Nazis.
In a pointed intervention, he told Mr Juncker that they were meeting in the room reputedly used by Winston Churchill to write some of his most famous wartime speeches. 'Think of 'we'll fight them on the beaches',' he told him.
The Prime Minister also could not resist teasing the Eurocrat, who has faced rumours about his fondness for cognac, by offering to show him Churchill's brandy glass.
The Prime Minister will visit Paris and Berlin this week as part of a European charm offensive before the summit.
He will fly to Denmark on Thursday for a working breakfast with his counterpart Helle Thorning-Schmidt, going on to the Netherlands to meet Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte before ending the day with talks over dinner at the Elysee Palace with Mr Hollande.
On Friday, the Prime Minister will travel to Poland for discussions with prime minister Ewa Kopacz in Warsaw before concluding the trip in Berlin, where he will hold talks with Mrs Merkel.
His dinner with Mr Juncker was not expected to produce any conclusive solutions for Britain, a source said, but it would give the Prime Minister a chance to air concerns over continued membership of the EU.
The source added: 'It is an opportunity for the PM to underline why he is doing this and the views of Britain about the EU, the case for renegotiation and not sticking with the status quo.'
Mr Cameron could face an uphill battle in winning sympathy from Mr Juncker after he voted against him for the top commission job.
At the time, he described Mr Juncker's appointment as a 'backroom deal' and a 'serious mistake'. Mr Juncker, who wants an ever-closer political union across Europe, has ruled out any changes to the right of freedom of movement, which could thwart Britain's attempts to control its own borders.
However, he has said he will discuss minor treaty changes.
Labour and the SNP were accused of trying to 'hijack' the EU referendum last night  as they vowed to force Mr Cameron to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote.
The Prime Minister has prevented 1.5million EU migrants from getting a say in the referendum and his decision to use the general election register also means that only those aged 18 or over will get a vote.
Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats will seek to amend the legislation. Their strength is in the Lords, where they have more peers, and it could create a stand-off between the two Houses.

	Jonathan Rhys Meyers issues a public apology after drunken appearance

        <Description>
	The actor, 37, released a statement via his fiancee Mara Lane's Instagram account, insisting he was 'embarrassed' of his appearance earlier this month when he was seen drinking vodka neat.

Explaining his 'disheveled' appearance, he says that he was heading home after a night out with friends.
'I am on the mend and thank well wishers and sorry for my disheveled appearance as I was on my way home from a friends and had not changed,' he continues.
Disheveled: The 37-year-old hit headlines due to his scruffy and bleary-eyed appearance. He was photographed drinking vodka neat and explains that he is 'embarrassed', referring to the relapse as a 'mistake'
'I feel I made a mistake and feel quite embarrassed but this was just a blip in my recovery otherwise I'm living a healthy life.'
His very public 'blip' hit headlines in early May after the actor was spotted staggering through the streets of the capital after buying two bottles of vodka.
He looked scruffy and bleary-eyed as he stopped to take a shot of the spirit he had poured into the bottle cap, spilling some down his top as he walked.
The Irish star's disorientated appearance was a far cry from his usual image as a heartthrob, famed for his roles inMatch Point and Mission: Impossible III.
Jonathan Rhys Meyers starred in 'Dracula' back in 2013
Sorry:The Irish star used his fiancee Mara Lane's Instagram account to say sorry to his fans and colleagues on new film Damascus Cover
Support:He insisted he and his partner wanted to thank his fans for their 'kindness' in the wake of his relapse hitting the headlines
Bond: The star has reportedly been mostly stable since he began dating the actress/producer in early 2014. He reportedly proposed in December
The actor has had a well-publicised battle with alcohol since first shooting to fame in 2002 as the love interest of Parminder Nagra's character in the hit British movie Bend it Like Beckham.
Jonathan is believed to have had six stints in rehab over the past few years, including programmes at the Promises facility in Malibu, California in 2005 and 2007.
On 27 February 2009, the actor checked into rehab a third time, but left less than a month later on 15 March 2009.
In November 2011, the star was ordered by a French court to pay a restitution of 1,000 and was given a judgment of a suspended sentence for public intoxication 24 months earlier.
Acclaim: His shocking appearance was a far cry from his image as a handsome lead, a reputation he has gained through roles in projects such as hit series The Tudors
Jonathan Rhys Meyers starred as King Henry VIII in The Tudors
Shortly after his mother died in November 2007, Jonathan gave an interview to the Mail on Sunday's Live magazine to promote his hit show The Tudors, in which he insisted his drinking had been 'blown out of all proportion'.
'I havent even thought about drinking since my mother passed away. Drinking is not the way forward for me at all,' he said. 'I never even drank till I was 25 anyway. I was in Thailand on my own, filming. I was a little bit lonely and I started drinking.'
It was thought that his fiancee Mara - who is an actress and producer - had helped the troubled star stay clean since they began dating last year.
Jonathan reportedly proposed in December after less than a year of dating.
A source told E! News at the time: 'They are so in love. He is in a great place and Mara and Jonathan really complement one another. He is healthy and happy and starts shooting Damascus Cover [soon].'
Battle: The actor has been in rehab a reported six times over recent years, including two stints at thePromises facility in Malibu, California in 2005 and 2007
Demons: Jonathan has had a highly publicised battle with drink since he shot to fame in 2002's Bend It Like Beckham

	TV host and vlogger Brandi Milloy, from LA, said she was inspired to release her own recipe after it was revealed the fast-food chain uses 14 ingredients to make the potato snack in the US.

Imahara adds dimethylpolysiloxane for safety reasons to prevent cooking oil from foaming, and tertiary butylhydroquinone is applied as a food preservative.
Brandi's recipe manages to side-step nine of the chain's ingredients for fries with the final cut including just five.
She said it was possible as making fries at home is done on a much smaller scale.
Brandi's simple hacks demonstrate how to achieve the same great flavour without the help of chemicals
Brandi claims that her recipe resorts in even crispier and tastier fries than those served in McDonald's
Brandi added: 'Most of those are additives that are needed when manufacturing millions of French Fries that are shipped all over the world every single day so unless you plan on starting a franchise from your kitchen you don't need a lot of them.'
The vlogger demonstrates that the salty flavour of the famous fries can be recreated by swapping the chemical ingredients for ones available at supermarkets.
She suggests using peanut oil instead of McDonald's refined oil as it has a high smoking point and a neutral flavour.
Brandi also reveals simple hacks to replicate the colour and flavour of its French Fries. She says the chain adds sugar to its chips in order to achieve a golden colour.
She continues: 'They add dextrose to the French Fries which is basically a fancy word for sugar.
From potato to carton: McDonald's reveals how it makes fries
Learning curve: Mythbusters host Grant Imahara travelled to the fast food chain's potato processing plant in Idaho to see the production process from start to finish
Your meal is served: A large serving of the finished product contains 510 calories, 6gms of protein, 24gms of fat, 67gms of carbs and 290mgs of sodium in the US
'The added sugar caramelises during the fry process and that's what gives the French Fries that distinct colour.'
But rather than add excess sugar, the chef reveals that a simple store cupboard ingredient of corn syrup can achieve the same effect.
Brandi also reveals that adding beef bouillon to seasoning can achieve the distinctive McDonald's taste without the help of industrial flavour baths.
Brandi ends the video by sampling a fry and concludes that you needn't make a trip to the drive-thru for a satisfactory fry.
'These French Fries taste awesome, way less ingredients than McDonald's and they taste better than the original,' she says.

	Peter and Eileen Crichton, 72 and 65, from Loughborough, have clocked up over 200,000 miles in their 3.5 V8i 1991 Land Rover Discovery, named Rabia.

The Crichtons, now based near Loughborough, Leicestershire, lived in Saudi Arabia in the 1990s when Peter was Vice President of the Olayan Group, one of the largest private manufacturing operations in the Middle East, and bought Rabia soon after her construction in 1991.
'At first the car was used to provide transport while we stayed in the Middle East but it didn't take long for our journeys to become short expeditions,' said Peter.
'By 1997, our travels in Rabia became more serious and in 1997, after the unification of Yemen, we planned and executed a 5,100 mile circumnavigation of the Arabian Peninsula.'
Eileen has a quick stretch of her legs after parking the Land Rover up at Tombstone Mountain in Canada
This is certainly off-roading as the Land Rover is brought to a halt on a hill outside a beautiful Scottish castle
It's not easy driving in hot conditions, so Peter has a bit of a rest on the bonnet in Saudi Arabia
Peter and Eileen have never looked back and named their beloved Land Rover 'Rabia', a name used in the Middle East to describe a person empowered to conduct travellers safely through different tribal territories.
Peter said: 'In 1998, we completed a second circular expedition through northern Arabia, Jordan and Syria, returning home over the Great Nafud.
'Rabia had opened doors for us that we could not have imagined. There just had to be more.'
Their ambitious plans to reach new horizons were supported by Peter's employers, the Olayan Group.
A Satellite phone in the vehicle was used to keep in contact with Peter's office during some extended periods of travel outside the Middle East.
Here's hoping the handbrake is on, during a drive to the western Sahara, and right, the winding roads of south Chile
Ancient art was just one highlight of the couple's drive around Saudi Arabia
Making sure she is wrapped up to deal with chilly weather, Eileen poses for a stunning landscape photo in Norway
Next up for Peter and Eileen was a trip around the world by the longest land route possible from west to east.
In 1999, they shipped Rabia to Pakistan from Dubai and crossed over the Himalayas into China, embarking on a journey around the remotest parts of the region.
Peter said: 'After three months of expedition travel we reached the northwest Pacific coast in Siberia and shipped Rabia to North America.
'We restarted the global circuit in Spring 2000 at the most westerly point we could reach in Alaska's Aleutian Chain, crossing the continent to the very edge of a cliff in Newfoundland three months later.
'It took another two months during the autumn to travel back to our start point in the Middle East, discovering for ourselves that the world was indeed round.
'We were immensely proud. We'd travelled 26,000 miles through amazing places and probably achieved a first in expedition travel.'
These finger-like mountains were visited in Turkey, while right, similar formations were discovered in Mali
The luscious greenery of Ireland provided a serene stop-off for the Loughborough-based couple
Peter and Eileen didn't stop there, embarking on a second global circuit in 2002 through the Southern Hemisphere.
After circling Australia they shipped to South America, traversing the 5,000 mile Inca Trail through the Andes from Chile to Colombia.
They spent 2003 in South America before shipping Rabia to Morocco in the spring of 2004 where they travelled throughout northwest Africa before returning to the UK.
Travels throughout Africa by the couple took much of 2006, 2007, and 2008.
Then, starting in 2010, they drove from a barren headland in northern Scandinavia, the most northerly location on the planet Rabia could get to, before heading over the Equator to reach the most southerly point.
The hilly PakistanKaraktom Highway proved no challenge to the trusty Land Rover, while right, extreme measures had to be taken to cross into Congo
The Land Rover meets an old friend here as the couple check out a disused vehicle in Argentina
The snow-topped mountains of Argentina provide a glorious backdrop for another addition to the photo album
Peter said: 'This was one of our proudest moments. We were as close to Cape Horn as it was possible to travel, reaching probably the maximum possible southerly destination for a single vehicle.
'In terms of our personal highlights of our travels, it's really difficult to say.
'We'd have to mention the Karakoram Highway through northern Pakistan, travelling through the Himalayas to China and also the wild mountainous landscape of the Andes in South America.
'Rabia has never failed us but her personal moment of outstanding success has to be the 450 mile crossing of the Amazon Basin from Manaus in Brazil south to reach Bolivia.
It's time to park up and take in the surroundings for the couple here in the Canadian Rockies
The Land Rover interrupts the animals grazing in Chile, as the landscape shows off a beautiful array of colours
Sometimes it was just necessary to put the handbrake on, and take a deep breath to take in the surroundings
'Our journeys have brought us in contact with amazing people as well as amazing landscapes and it has permanently enriched our lives in a way that we could not have anticipated.
'We admired some really important aspects of social cohesion and enduring family values which many remote communities continue to enjoy.
'Without exception, there had been unfailing friendliness from the inhabitants of these more distant places on our route.'
And with the trip on the Continental Divide planned before the year is out, the trusty Land Rover is set to be dusted down wheeled out of the garage once more.
The couple's next expedition is planned for December this year, when they aim to travel from Panama to Canada

	William Paterson who stalked former Miss Scotland contestant faces jail

	William Paterson, pictured, was told he was 'deluded, controlling, jealous and possessive' by Stirling Sheriff's Court after he was convicted of stalking his former girlfriend Jay Goodwillie.

He also contacted one of her former male friends on Facebook, asked him whether he'd had sex with her, and quizzed him about her.
Then, just before she was due to do on duty as special constable, he messaged her: 'Go out and get stabbed tonight, you selfish cow.'
Miss Goodwillie told the court that she was unable to carry on with her shift after receiving the shocking message.
After a three-day summary trial - the last day of which lasted over eight hours - Paterson was found guilty of engaging in stalking Miss Goodwillie between February 16 and March 2 last year.
Paterson, of Causewayhead, Stirling, who pleaded not guilty, said in evidence that he could not have been 'stalking' Miss Goodwillie - because, he insisted, they were still in a relationship all the time
Jay Goodwillie, centre, was described as a credible and reliable witness in Stirling Sheriff's Court
Paterson will reappear at Stirling Sheriff's Court, pictured, on June 17 for sentencing
Sheriff Wyllie Robertson said that Miss Goodwillie had been a credible and reliable witness.
He said: 'I accept her evidence that over the period of their relationship the accused had repeatedly accused her of
cheating,
and was possessive and jealous of her interaction with other men, however innocent, and notwithstanding the assurances she repeatedly gave him.
'His subsequent behaviour is eloquent of that control,
jealously
and possessiveness.
'I am satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that sending offensive texts, including threats of retribution and payback, threatening to contact the Press and others, and that he had "contacts", were all calculated to frighten Miss Goodwillie, which they did.
'By following up a message that he had received that Mr Hill was now a friend of Miss Goodwillie, searching him out, phoning him, pretending to be a police officer, eliciting personal information, warning him off Miss Goodwillie, threatening him, contacting another friend of hers and disclosing personal information and seeking intimate details of his relationship with her and threatening him in the event that he did not respond - the terms of which were utterly indefensible and inexcusable by the standards of any right minded person - he was bound to have caused Miss Goodwillie upset and distress.'
He added: 'These actions could not in any circumstances be regarded as reasonable, and in suggesting that they were, he [Paterson] is deluded.'
Sheriff Robertson deferred sentence on Paterson for reports, until June 17, and released him on bail.
He also deferred consideration of a Crown request for a non-harassment order, requiring him to stay away from her for five years.
During the trial, Miss Goodwillie, of Stirling, who is also a trainee solicitor, wept as she recalled that she got the 'go out and get stabbed tonight' message before she was due to go on duty on Feb
28
2014 - and could not go because she was in 'such a state' as a result.
She said Paterson sent her threatening messages from a Facebook site. One message he sent her came with a profile picture that showed him posing with members of former boyband Westlife.
On Valentine's Day 2014 he messaged her: 'We were a couple for over two years. I really don't deserve this. Why are you treating me like s****? I want a reply or be ready for a backlash.'
He also messaged Miss Goodwillie, 'Karma will return one day' and 'F*** off and die.'
The court was told Paterson had been a professional auctioneer since 1988 specialising in livestock and agricultural sales, with more than 20 years of doing charity work.

Those considered the most beautiful are then sent to Islamic State's adopted capital where they are sold naked, the UN envoy now claims.
They are first offered to the leaders of the depraved organisation, followed by the Emirs, and finally the soldiers.
Each buyer usually takes three or four girls and keeps them for a few months before they grow tired of them and sell them again, she told Middle East Eye .
IS 'were looking for women and they took them for themselves'
Depravity: The captured girls are first offered to ISIS leaders, then its Emirs, followed by the fighters, United Nation's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in ConflictZainab Bangura (pictured) claims
She added: 'We heard of one girl who was traded 22 times and of a Takfiri leader who had written his name on the girl's hand to show that she was his 'property'.
'Tens of thousands of the ISIS members expect that they will [get] women to [marry] following their recruitment.'
She said the extremists banned the girls from using headscarves after some girls used them to hang themselves.
The city of Raqqa  where the girls are supposedly being taken and violated  was adopted by Islamic State as its capital city.
ISIS has released several gruesome images and videos from the city which show armed militants parading the streets, public executions and the extremists' all-female brigade which enforces its strict interpretation of Sharia Law.
But not all kidnapped girls are taken to the heart of Islamic State's brutal regime. In early April,more than 200 Yazidi women, children and elderly were released near Kirkuk after being taken hostage last June.
Heart of darkness: UN's envoy claims ISIS is taking girls to its adopted capital in Raqqa (pictured), Syria, where the militants have carried out many beheadings (pictured)
Brutal: Raqqa is patrolled by Islamic State's fearsome all-female Al-Khanssaa Brigade (pictured) who violently impose the group's twisted interpretation of Sharia Law
Aid workers reported that among them was a pregnant nine-year-old girl who suffered horrific sexual abuse at the hands of ISIS militants in northern Iraq. She claimed to have been 'sexually abused by no fewer than ten men'.
Hundreds of women and girls were also abducted by ISIS last year after the militants seized the Iraqi city of Sinjar which is mainly populated by Yazidi people.
And another Yazidi girl who was snatched from her family near Mosul described how ISIS stormed her town and took girls as young as 10 to become sex slaves.
Nineteen-year-old Hanan told CNN she was regularly beaten and taken to a warehouse where hundreds of women were lined up and hand picked by the extremists.
There she met a fellow Yazidi girl who said she was held hostage, handcuffed and raped by ISIS fighters.
Women's Rights Director at HRW has claimed 'ISIS forcescommitted organized rape, sexual assault, and other horrific crimes against Yazidi women and girls.'
Liesl Gerntholtz added: 'Those fortunate enough to have escaped need to be treated for the unimaginable trauma they endured.'

	At the start of 2014, 4,247 foreign criminals released from jail were living in Britain, up from just 3,800 in 2011. But by the first three months of this year the number had hit 5,053, figures showed today.

Home Secretary Theresa May and Prime Minister David Cameron talk to Immigration Enforcement officers after the officers raided residential properties looking for illegal immigrants in Southall, West London, last week
Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 318,000 in 2014, according to the Office for National Statistics
A FRESH CRACKDOWN ON PEOPLE LIVINGAND WORKING ILLEGALLY
David Cameron will use a speech today to set out a new crackdown on people in Britain illegally. It includes:
A new offence of working illegally will give police powers to seize the wages of people with no right to take a job in the UK
Councils will be told to crackdown on unscrupulous landlords and have power to evict illegal workers and migrants more quickly;
Banks will have to check all accounts against a database of known illegal immigrants
All appeals against deportation in non-asylum cases will only be allowed after they have left the UK, to 'stop people frustrating the system'
Foreign criminals waiting to be deported will be tagged using sat-nav technology to stop them absconding
It will become an offence for businesses and agencies to recruit abroad without also advertising in the UK
A new labour market enforcement agency will crack down on the worst cases of labour market exploitation
The experts said around one in six foreign criminals released from jail had disappeared  meaning around 840 criminals have vanished.
Philip Hollobone, the Conservative MP for Kettering, said the public would be 'appalled' at the figures.
The respected backbencher called for foreign criminals to be deported at the end of their sentences rather than being 'allowed to live at large in our community'.
He said: 'The correct response on foreign criminals is that they should serve their sentence in full in their country of origin.
'Even if they serve their time in British jails, once released they should be banished from our kingdom and never allowed to return.
'I don't see why it would be difficult to establish such a law  it would send a very clear signal to the international criminal community that they are not welcome in this country.'
Mr Hollobone added that he hoped the Government's plan to abolish Labour's Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights would help increase the number of foreign nationals who can be removed.
'I don't know what the Home Office is playing at here because they've had plenty of time to increase removals,' said the MP.
'If the Human Rights Act is abolished the Home Office will have no excuse, and will have to make this a priority issue.'
In another new development revealed in the figures, the number of foreigners being removed by the Home Office has collapsed still further.
In 2014, 12,460 people were removed from the UK  a 17 per cent fall on 2011 when more than 15,000 were sent back including 4,000 failed asylum seekers.
It also represented a fall of more than 40 per cent on levels a decade ago, when the figure stood at more than 21,000.

A bunch of meat bones simmering in a pot doesn't sound like a fashionable drink.
But bone broth was all the rage at this year's New York Fashion Week.
Devotees claim the meaty drink can ward off illnesses, ease joint and stomach pains, boost the immune system, brighten the skin and make the hair shiny.
Not only that, advocates swear it gives them energy and helps them sleep better. 
And now, the trend has spread from Manhattan to cities across the globe.
Writing for Healthista , Sarah Maber, founder of the Brighton Bone Broth Co, explains why she believes we will soon all be ditching our cappucinos for cups of meat soup...
Sarah Maber believes more people will be ditching coffee in favour of a nutritious cup of bone broth (raw ingredients pictured) - which she claims is even more energising than caffeine
The latest bone broth trend emerged after celebrity food writers the Hemsley sisters, Melissa and Jasmine, hailed it as a forgotten superfood
Hemsley and Hemsley's 'Spiralizer' product (related)
Its a question Im often asked: Why did I start a broth company?
It's not, after all, the obvious business choice for a journalist  especially one who was vegetarian for nigh on two decades.
The answer? I care about my health, I care about what I eat (years of interviewing experts for health stories has taught me that the food we eat can heal or harm).
I believe that more and more of us will be swapping our flat whites for restorative takeaway broths in the next few months
Sarah Maber, broth devotee
And I believe that more and more of us will be swapping our flat whites for restorative takeaway broths in the next few months.
Six months ago, however, I confess I had no idea how wonderful a nutritious cup of bone broth could be.
I first heard about broth via celebrity food writers the Hemsley sisters, who hailed it as a forgotten superfood.
But the trend for takeaway bone broth was firmly set during New York fashion week earlier this year.
Instead of their usual takeout Starbucks, the fash pack were instead snapped sipping health-boosting cups of broth at the shows.
Queues at Brodo, the citys first broth bar, stretched round the block and suddenly, the US press was dedicating cookery columns, features pages, news stories and airtime to the new miracle drink.

Well, we all know by now that what starts Stateside soon follows here, and as health journalist and food writer, I was soon commissioned to write a feature on the emerging bone broth trend.
A quick Google search revealed that it wasnt just Manhattans food-savvy fashion editors who had embraced the trend.
Bone broth is a staple for fans of the Paleo diet, and a growing number of nutritionists are also raving about broths restorative properties.
WHAT ARE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF BONE BROTH?
Aficionados claim protein broth is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen, and that drinking it will do everything from warding off illnesses to curing joint pain, and giving you healthy skin, nails and hair.
And at just 86 calories per cup, it's a very slimming lunch option.
Bone broth is rich in amino acids - the building blocks of protein - calcium and collagen
But Sian Porter, spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, isn't convinced. 'Bone broth does contain nutrients, minerals and vitamins, but in pretty low quantities. You'd get far more goodness from just eating meat.'
However, she says, making your own stock is 'certainly better than buying it in a cube, as you can control what goes in it'. Bone broths have traditionally been prescribed for colds, flu and digestive health, says Laura Tilt, a registered dietitian.
'The main protein in bone broth is gelatine. Gelatine supplements have been shown to improve pain and stiffness in osteoarthritis sufferers, but whether you get the same benefits from broth is unclear.'
Stockpots full of bones, vegetables and water have simmered quietly away in kitchens the world over for centuries, gently extracting vital vitamins and minerals into a delicious, nutrient-dense, protein-rich broth.
In India and China, broth is still ladled out as an immunity booster, a secret weapon against sickness.
The long cooking time allows valuable minerals deep within the bones to be extracted.
Drink a cup of broth and youll also be getting a hit of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium, minerals that are known to help heal your digestive system and prevent insomnia, fatigue and anxiety.
Youll also be packing in the collagen, which strengthens hair, skin and nails and which may even help with inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis and IBS.
The U.S. broth revival also dovetails neatly into food trends  the Paleo diet, nose to tail eating and the clean eating movement, to name just a few.
No wonder it had been welcomed so heartily by Manhattans hip, health-conscious foodies.
While Im no stranger to a culinary challenge  I was tasked with conjuring up delicious, nutritious, low calorie meal plans for the best-selling Fast Diet  the process of making a pot of bones and water taste good took a few weeks.
Trial and error eventually threw up some basic rules.
I was soon drinking two or three cups of broth a day, and the benefits were noticeable.
My skin was visibly better, and I felt healthier and less sluggish.
Bone broth comes in at around 80 calories for an 8oz cup and is perfect for keeping you going between meals, so my sugar/snack consumption nose-dived.
Soon the whole family was happily tucking in.
My four-year-old started requesting bone broth as his bedtime drink - and my dad, who has suffered from serious digestive issues for years, found a mug of broth soothing and comforting.
We launched the Brighton Bone Broth Company four weeks ago, selling chicken and beef broth made from locally sourced, free range bones, to cafes in Brighton and Hove.
We are lucky to live in a foodie city that embraces new trends, and our broth regularly sells out.
But as a health writer and formerly wiped out, haggard mother-of-two, I also want to shout about it as loudly and as often as possible.
Ditch the sugar-loaded juices and jitter-inducing cappuccinos, and choose health-boosting, healing bone broth instead.
Advocates say bone broth can ease stomach and joint pains, as well as brighten skin and make hair shiny
6 RULES FOR COOKING BONE BROTH
1. Treat chicken and beef bones differently
Chicken and beef bones should be treated differently.
Beef bones taste best when roasted first, then need to be cooked for a minimum of 12 hours with lots of garlic, tomato puree, herbs, vegetables and, in the final stages, lime juice, ginger and a kick of chilli.
Chicken carcasses are easier  simply simmer for 8-12 hours with a big handful of veg and herbs, and add lemon and extra helping of parsley towards the end.
2. Cider vinegar helps
Drink a cup of broth and youll be getting a hit of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium
Dont forget to add a good splash of cider vinegar to your pot at the beginning of cooking  this helps extract the minerals.
3. Skim  and skim some more
Set aside the first hour or two of cooking to skim, skim and skim some more.
This gets rid of the impurities that float to the top of the pan. 
Try and keep the water as clean and clear as possible and wipe the edges of your pot when they are dirty.
Skimming fat from the surface needs to be done regularly throughout the cooking process.
4. Uses loads of bones
For a rich, robust broth, you need a whole lotta bones. I fill the pot, and then cover with water.
5. If it turns to jelly, youve won
You know youve made a good broth when it turns into jelly in the fridge.
Thats the gelatin from deep inside the bones, which is full of amino acids and a sign of a really good, nutrient-rich broth.

	Tourism bosses slam 'Gove effect' calling for term-time holiday reclassification

	The new rules, introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove in 2013, mean families can be fined up to £60 a day for taking their children out of school.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
But under Gove's new rules, a mid-term break can only be approved under 'exceptional circumstances'.
Robin Barker, chairman of the Tourism Society Westcountry, told the Western Morning News that the rules were costing the industry 87 million a year.
The tourist board is due to hold a crisis meeting next month but Mr Barker believes that staggering school holidays may be one solution.
He added: 'The Westcountry is more reliant on the family market, including those with pre school or early years children, than other areas and there are some places that, when they are hit by things like this find it a battle to keep going.'
Since the rules were introduced, the number of parents being fined for taking their children on holiday during term-time has soared by nearly 70 per cent.
At school rather than on holiday: Schools minister Nick Gibb said that as a result of the new rules introduced in September, 130,000 fewer pupils were regularly missing lessons
Some 63,837 penalties were issued to mothers and fathers in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months.
Many of the fines by local authorities were for truancy or repeated poor attendance, but the majority were for letting children skip lessons because of holiday, the BBC said.
But it hasn't stopped as many as one in three parents risking fines and prosecution because they will not or cannot afford to pay the inflated holiday prices that kick in the day that the schools break-up.
At the same time, some one in five of these parents are telling lies and trying to hide what they are doing by putting their childs absence down to an invented illness.
GOVE'S RULES ON TERM-TIME BREAKS
The new rules were introduced on September 1, 2013, with the aim of preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education.
Headteachers were previously allowed to grant up to ten days off to let children go on holiday with their families during term time when prices areconsiderablycheaper.
But the changes mean schools can only grant time off under 'exceptional circumstances.'
Anyone breaching the rules face of a fine of up to 60 a day per child.
This rises to 120 if not paid within 21 days, andparents who refuse can be prosecuted and could face a 2,500 fine and three months in prison.
The vast majority of people breaking the rules -72 per cent  say the sole reason is because of the high cost of holidays during the official school summer break.
The figures come from research by the Nationwide building society, which also found the current system means a family can expect to pay an extra 1,347 for a foreign break in Spain.
The policy has caused enormous anger among parents, while a London banker has recently lodged a legal test case to challenge the law.
James Haymore was summonsed to court after he refused to pay a 120 fine for taking his children to America for six days at the start of the spring term for a memorial service for their great-grandfather.
Mr Haymore, who works for JP Morgan, will argue that the decision to prosecute him for taking his three children out of school is a breach of the Human Rights Act.
A spokesman for the Nationwide said: Given the fact that the premium for a typical holiday in Spain for a family of four could be as much as 1,347 more during school holidays compared with term-time, its no wonder that parents are still tempted to face the ire of their childrens head teacher, plus the threat of a fine, in order to save some significant cash.
It looked at the cost of a holiday for a family of four with two children aged seven and nine for the first week in July, which is in term time, versus the first week in August.
The cost of the same one week holiday in Spain rose from 1,508 to 2,855, which is an increase of 1,347. The price of a holiday at CenterParc in Wiltshire rose by 860 to 2,448, while the figure for Disneyland Paris went up by 369 to 2,827.
In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last Autumn for keeping her daughter off school for seven days.
Kerry Capper, 25, was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days
Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer.
In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy.
The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups.
Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.
She was ordered to pay a 120 penalty fine, but was cleared of a criminal act.
In another case taken up by the campaign group, a five-year-old was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad.
Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September.
Craig Stephenson, a police officer, can only take leave only at authorised times. Because of his work commitments he was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went.
This man was fined 630 for taking his kids out of school...
'Now we are left in limbo wondering whether we will be fined,' said Pauline Stephenson. 'It is not something we would normally do but we took books for her and the trip was educational. We went into Paris and Lauren learnt French words.
'I feel annoyed because we are good parents and we take school very seriously. This is the only family holiday we have ever had abroad.'
In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a 120 fine for taking their three children to the US to attend a family memorial service.
He refused to pay a 120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a 2,500 fine and a jail term.
But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the US.
Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays.
Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short 120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work.
TOP 10 LOCAL AUTHORITIES ISSUING THE MOST FINES IN 2013-2014
1. Lancashire, 3,106 (1,125 in 2012-13); up 176 per cent.
2. Kent,2,973 (2,868 in 2012-13;) up three per cent.
3 Leicester,2,728 (2,726 in 2012-13); no change.
4. West Sussex,2,403 (973 in 2012-13); up 146 per cent.
5. Luton,2,249 (1,395 in 2012-13); up 61 per cent.
6. Oldham, 2,022 (1,190 in 2012-13); up 69 per cent.
7. Manchester, 1,911 (1,234 in 2012-13); up 54 per cent.
8. East Sussex, 1,756 (1,237 in 2012-13); up 41 per cent.
9.East Riding of Yorkshire, 1,594 (1,066 in 2012-13); up 49 per cent.
10. Doncaster, 1,464 (630 in 2012-13); up 132 per cent.
He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine.
But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission.
A spokesman for the Department for Education said 130,000 fewer pupils were regularly missing school and were getting a better education as a result of the ruling.
He said: 'The myth that pulling a child out of education for holidays is harmless to their education has been disproved by evidence. Allowing pupils to regularly miss school can be hugely detrimental to a child's life chances.
'This Government has given all schools the freedom to set their own term dates from September 2015 but we have made it clear that schools should consider the impact on local businesses when doing so. We have consulted with representatives from the tourism industry.'
However, after the string of controversial cases,the government looks set to relax the holiday ban for special occasions.
The new guidelines drawn up by head teachers' leaders make clear when families can take children away from classes.
The rules have been backed by new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and will allow children to attend family weddings or funerals, recover after a personal or family crisis, attend a religious event or visiting a relative who is seriously ill.
But parents will still be prevented from taking advantage of cheap holiday breaks in term time.

	Professor Neena Modi, the UK’s most senior children’s doctor, claims Britain's obesity strategy ‘is failing’ because babies begin to become fat in their mother’s womb.
      </Description>

One in five 11-year-olds are obese and the proportion of obese children has doubled in primary school.
Simon Stevens, the head of NHS England said that the health service would need billions of pounds more in funding to tackle the problem of ballooning obesity in children.
But Professor Modi criticised Mr Stevens for having fallen into the pitfall of mistaking association with causation, The Times reported.
Hes starting off with a very useful observation: children become obese in these critical early years, she said.
Professor Modi attacked government anti-obesity campaigns, saying that they have all been failures and suggested that early intervention programmes were crucial to prevent the obesity epidemic growing
But I would say where did the trajectory actually start? Now I know from my own research that it actually starts in utero and in infancy.
Professor Modi told The Times: An obese mother with gestational diabetes is going to have a baby which is more adipose, has more fatty tissue.
Babies born to women who are overweight or obese when they become pregnant have a higher risk of becoming overweight themselves
Judy More, paediatric dietitian
That baby has been set on a trajectory which is leading towards obesity in childhood and adulthood. What we dont know yet is how we can intervene.
Commenting on the issue, Judy More, paediatric dietitian and member of the Infant &amp; Toddler Forum (ITF), said: 'We are in agreement with Professor Modi, in that a health focus needs to be on women who are planning to become pregnant or are already pregnant.
'There is evidence now that shows babies born to women who are overweight or obese when they become pregnant have a higher risk of becoming overweight themselves.
'Babies born to mothers who gain excess weight during pregnancy have the same risk.
'To stop the cycle of obesity we need to act before the conception of the next generation and help women to adopt healthy lifestyles before conception and during pregnancy.'
She added: 'Our report Early Nutrition for Later Health: Time to Act Earlier, highlights the need to take a life course approach to health and wellbeing starting before pregnancy, and continuing throughout the very early years to encourage healthy family lifestyles.
Families need consistent, simple, advice to get back on the right track if we are going to halt the obesity epidemic and we need to act now.'
FAT PEOPLE ARE TEMPTED BY ADVERTS FOR JUNK FOOD, STUDY REVEALS
By Lizzie Parry
Obese teenagers are more susceptible to the lure of fast food adverts, a new study has revealed.
Brain scans show the sight of a burger or pizza dripping in melted cheese, a doughnut sprinkled in sugar, stimulates the brains of overweight teens.
Researchers suggest their findings prove that TV commercials mentally stimulate unhealthy eating habits.
The parts of the brain disproportionately affected include the regions that control pleasure, taste and the mouth.
It suggests exposure to adverts at a young age might make it difficult to lose weight later in life.
The scientists, from Dartmouth College, in New Hampshire, said dieting efforts should not only target the initial desire to eat tempting food, but also the subsequent thinking about actually tasting and eating it.

	Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson, 66, underwent a procedure at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital yesterday. He has stabilised in the wake of a suspected heart attack, a party colleague has said.

Five years ago, when Mr Robinson temporarily stood down from office to deal with a political scandal that had engulfed his wife Iris, Mrs Foster took over as First Minister on a temporary basis.
She said the prospect of any similar arrangement while he recovered from his health issues had yet to be discussed.
'None of those issues have been discussed as yet,' she told BBC Radio Ulster.
'It was a great shock to us yesterday when Peter did have to go into hospital and I am sure we will have discussions today about all of those things in relation to the party.'
Mr Robinson suffered a suspected heart attack yesterday. He is pictured here, along with Martin McGuinness, greeting the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at St Patricks Church in Belfast last week
Mr Robinson's deputy Nigel Dodds added: 'We have not taken any decision yet in relation to putting in an acting first minister. We will wait and see what the situation is. We will keep that under review.'
He said the DUP had a strong team to progress any negotiations about the future of the badly-split devolved power-sharing government.
'We have a very, very strong team, both at Westminster and in the Assembly and Executive ministers, and we will take things forward in terms of any discussions and negotiations with that team. Hopefully, Peter will be able to return very, very soon,' Mr Dodds added.
Mr Robinson initially went to seek treatment early yesterday morning at the Ulster Hospital, which is close to his home in the Castlereagh hills
'We will continue to resolutely put forward our view. People know where we stand, that is why we have not abandoned todays proceedings in the Assembly.
'We will carry on and we will have business as usual.'
On prospective changes to the benefits system, Mr Dodds said:'We have made it very, very clear that we have run out of road as far as the welfare reform issue is concerned.
'There have been full negotiations; it is not a question of this business of "lets all get together and talk to the Government and negotiate", there have been full negotiations before Christmas, it resulted in an agreement, we want to see that agreement implemented.
'If it cannot be implemented and if people will not face up to economic and political reality in Sinn Fein and elements of the SDLP then it is over to the British Government, it is over to them to say what they are going to do and in our view they have to step in and take welfare reform powers.
'Remember Scotland, with its strong devolution settlement in the Scottish Parliament - welfare is not a devolved matter so it is clear that there is precedent in this area and the Government needs to act, in our view, to resolve the crisis.'
Mr Robinson is now being treated at a specialist cardiac unit at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast
Yesterday Prime Minister David Cameron was among the first politicians to wish Mr Robinson well.
He said on Twitter: 'My best wishes to Northern Ireland's First Minister, Peter Robinson, who is in hospital. I hope he has a speedy recovery.'
Sinn Fein's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness wrote that he was worried.
He said: 'Concerned to hear First Minister Peter Robinson has been admitted to hospital. My thoughts &amp; prayers are with him, Iris &amp; family.'
DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds also used Twitter to show his support. He said: 'Best wishes to DUP leader Peter Robinson for a quick and full recovery. All our thoughts are with Peter and family. God bless.'
PETER ROBINSON: NORTHERN IRELAND'S HARDLINE LEADER WHO HAS BEEN ROCKED BY A SERIES OF PERSONAL AND POLITICAL SCANDALS
Hardline DUP leader Peter Robinson has been rocked by a series of political scandals
With a reputation as an unforgiving negotiator who has ice running through his veins, Peter Robinson is viewed as the invincible leader of the DUP.
The former estate agent, who won his Westminster seat at the age of 30, has been the brains behind the hard-line grouping since its inception more than four decades ago.
But, a series of personal and party scandals have taken their toll over the past five years while intense political rows over welfare reform row and same sex marriage have, more recently, heaped further pressure on the 66-year-old father-of-three.
Born in Belfast just after the Second World War, he was inspired by the firebrand oratory of the late Rev Ian Paisley against any compromise with Republicans.
In 1985 he was at the forefront of the unionist campaign against the Anglo Irish Agreement - an accord between the British and Irish governments which gave Dublin a role in affairs in Northern Ireland.
In his latter career he has been a trenchant opponent of all forms of paramilitarism, but during the Troubles he was arrested in the village of Clontibret, in the Irish Republic, after taking part in a so-called 'invasion' along with 500 loyalists as part of the protest. He later pleaded guilty to unlawful assembly.
Mr Robinson and his party colleagues opposed the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, citing its release of paramilitary prisoners as abhorrent.
Atlhough he took office as minister for regional development in the newly created power sharing executive, he refused to take part in cabinet meetings.
The eventual collapse of that assembly benefited the DUP at the polls and they soon displaced the Ulster Unionists as the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland and, in 2006 negotiated the St Andrews Agreement which paved the way for the latest assembly.
Peter and Iris Robinson became Northern Ireland's 'First Couple' when he realised his long term ambition and became Stormont First Minister and DUP leader after the retirement of Ian Paisley in 2008.
However, Mrs Robinson, a born-again Christian, sparked outrage and a police investigation when she described homosexuality as an abomination and claimed gay people could be 'cured'.
In 2010 he temporarily stepped aside as First Minister when details of his wife's affair with the teenager Kirk McCambley were revealed.
His 35-year political career came close to ruin after it emerged Mrs Robinson had asked two property developers to lend her 50,000 to fund a new business for her youthful lover.
A subsequent investigation by the Assembly's Standards committee exonerated Mr Robinson but found that his wife, a former Stranford MLA had breached the code of practise. Mrs Robinson has since resigned from politics.

	Jacob Duffy, seven months old, from Leeds, was born with four extra digits. He also has a hole in his heart, a dairy allergy and a range of eye problems, but doctors do not know what is causing the defects.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share

'My pregnancy was completely normal then we counted the digits and that was the first time we noticed something was wrong.
'We joked around a bit at first and said that at least he will be good on the piano - but obviously we quickly realised that things were a bit more serious.'
His extra toe could affect Jacob as he learns to walk, she added.
HOW CAN BABIES BE BORN WITH EXTRA DIGITS?
Having an extra finger or toe is called polydactyly.
The extradigit may range from a small, raised bump to a complete, working finger or toe. Most of the time, it's smaller than the other digits and not well formed.
Sometimes the extra digit is only skin (a nubbin), and it connects to the hand or foot with only a narrow stalk of tissue.
If the digit is better formed, it may have all the normal tissues - such as bone, muscles, blood vessels and nerves. In this case, it connects to the hand or foot deep inside.
There are three types of polydactyly based on where the digit is:
The extra digit is outside the thumb or big toe (pre-axial polydactyly). When the digit is outside the thumb, it's also called radial polydactyly. When it's outside the big toe, it's also called tibial polydactyly.
The extra digit is outside the little finger or little toe (post-axial polydactyly). When the digit is outside the little finger, it's also called ulnar polydactyly. When it's outside the little toe, it's also called fibular polydactyly.
The extra digit is between other fingers or toes (central polydactyly).
Polydactyly in children is fairly common. It happens in about 1 in 1,000 babies.
Source: Seattle's Children's Hospital 
'Doctors don't want to remove his extra digits until he is 12 months old because they don't want to put him under anaesthetic - even though one toe is really loose and could affect his walking.
'I quite like the extra fingers and I don't really want the surgeons to chop them off but kids are quite cruel and I could hardly send him to school with them.'
When Jacob was born, after discovering his additional fingers and toes, it became clear he also had a number of other birth defects.
These include a hole in his heart and serious problems with his sight.
He also has an allergy to dairy products, and difficulty swallowing, so he requires a thicker feed.
Doctors say he has a medical condition which is the underlying cause of all the health problems  but as yet, this remains undiagnosed.
They hope the hole in his heart will close itself by the time he is one, without the need for surgery.
It is common to have such a hole, and most people with the condition never know they have it.
However, Jacob's eye problems are more serious.
He suffers from the eye conditions coloboma, nystagmus and microphthalmia as well as cataracts, leaving him severely sight-impaired.
Colomba, which affects just 1 in 10,000 babies, is a congenital defect where parts of the structures of the eye do not form properly.
Jacob is quite severely affected; there are gaps in each structure of his eye.
Microphthalmia has left him with one eyeball smaller than the other, while he also has nystagmus, which causes his eyes to twitch, reducing his ability to see.
At the moment, doctors say it is difficult to assess how much his sight is impaired, as he is so young and cannot talk.
They believe he has serious sight problems, but will keep assessing him as he grows.
Ms Hendry says that although Jacob has already spent most of his short life in doctor's surgeries, it does not faze him.
Jacob was also born with a hole in his heart, which is likely to heal, and a range of problems with his eyes. Doctors have no idea what the underlying cause of all his defects are - and are still carrying out tests
His mother Rachael Hendry, 24, is fundraising for sensory equipment to help him develop despite the problems with his sight
Ms Hendry says although Jacob has already spent most of his life in doctor's surgeries, it doesn't faze him. He is pictured here with his older sister
She said: 'He's doing really well now and the focus is on how he develops like any other baby.
'Doctors are keeping a keen eye on him and we're waiting on test results to see exactly what condition he has.
'He has so many defects that it can't just be coincidence.
'He's spent a lot of time at the doctor's - and at first he used to cry a lot - but he's got used to it now - you just get on with it, don't you?'
Ms Hendry and Mr Duffy, 28, now want to raise money for a sensory room, which is full of lights and wires, to help Jacob develop and play, despite his sight problems.
The pair have already raised 1,000 in six weeks towards the equipment, with proceeds also going towards the Hawthorn Family Support Centre in Leeds, where Jacob visits every week.
Friends and family have rallied together to raise money, taking part in the Tough Mudder challenge and hosting raffles, races, assault courses and other fundraising events.
Donations to pay for Jacob's sensory room can be made at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/9yxE8/ab/d4lY2b and www.facebook.com/JacobsColoboma

'Some people have said I shouldn't have been riding a bike that wasn't road legal but there was no way I could have known it was going to happen - there was no frayed cable visible.
'I could feel the bike beginning to skid as I tried my best to slow it down and in the first millisecond noticed some pedestrians I was worried I might hit if they crossed the road.
Shocking moment cyclist runs red light and crashes into bus
Eyewitness: Cyclist Charlie Baker was described as 'very lucky' by the bus driver, who wrote on Facebook: In the cyclists defence his brake cable snapped and he couldnt stop
Caught on camera: The shocking footage was filmed by a motorcyclist who was riding along Portland Street when he managed to capture the accident at the junction of Oxford Street on the afternoon of May 18
'I was also worried about sliding under the bus if I skidded off at an angle so I positioned myself to hit the side of it. By that time you've resigned yourself that the crash is going to happen, that it's going to hurt, and then everything slows down.
'I remember I saw the back wheels as I hit the bus and just rolled out the way so my legs weren't run over.'
Mr Baker said he had been surprised by some of the 'unpleasant' comments made by people who had watched the footage and explained why it appears that he is still pedalling as he continues past the lights.

Builder Charlie Baker, who was onto his way to a meeting at the time of the incident, said he tried to make the lights before they changed but when he realised he couldn't he pulled the front brake and the cable snapped
The moment of impact: Mr Baker said he was worried about skidding off his bike and sliding under the bus so he positioned himself to hit the side of it before rolling away from the rear wheels
'It's a fixie bike so when the front brake failed the only way I could slow down was to push back hard on the pedals - it's almost like trying to pedal backwards but when you're travelling at that speed you can't do that. That's why it looks like I'm still pedalling.'
Responding to the video on YouTube, he wrote: 'It was me. Thought Id just get the lights, hence the speed. Realised it wasnt happening, squeezed the front brake. Cable snapped. Not enough time to lose speed on back wheel in the wet. Not fun.'

Cyclist Charlie Baker
Mr Baker added: 'Its a fixed back wheel, front brake for urgent braking, pushing back on the pedals gives you controlled but sadly slower braking with the back wheel, so what you see is me pushing back as hard as i can but its a c*** bit of road surface and it was wet.'
The bus driver also came to the cyclist's defence.
Gary Wilkinson wrote on the Manchester Evening News Facebook page : 'I was the driver of the bus and just to let everyone know I parked just round the corner and ran back.
'The cyclist was very lucky and only suffered a cut to one of his knuckles. Also in the cyclists defence his brake cable snapped and he couldnt stop.
The motorcyclist, known as Captf, published the video above with the caption: 'Very short one. On the way home tonight, witnessed a red light jumping cyclist meet the side of a bus
The motorcyclist added: 'I have zero sympathies for the guy. But, he was OK in the end. If he had been 1 second sooner, hed be a smear along the road'
Explanation: The cyclist replied to a video of the crash posted to YouTube by writing in the comments section. He said he was riding at speed because he thought he could get through the lights before they changed
Coming to his defence: The bus driver, Gary Wilkinson, responded to the crash video on Facebook. He defended the cyclist, who collided with his bus while he was driving through Manchester city centre
'Scariest thing that ever happened to me.'

	James Fraser was devastated when he found the offensive message on his 'pride and joy' in the latest in a long line of racial attacks at the family's home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

'She was so upset about it and this has just hit her so hard. People can be very cruel.'
James and Brenda who have been married for 10 years, were awoken at 2.45am on Saturday morning by a knock at the door from the police.
A neighbour had spotted a man using a metal object to scratch the words into the husband and wife's cars and reported it.
To his horror, James found the words 'black c**t' on the driver's door panel in eight inch letters and the words 'haha c**t' on the bonnet in 10 inch letters. James had only owned the Audi Q7 3.0 RS7 for six weeks.
On his wife's car bonnet, vandals had scratched with 'fat s**g'.
James found the words 'black c**t' on the driver's door panel in eight inch letters and the words 'haha c**t' on the bonnet in 10 inch letters
James, who served in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan (pictured during his time in the army) said he was 'disgusted' by the attacks
'I was so shocked to see such vitriolic words on my car - I was left in disbelief,' added James, who servedin the armed forces for a decade.'
'I dont know how anyone could use such hateful words to someone else.'
A few nights before the incident, they had also received a number of phone calls where they were again subjected to racist abuse.
The attacks first began in 2011 when James and Brenda returned from holidaying in Devon to find their home broken into and ransacked.
Days later they received racist phone calls and threats that their car would be 'torched'.
James said: 'I'd just like to ask them to stop and think about what they're doing.
'I just wish the person who did this would come to our doorstep and say it to us if they have something they want to say, rather than such a cowardly, hurtful and damaging attack on our property.'
The lorry driver has been the victim of racist taunting as a child at school but had not experienced anything like this before.
The couple were first targeted by the racists vandals back in 2011 when their home was broken into and they received abusive phone calls
The couple, who have been married ten years and live in their home just as long, now feel forced to move
James, who was part of the First Battalion The Royal Regiment Off Fusiliers, said: 'Because I was adopted so young I don't know what my heritage actually is, I know very little about my past.
'I did suffer racial abuse when I was at school but I rose above that and got on with my life. But I think it's a horrible thing. These people don't understand what it can do to a person.
'Since those incidents in school I've been very lucky and I was never victim to any racism in the army.
'So to have someone do things like this to me now is horrendous. It's disgusting.'
But now James and Brenda, 48, feel enough is enough.
James said: 'It's just not something we are prepared to stand for. We want to get on with our lives, we need to get over the death of our grandson in peace.
'I never want to have to get up in the night and find someone has done this to our property ever again. The safest thing for us is just to move house unfortunately.'
Police confirmed they are now investigating the matter.
A South Yorkshire Police spokesperson said: 'A report of criminal damage to two cars was made to police on Saturday, 16 May at 2am.
'Officers are investigating and would ask anyone with information to please call 101, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111, quoting incident number 116 of 16 May 2015.'

	Fat cat removed from owners addicted to watching The Great British Bake Off

	Animal rescuers stepped in and took Tiger (pictured) to London's Mayhew Animal Home, where he has lost half of his original weight. But he still longs for cake - having become hooked on the BBC show.

Staff at the centre said that Tiger 'hated' the new diet he was put on so much that he made a beeline for the TV when the baking show came on.
They watched as the 13-year-old - who has been nicknamed 'Huggy Bear' - sat drooling at the cakes on show, and now even watches repeats.
But staff are sure he's now just viewing for 'pleasure' rather than greed, having already lost 14lbs and replaced his lazy days with hours outside chasing birds.
Tiger, who weighed more than two stone at his heaviest, was fed roast beef and pancakes by his elderly owner who previously refused to put him on a diet
A spokesman for the centre said: 'The Great British Bake Off is still Tiger's favourite programme.
'He was not too impressed with his new diet at first, but he soon got used to it.
'Although he's on a diet it doesn't stop him watching his favourite cookery programme.'
Zoe Edwards, Mayhew animal welfare manager, said affectionate Tiger is now ready for a new home.
She said: 'Tiger literally couldn't breathe when he came in, his heart was under massive strain.
'He was the most overweight cat I have ever seen and he would have died if we hadn't intervened.
'The animal welfare officers had been trying to get her [Tiger's previous owner] to reduce his food intake and weight but she just avoided our visits.
'However, on my last visit I had to remove him as he was in such distress.
'She just couldn't see the harm it was doing, she thought she was being kind.'
The newly slim Tiger the cat basks in the Spring sunshine
Being cared for atLondon's Mayhew Animal Home, Tiger has since lost half of his weight (left)...but clearly still craves his diet of cakes and roast dinners
Bosses at the animal home said that when the tabby was rescued in 2013 he was so fat he struggled to breathe and was 'at death's door', but is now a lot happier as he spends his time rolling around and chasing birds
Under the terms of the Animal Welfare Act - which states that owners must ensure the welfare of their pets - animals can be taken into care if their health is deemed to be at risk.
Since being in his rescue home, Tiger has lost more than half of his weight.
The centre added: 'His previous owner was an old lady with two other cats who also fed lots of feral cats.
'She was very fond of him but was killing him with kindness - she fed him pancakes, food that was meant for a feral cat colony and human foods such as roast dinners.'

	Lynn Watson, from Dundee, made shoes Duster the chicken out of gardening gloves to help her recover from a serious bumblefoot infection which could have killed the poorly hen.

She said: 'They're quite expensive so I used gardening gloves - ones with a rubberised grip.
'It was actually quite easy. I just looked at her feet and drew around them then chopped off the fingers.
'She wriggled a bit when I put them on.'
Woman combats chicken's sore feet by making it SHOES
Cock of the walk: Duster the chicken has a habit of jumping out of her coop rather than using the ramp, which has damaged her feet
Ms Watson made the pair of shoes out of her pink and green gardening gloves to help protect her hen's feet as they recovered
On the mend: Duster, despite the initial aversion to the shoes, is set to make a full recovery from the infection
The shoes are strapped on with Velcro so they do not fall off Duster's feet as he
pecks
his way around their garden.
But Ms Woster says Duster is not particularly impressed with her new footwear.
She
She got a bit sulky and she went in the huff.
'She sat and ignored
us
but she's walking about in them.'
When the concerned hen-owner took Duster to the vet following the surgery, she was told she had done everything right.
Ms Watson
He said that we did the right thing and just gave her antibiotics.
'But the vet had never seen a chicken in shoes before.'
Duster originally came to Ms Foster with two other hens from a chicken breeder. All three had some form of deformity - Duster had a cracked beak while another had twisted feet.
Her seven other chickens are former battery hens who were rescued.
Ms Watson said: 'They really love life - they're absolutely spoiled rotten.
'The battery farms get rid of them when they're about 18 months old as they start to moult and don't lay eggs so productivity drops. But they still keep
laying

	Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Ms Kendall was the candidate who could move the party 'beyond our comfort zone' after this month's disastrous election defeat.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

'She has no compunction in moving Labour beyond our comfort zone and is determined to build a team ready to chart a route forward.'
Mr Umunna's endorsement comes after Labour leadership rival Yvette Cooper outlined her pitch to succeed Mr Miliband - with a direct appeal to struggling families.
She said her party needed to revolutionise the way it supports parents by offering free childcare for all.
The shadow home secretary has called for a Scandinavian-style system of universal childcare, with 30 hours of free care for all pre-school youngsters over the age of two.
For younger children, Ms Cooper told The Independent there should be a new system of tax credits to cover the period after a mother finishes maternity leave.
Writing in the newspaper, Ms Cooper said the pledge would be a cornerstone of her leadership campaign.
Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham is seen as the unions' favourite for the Labour leadership and is the early frontrunner to succeed Mr Miliband
Shadow international development secretary Mary Creagh (left) is the rank outsider for the Labour leadership, while Yvette Cooper (right), who is married to Ed Balls, has pitched herself as the 'unity' candidate
She said: 'We should campaign for universal childcare - as other countries, including Scandinavia, have.
'That means breakfast clubs, after-school clubs, holiday clubs and free nursery places and childcare available full-time, not just for three and four-year-olds but two-year-olds too.'
She said Labour 'did not convince' enough voters of its commitment to families during the general election campaign, and that the party needed to demonstrate a commitment to extra support for younger families.
Ms Cooper added: 'It means recognising that when children are small, parents need more choice about returning to work, working part-time, or staying at home.'
It comes as the Queen's Speech will tomorrow set out a programme of legislation that Prime Minister David Cameron said would reach 'right across our country, into every city, every community and every home' - including promises of free childcare.
Last week Ms Cooper warned her party against swinging too far to the left or right as she stressed there was a mountain to climb to become electable again.
She said the party had to 'face some hard truths' and acknowledge that it could not repeat mistakes made under Ed Miliband, but insisted it was wrong to believe that 'there needs to be blood on the floor' for Labour to rise again.
In an apparent swipe at her main rivals in the leadership race, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham - seen as the unions' likely choice - and the Blairite Liz Kendall, Ms Cooper said 'there is no comfort blanket for us either in Labour victories or Labour defeats of the past' because 'the world has changed'.

Who are the Labour leadership frontrunners?
Andy Burnham
Labour's shadow health secretary is seen as the unions' favourite candidate
Despite being a football-mad, ale drinking northerner the Labour leadership front-runner has long been known in Westminster as Andy 'Bambi Burnham' for his fluttering, dark eyelashes and Cara Delevingne-style eyebrows.
In an online chat with Mumsnet he was asked the secret his 'sexy eyes'  and was even forced to fend off accusations that he used mascara after one appearance on Question Time.
Away from the focus on Mr Burnham's pretty boy looks, the MP for Leigh is no lightweight  having served in the Cabinet under Gordon Brown and faced furious Tory attacks over his record overseeing the Mid Staffs hospital scandal as Health Secretary.
Mr Burnham, 45, was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Cheshire by telephone engineer father and receptionist mother.
After attending state school, Mr Burnham  die-hard Everton fan, who still goes to home games with his father  studied English at Cambridge before moving to London to work in Labour politics.
It was at Cambridge that he met his Dutch wife Marie-France van Heel, who once worked in marketing for BSkyB. The couple live in his constituency with three young children.
After university he joined Tessa Jowell's team in Parliament before becoming a special adviser to Chris Smith at the Department of Culture, Media &amp; Sport.
He finally returned to the north west in 2001 becoming the MP for Leigh.
Despite being an Oxbridge-educated former special advisor  like fellow leadership contenders Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Tristram Hunt  Mr Burnham insists he represents a break from the 'metropolitan-establishment' which has dominated New Labour.
In the 2010 leadership battle he ran as the only northern candidate. He said his rivals would not do anything to change the 'top-down, London-centric way in which things have been run in recent years'.
However, his campaign fell flat with party members  finishing fourth out of five candidates with just 8.68 per cent of the vote.

Yvette Cooper
Yvette Cooper, who is married to Ed Balls, has portrayed herself as the unity candidate - who will not take the party to the right or left
It wasn't supposed to be this way. By now, Yvette Cooper was supposed to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, serving under her husband  the Prime Minister Ed Balls.
In 2010, after her political mentor Gordon Brown was forced out of Downing Street, Ms Cooper stood aside to let Mr Balls stand for the Labour leadership.
Many analysts thought Labour's power couple had chosen the wrong person.
In the end, with Diane Abbott as the only woman on the ballot paper, Mr Balls finished a distant third behind the two Milibands.
But with Mr Balls finally out of the way after being kicked out of Parliament last week, some believe Ms Cooper's time has come.
The mother of three, who reportedly burst into tears as she watched her husband's election defeat, has announced her bid to lead the party.
She is now hoping to make a 'kitchen table pitch' as a working mother who understands the concerns of ordinary families.
Launching her bid in the Daily Mirror, she rejected calls to 'go back to the remedies of the past' that worked for former prime minister Tony Blair.
Ms Cooper said she wanted Labour to 'move beyond the old labels of left and right' and be 'credible, compassionate, creative and connected to the day-to-day realities of life'.But she was left squirming in a radio interview when she refused to say Labour spent too much.
Allies say the party needs a 'credible' woman in charge  and not just someone 'with old ideas and a shiny face' - in a thinly-veiled dig at the Blairite candidate Ms Kendall.
It has been a long time coming for the 45-year-old shadow home secretary.
As the teenage daughter of a trade union leader she would reportedly tell anyone who would listen at her Hampshire comprehensive that she wanted to be prime minister  though she denies this.
She first began working for the Labour party in 1990 after a stellar academic career at Oxford, Harvard and the London School of Economics  and a brief stint working for the former US President Bill Clinton.
Ms Cooper first joined the party working for Harriet Harman before being poached by Gordon Brown.
After a brief spell working as an economic journalist for the Independent newspaper, Ms Cooper became MP for the Labour safe seat of Pontefract and Castleford in 1997  before steadily rising through the ranks, eventually becoming Gordon Brown's Treasury Secretary.
In 1998, Miss Cooper and Mr Balls married at an Eastbourne wedding attended by the new Labour aristocracy.
But her rise has not been without controversy. In September 2007, she and her husband were accused of breaking the spirit of House of Commons rules by 'flipping' their second home.They were ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing by Parliament's sleaze watchdog.

Liz Kendall
Shadow health minister Liz Kendall is seen as the Blairite candidate
Shadow health secretary Liz Kendall was first out of the blocks in the leadership race on Sunday - announcing her bid with a heavily-Blairite pitch to appeal to middle class voters.
The Leicester West MP has impressed since being elected to Parliament in 2010 - doubling her majority last week despite the party's disastrous performance across the country.
Ms Kendall, 43, grew up in comfortable middle-class Hertfordshire, attending Watford Grammar School for Girls before heading to Cambridge University.
Since entering the Commons five years ago, Ms Kendall has become a member of the so-called 'breakfast club' quartet of Labour frontbenchers along with Chuka Umunna, Emma Reynolds, and Tristram Hunt.
Ms Kendall called for the party to draw a line under Ed Miliband's leadership in a Sunday interview on the BBC.
She said: 'I think we didn't get people's trust on the economy... we didn't set out a positive enough alternative for the future.'
Ms Kendall is also an avowed rap music man and was dating the comedian Greg Davies, star of the sitcom The Inbetweeners.
He said: 'I mostly listen to rap. I do listen to some Eminem, I listen to Dr Dre  my favourite  and loads of Jay-Z, but from the good old days of The Black Album.
'I listen to a bit of Public Enemy. It's brilliant  particularly if I'm about to speak in the Chamber.'

Mary Creagh
Mother of two Mary Creagh is the outsider to win the Labour leadership
Mary Creagh is the rank outsider in the race to replace Ed Miliband  after throwing her hat into the ring with a pledge to win back middle England.
She was elected the MP for Wakefield in 2005 after leading Islington council in north London for five years.
The mother of two courted controversy in the shadow cabinet when she blamed the Thomas the Tank Engine series for the lack of female train drivers.
She also raised eyebrows after accusing her fellow Labour MPs of discriminating again her because she spoke with a middle-class, southern accent.
The Labour leadership contender  dubbed by some 'Sweary Mary' by some in Westminster over her candid way of speaking privately  claimed she was a victim of inverse snobbery because she did not speak with a 'broad regional accent'.
Ms Creagh was born and brought up in Coventry, but claimed she lost her accent while studying modern languages at Oxford University. She went on to complete a PhD in European Studies at the London School of Economics before going into politics.
In the shadow cabinet she won plaudits by attacking the Coalition's plan to sell off publicly-owned forests, forcing one of David Cameron's first u-turns.
She is married and named her two children after famous socialists - Clement, in honour of the former Labour Prime Minister Clement Atlee, and Beatrice, after social reformer Beatrice Webb.

	Anglo-Saxon warrior's helmet pieced together from scraps in Staffordshire Hoard
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3096905/Experts-piece-rare-Anglo-Saxon-warrior-s-helmet-scraps-precious-metal-Staffordshire-Hoard.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490
      </Link>
        <Description>
	Experts in Staffordshire working with the hoard (fragments pictured) said the 7th century 'warrior splendour' was likely made in workshops set up by some of England's earliest kings.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

Experts worked for three solid days to reassemble some 1,500 thin, fragile silver sheets into parts of the helmet band and other details.
THE PRECIOUS POMMEL
There are more than 70 pommels in the hoard, but the newly constructed artefact has been described as exceptional and is the first of its kind to be found.
It was reformed from 26 pieces and while Anglo-Saxon in Style, it has British or Irish art influences.
Its central garnet and glass inlaid disc can be seen to form an early Christian cross and on the other side is a motif formed of three serpents, representing both Christian and pagan beliefs.
Most unusual is the rounded hump on the pommels shoulder, known as a sword-ring  there would have been two originally, one on each shoulder.
Many swords from this period in England and Europe have such rings, but the hoard pommel is the first to have had two.
This, with its lavish ornament, points to it possibly belonging to an individual of significant status.
The painstaking job saw these fragments - many measuring less than one centimetre across and making up around a third of the Hoard in size - pieced together to reveal intricate, die-stamped designs, including on the helmet band, which ran around the circumference of the helmet.
Pieta Greaves, who is in charge of the research for the hoard told MailOnline that the detailed band would have been level with the wearer's ears.
The remarkable designs depict kneeling human warriors around the band as well as fragments showing male moustachioed faces, birds, animals and mythical beasts.
But experts have yet to tie them to the helmet.
Some of the warriors depicted have handlebar moustaches, which may hint that the style was fashionable at the time.
She told The Times: 'I don't known what [the find] will tell us about fashion of the period.
'Perhaps being able to groom yourself indicates being part of an elite -they're quite long moustaches, quite handle-bar like.'
Other depictions of warriors on other artefacts are clean shaven or have shaggy beards, suggesting that just like today, men may simply have chosen whether they had a beard or not depending on their personal preferences.
But Dr Greaves said it's possible the images are of ancestral or idealised warriors, intended to give spiritual support to the wearer.
The helmetband, depicting a frieze of warriors (pictured), is part of the incredibly rare silver helmet which is among just five previously known in Britain
Some of the warriors depicted show Anglo Saxon warriors with handlebar moustaches. It may hint that the style was fashionable at the time. Experts are unsure if this piece is from the helmet or not
Researchers have also uncovered a unique sword pommel made up of gold, silver, garnet, glass and deliberately blackened silver niello work (pictured)
She explained that similar men with handlebar moustaches are known on other Anglo Saxon objects such as a drinking horn from Sutton Hoo, suggesting they could have been used to represent an ancestor or figure from a legend.
'The helmet obviously belonged to someone of huge important, such as a king,' she said.
The designs depict kneeling human warriors around the band (pictured) as well as fragments showing male moustachioed faces, birds, animals and mythical beasts. Another part of the helmet is shown above
There are more than 70 pommels in the hoard, but the newly constructed artefact has been described as exceptional and is the first of its kind to be found. This is the back of the pommel
HOARD RESEARCH - WHAT THE EXAMINATION OF THE ARTEFACTS REVEALED
The number of artefacts in the collection now stands at 4,000, after more than the first 500 objects found were revealed in nearby fields - including a garnet bird mount.
Many broken fragments have been joined together into their original objects such as new types of sword fittings and other mounts.
Groups of sword fittings have been matched to show what original sword hilts looked like.
At least one helmet, composed of over 1,500 pieces, is contained in the treasure. Anglo-Saxon helmets are incredibly rare in Britain - only five were previously known.
The sword and weaponry fittings show for the first time the true extent of the gold wealth and aspirations of the ruling warrior class of early England. Previously, only glimpses of these warriors had been revealed in exceptional burials like Sutton Hoo.
The analysis has revealed much new information about how the objects were constructed including: the composition of the alloys used, the joining of metal with woods and animal horn plus the glues and resins made of animal and plant extracts.
A variety of types of Saxon and re-used Roman glass has also been identified.
They also reassembled a pommel -the part of the sword that fits at the end of a sword-grip- made up of gold, silver, garnet, glass and deliberately blackened silver niello work, which is a black inlay formed from copper, silver, and lead sulphides.
Experts say the find suggests the coming together of Anglo-Saxon and British or Irish high cultures.
Chris Fern, project archaeologist, said: 'The gold and silver war-gear was probably made in workshops controlled by some of England's earliest kings to reward warriors that served those rulers, when multiple kingdoms fought for supremacy.
'The skill of the craftsmen is equally thrilling to behold, with many of the finds decorated with pagan and Christian art, designed to give spiritual protection in battle.
The largest collection of Anglo-Saxon artefacts ever found
The hoard was discovered near the village of Hammerwich (pictured) in a farmer's field next to the A5 in July 2009 by treasure hunter Terry Herbert. A second batch was found nearby in November 2012
Last year, 4,000 pieces of the Staffordshire Hoard were been brought back together for the first time, allowing experts (pictured) to shed some light on life in the dark ages. They recently finished cleaning the artefacts, which  range from fragments of helmet to gold sword decorations
The skills of the ancient jewellers are easily apparent with threads of gold less than a millimetre thick wound into intricate shapes (shown left), and tiny pieces of red and blue garnet stone that have been carved into elaborate, curved shapes to fit into decorations (right)
The experts previously revealed that the vast majority of the Hoard would have been owned or used by soldiers, showing that it was not just kings who went into battle with their weaponry and armour decorated with gold and intricate jewellery. An example is shown
THE DISCOVERY OF THE HOARD
A treasure hunter made the find in 2009.
It  was the most valuable hoard of Saxon gold in history - estimated to be worth 3.3million ($5 million) - and includes 500  pieces such as gold sword hilts, jewels from Sri Lanka and early  Christian crosses.
The 1,300-year-old treasure was discovered by unemployed Terry Herbert in July in a field owned by a friend in Staffordshire.
Within  days, the 55-year-old former coffin factory worker from Walsall had  filled 244 bags with gold objects weighing in at more than 11lbs (5kg).
Mr  Herbert, who bought an old metal detector for 2.50 18 years ago, said  he was overwhelmed by the find  regarded as one of the most important  in decades.
I have this  phrase that I say sometimes  spirits of yesteryear take me where the  coins appear  but on that day I changed coins to gold, he said.
I  dont know why I said it that day, but I think somebody was listening  and directed me to it. Maybe it was meant to be, maybe the gold had my  name on it all along.
I was going to bed and in my sleep I was seeing gold items.
The jewels are thought to have come from Sri Lanka - carried to Europe by traders.
The gold probably came from the Byzantine Empire, the eastern remnant of the Roman Empire based in what is now Istanbul.
The treasure dates from 675 and 725AD, the time of Beowulf  the great Anglo-Saxon poem.
'The newly recognised pommel is truly exciting. It combines multiple different styles of ornament, much in the same way as the earliest 7th century illuminated manuscripts do, like the Book of Durrow.'
The 1,300-year-old treasure - which includes up to 4,000 pieces - was discovered by unemployed Terry Herbert in July 2010 in a field owned by a friend in Staffordshire.
Another 90 pieces were recovered from the same field three years later.
The haul includesgold, silver and some copper alloy objects as well asbeautiful gold sword hilts, jewels from Sri Lanka, exquisitely carved helmet decorations and early Christian crosses.
In total the hoard includes more than 11lb (5kg) of gold, 3.3lbs (1.5kg) of silver and thousands of small garnets.
It was valued at 3.3 million ($5 million) by independent experts at the British Museum - the most valuable treasure discovery ever made.
Historic England has so far allocated 400,000 ($616,000) to help conserve the hoard, including work to clean the silver, gold and garnet objects and fragments.
Birmingham City Council and Stoke-on-Trent City Council, which jointly own the hoard, now aim to raise 120,000 for further work to assemble more artefacts from individual pieces of metalwork.
The sword and weaponry fittings have shown for the first time the true extent of the gold wealth and aspirations of the ruling warrior class of early England.
The analysis has also revealed much new information about how the objects were constructed including the composition of the alloys used.
Duncan Wilson, Historic England's chief executive, said: 'Since its discovery, the Staffordshire Hoard and the stories behind it have captured the public imagination.
'As technology and research methods develop we are able to discover more and more, and share the results, but more money needs to be raised to capitalise fully on this rich potential.'
Both the items have now been put on display at Birmingham's Museum and Art Gallery.
Members of the public can make donations to the conservation work here .
There is evidence of Christian and pagan beliefs in the Hoard. These two artefacts, pictured left and right, are examples of early Christian crosses
At the time it was hidden, Staffordshire was the heartland of Mercia, an aggressive kingdom. The gold could have been collected during wars with the kingdoms of Northumbria and East Anglia. Some appears to have been deliberately removed from the objects to which they were attached and twisted (shown)

	Hardwick man to pull down treehouse because he had no planning permission
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3097317/Father-three-ordered-pull-treehouse-built-children-didn-t-planning-permission.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490

        <Description>
	Andrew Eddy of Hardwick, Gloucester, pictured, has been ordered to demolish his children's tree house because he did not apply for planning permission for the £400 structure as it was more than 30cm from the ground.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Stroud District Council branded Mr Eddy's creation as a 'shed held up with scaffolding'.
However, Mr Eddy said he only put up the three-foot shed as it was safer than a structure left by the previous occupants.
He said he wanted somewhere safe for his children Chanikan, 11, Elizabeth, four, and Lewis, two.
The council claimed the treehouse has a 'substantial and overbearing effect' on neighbouring properties
Mr Eddy has been ordered to remove the tree house within a month if he does not appeal
Mr Eddy said he surrounded the structure with scaffolding to make it even safer for his children.
However, the gas engineer said he was stunned when he received a planning enforcement notice from the council after a neighbour informed them of the treehouse.
He said: 'I couldn't believe it - I thought it was a joke.
'They said anything more than 30cm off the ground needs planning permission.
'It seems as though all common sense has gone out the window and to threaten prosecution is ridiculous.
'We are talking about a treehouse here, a playhouse for children, a temporary structure.
'They will be devastated if we have to take it down.'
A platform was already in the tree when Andrew and wife Nitaya, 33, moved in two years ago and when his kids started using it, he decided to make it more secure.
More than a year ago he installed some scaffolding over two weekends and gave the platform sides and a roof, so his kids could play more safely, paying 400.
TREE HOUSE RULES EXPLAINED
Since 1999, all structures more than 30cm from the ground have required planning permission
A tree house must be less than 4 metres high to the top of a ridged roof if beyond two metres of the boundary
The structure must be less than 2.5 metres high if within two metres of the boundary
It must be five metres away from the house
It must not exceed 30 square metres
Four months later he was visited by a council planning officer after a neighbour complained but he claims he was told they would take no action.
He said: 'They replied saying it should have planning permission but we won't do anything because it's such a small thing, and I thought nothing more of it.'
But he then got the planning enforcement notice earlier this month and will have to tear it down or face prosecution.
Disappointed Andrew said: 'They say they think it overlooks the other gardens but you can't even see it through the canopy of the tree which completely covers it up.
'I wish the neighbours had just come to me and said something straight away.
'I think it is a bit ridiculous. It is not like it is constantly in use - the kids only use it on the nice days when it is light enough.
'It is no different if the children are playing in the tree or in a treehouse.
'So does this mean the tree has to be cut down too?
'What is it they find so offensive about the sight of children playing?'
Andrew has lodged an appeal against the planning notice.
Stroud District Council said: 'The treehouse in question is a shed held up by scaffolding and is clearly visible from neighbouring properties.'

A journalist takes photographs of the former care home in Lushan County, where firefighters managed to extinguish the inferno after less than an hour - but the care home was already almost completely destroyed
Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered 'all-out efforts' to care for those who escaped and the bereaved relatives of those who didn't
A digger at the site begins the clean-up operation, while investigators attempt to determine what went wrong, and what could have been done to help the patients
The accident site. Photographs of the blaze were circulated online last night, which showed a large column of thick, black smoke rising from behind a nearby petrol station
Photographs were circulated online of the blaze, which showed a large column of thick black smoke rising from behind a nearby petrol station.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out efforts to care for the injured and the bereaved relatives.
The rest home project was approved by the local civil affairs authorities in late 2010.
Search-and-rescue teams pick through the wreckage of the care home. China is struggling to cope under the pressure of its rapidly-growing elderly population
A metal cot left behind in the wreckage at the site of the fire. Estimates say that one in four people in China will be over the age of 60 by 2030
Nothing was left standing after the blaze swept through the complex, where 51 patients lived
The cause of the fire is not yet known, but an investigation has been called for to find out what went wrong.
China is buckling under the strain of caring for its rapidly-growing elderly population, which accounted for 16 per cent of the population by the end of 2014.
One in four Chinese will be older than 60 by 2030, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs
Fires and industrial accidents are relatively common in China, where standards of safety can be poor.
A fire at a poultry plant killed 120 people in the northeastern province of Jilin in June 2013. Reports at the time claimed the managers had locked doors inside the factory to stop workers going to the toilet, which accounted for the very high death toll.
In July 2013, 11 nursing home patients were killed in a fire in Heilongjiang province. The fire was found to be started by a patient, who died in the fire, in a row over money.
In February this year, a fire at a warehouse in Guangdong province killed at least 17 people.

According to The Sowetan newspaper, the woman is expected to plead guilty to charges of compelled rape at Alexandra Magistrate's Court in Johannesburg today.
If so she faces a maximum sentence of life in jail because of the young ages of the victims.
The paper also reports that the principal is still running the creche, but authorities would not say if the two children are still attending.
The 68-year-old allegedly found the children having sex in a toilet, then told them to come to her office where they were forced to repeat the act as she filmed it in order to show their parents
Thebe Mohatle, spokesman for the Gauteng department of social development, could not confirm if the school was being investigated or if the principal had been disciplined outside of the courtroom.
In another shocking twist, Dumisile Nala, national executive officer of Childline, said the youngsters' behaviour was 'nothing unusual', adding that they were likely acting out something they saw on TV.
However, she went on to say that the principal's reaction had been 'unacceptable' and 'really bizarre', adding that the reenactment would have been far more traumatic than the initial act.
She also questioned how two children of the same sex had ended up in the same bathroom, and recommended that the pair be taken for counselling.

	The Football Association will blast two FA Cup final tickets to the verge of space from the centre circle of Wembley Stadium at 6am tomorrow offering fans the ultimate stratospheric treasure hunt.

The balloon and the special cargo will be tracked using GPS signals which will be relayed to anxious fans tomorrow over Twitter.
Lucy Roberts-Hartley, Marketing Manager for The FA Cup, said:
'This seasons competition has truly been one to remember - on and off the pitch. The Cup has travelled to the South Pole and on the pitch weve seen some of the most memorable matches in FA Cup history.
'Sending the final pair of tickets into space is a great way to finish the off-pitch adventure, we hope the fan that discovers the tickets also enjoys an out-of-this-world match on Saturday.'
The tickets will reach 36km in height before the balloon explodes and sends the package back to earth
Alex Baker of Sentintospace.com said he expected the balloon will travel approximately 100 miles before the tickets fall to earth.
He said the early morning launch was necessary to avoid interfering with busy flight lanes.
'Tomorrow we are using helium to fill the balloon. Sometimes we can use hydrogen. Hydrogen is a better gas as it produces more lift for the same volume, but it has its own problems.
'After launch, the balloon will go up to approximately 36km. As it ascends the air pressure outside drops and balloon expands. At launch, it is approximately two metres in diameter. At 36km it will have expanded to around 10 metres where it will explode.
'The package with the ticket will plummet at almost 200 metres per second at that altitude, but once the air pressure increases, the speed will decrease and the parachute will deploy.
'We expect it to be back on the ground between 8.30am and 9am.'

TV presenterAnthea Turner,54, answersour healthquiz.
CAN YOU RUN UP STAIRS?
I run everywhere, including the stairs (usually two at a time). I go to the gym about three times a week and mainly use weights for toning and shaping. I'm fairly knowledgeable about the type of exercise my body needs, having done classical ballet for a number of years.
GET YOUR FIVE A DAY?
I certainly do, as I love fruit and veg.
EVER DIETED?
Never! I think people mess around too much with their metabolic rate. I'm 5 ft 6 in and weigh 55 kg (8 st).
ANY VICES?
I love crisps, especially chicken-flavoured ones. I also love red wine, peanuts and dark chocolate. And I occasionally enjoy fish and chips - there is no greater meal in the world.
ANY FAMILY AILMENTS?
None, thank goodness. My parents are both in their 80s and in good health. My grandparents didn't die until their 90s. In fact, my grandfather died just before his 100th birthday.
POP ANY PILLS?
I take multivitamins as an insurance policy. Once every two weeks, I go to a London clinic for a treatment called RevivMe. You're connected to a drip, which feeds electrolytes, vitamins and antioxidants into your veins to boost your energy levels.

	Natalie Penney (pictured), of Hyde, collapsed at home after taking tablets containing ephedrine which she'd been able to buy online. The lethal pills have since left her with permanent heart damage.

She said: 'I never had a good education about food. All I knew is there were other girls skinnier than me on nights out and I wanted to look like them, but still allow myself pizzas and chips at the end of the night.
'I didn't think twice about taking the pills, even though they came in an unlabelled pot and only cost 25 for a two-month supply.
'I took one each morning instead of having breakfast and I noticed a difference almost immediately.'
Working as an assistant accountant at the time, Natalie noticed her heart racing at work one day a few weeks later.
She said: 'The only way to describe it is as though I was running around the office at 100mph, when actually I was just walking. Everything felt sped up.
Once giving up the lethal pills, Natalie decided to adopt a healthy lifestyle, eating better foods and cutting down on alcohol. These photos show how her weight then dropped naturally as she aimed for a better body
According to Natalie, boozy night's out were leaving her feeling overweight and bloated. It was then that she opted to buy diet pills on the internet. However, after passing out she had to be fitted with a heart monitor. Doctors later revealed that the tablets she was taking contained a deadly chemical banned in Britain
'I stopped taking the pills after six weeks because I was happy with my size, but the symptoms carried on. I hadn't told anyone about it, so I just tried to ignore them.
'Some days it would be my heart racing, other times I wouldn't be able to sleep, and I noticed the sweating nearly every day. I played netball and it became so uncomfortable.'
Natalie tried to ignore her symptoms, but one afternoon she woke up sprawled on the floor at her Hyde home.
Natalie had to wear a heart monitor for two years and see a specialist consultant every four weeks during that time to assess her condition
She said: 'It was just me and my mum living together at the time and she was out one day. All I remember is waking up on the living room floor with our sausage dog Dexter licking my face.
'I tried to stay calm but I was really short of breath and dizzy, so I rang 999. When I told the operator about my past symptoms, they sent an ambulance immediately.
'I was scared but it was a relief to think I might finally find out what was wrong with me. They kept me in overnight and after doing some tests, said I might be suffering from atrial tachycardia, or abnormal and increased heart rhythm.'
Natalie went back in for blood tests and scans over the following weeks and had the diagnosis confirmed - but she was stunned when doctors asked if drug-taking could be to blame.
She denied having ever taken drugs, but suddenly remembered her diet pills and gave them in to be analysed.
She said: 'I fished out the little tub of pills from the back of my wardrobe and when the results came back, I was so worried.
'As well as aspirin and caffeine, one of the main ingredients was something called ephedrine or ephedra, which is illegal in the UK.
'I was ashamed and horrified about what I might have done to myself, as a result of wanting to be a bit thinner.'
Natalie had to wear a heart monitor for two years and see a specialist consultant every four weeks during that time to assess her condition.
She has radically changed her diet and now often does 90-day stints without alcohol, determined to look after her health more sensibly.
She said: 'My heart doctor said the problem will always be there, but not as severe. I still suffer with anxiety and my heart races when I'm stressed.
WHAT IS EPHEDRINE? THE DEADLY DIET PILL SIMILAR TO AMPHETAMINES
Ephedrine is a dangerous natural compound, used - within small, controlled amounts - as a stimulant, concentration aid, decongestant and appetite suppressant. It has a similar chemical structure to amphetamines and works by increasing the activity of cell responses in G proteincoupled receptors, through which many over-the-counter medications enter the body's nervous system.
To that accord, ephedrine is a central nervous system stimulant similar to amphetamine.
It's main herb  is ephedra, or ma huang, which comes from a shrub like plant grown widely in Asia.
Many studies into the drug have found that it can produce a wide array of possible side effects, including anxiety, insomnia, hypertension, tachycardia, psychosis, kidney damage, dependency, heart attacks, strokes and even death.
Ephedrine burns fat by stimulating the nervous system and your circulation, in a process that is called thermogenesis. If consumed in large amounts, it will lead to several of the above listed side effects.
Routine reliance on the compound will lead to the heart being placed under so much pressure that it eventually wouldnt be able to cope.
It is illegal for shopkeepers and chemists to sell it in large quantities within the UK because of its extremely dangerous side effects. However, the drug is sold over-the-counter because it is intended for short-term use as a nasal decongestant.
'They also said it's a good job I stopped taking the pills when I did and passing out was a blessing in disguise.
'Now I'm a marketer with a health company - where I met my boyfriend Jonathan - and the two of us are all about clean living and exercise. I'd never dream of trying a quick fix to lose weight ever again.
'I just hope other people can learn from my mistake. All I'd say is if you can't pronounce something, don't put it in your body.
'Somebody could just take one dodgy diet pill and be paying the price for the rest of their life.'
Just last month, a 21-year-old student died after taking a lethal dose of diet pills that she too bought online.
Eloise Parry, known as Ella, 'burned up from the inside' after swallowing the highly-toxic substance known as Dinitrophenol, or DNP.

She said: From a young age, Ive always been an atheist. I chose non-religious schools for my children so they can make their own minds up when theyre older if they want to practise a religion.
A RIGHT TO PULL OUT OF LESSONS
All schools in England must provide RE lessons - but parents can withdraw their children from them for any reason.
Guidance states: The use of the right to withdraw should be at the instigation of parents... No reasons need be given.
It adds: Parents have the right to choose whether or not to withdraw their child from RE without influence from the school.'
I dont think RE should be on the curriculum - it should be replaced with first aid, which is more useful in life. I was shocked to receive a letter for a school trip to a mosque, church and synagogue.
I absented my child and have been debating for the best part of a year whether to take my children out of RE lessons.
'I respect that people choose to Christen their children, but I would also like them to respect that I have no interest in religion.
'Also, why should I have to take my children to get baptised to get them into good schools?
Education: Miss Baker claims to be offended by people who preach in public, and might remove her daughter from religious education lessons at Elm Wood Primary School (pictured)in Middleton, Manchester
Nearby: Miss Baker has also considered taking her son out of RE lessons at Middleton Technology School
Miss Baker, who lives with Benn, Katie, and her partner Craig Livesey, 47, added: Its all about choice - I dont go banging on peoples doors or preaching in town centres about it.

She has refused to be a godmother to a relatives child and believes people with no faith should not have to eat halal or kosher food.
Miss Baker spoke out after receiving a letter from Elm Wood about trips to places of worship.
She posted her comments about the trips on Facebook, provoking a debate - with some agreeing it is a parents right to choose and others saying it is important to understand others beliefs.

	Islamic State's Libyan franchise have been showing off new photographs of a deadly explosives workshop hidden near the Libyan city of Tripoli. All the devices appear to be homemade.

Close up shots of metal sheets using soldered together and hammered into place show the high production demands of the workshop.
Lying outside, an selection of aerial bombs have been stockpiled. With touches of rust, the large bombs do not appear to be newly made nor improvised like the rest of the arsenal.
Described as a tour inside one of the booby-trap workshops in the state of Tripoli, the photos epitomise the growing threat of violence currently engulfing the troubled North African country.
The bomb makers appear skilled and well crafted in their deadly trade of building bombs to kill and maim their enemies
The workshop's floor appears to be precariously littered with dozens of pressure bombs. Each of the small circular frames are packed full of explosives and shrapnel
Inside, the floor is precariously littered with dozens of pressure bombs. Each of the small circular frames are packed full of explosives and shrapnel, killing or maiming anyone who mishandles the deadly devices.
Homemade grenades with long yellow fuses also appear to have been constructed in the explosives workshop.
Taped together with different coloured gaffer tape, the crude bombs lie next to an array of cube like bombs, heavily wrapped in bubble wrap.
Other shells have been carefully stacked next to the grenades, clearly labelled on the side in yellow writing, 'TNT.'
Close up shots of metal sheets using soldered together and hammered into place show the high production demands of the workshop.
Empty shells lie in huge piles outside the workshop, hidden somewhere near the Libyan city of Tripoli
Another worker is shown using precision tools including an axil grinder and a soldering iron to carefully craft the bombs together.
Wired up triggers and pull pins for roadside bombs also appear to be produced in mass quantities by the Libyan bombmakers.
The photos come at a time when Islamic State continue to build a dangerous reputation in North Africa, particularly in the war torn country of Libya.

Piles of cigarettes, recreational drugs and alcohol were burnt in a large public demonstration by Islamic State in the city centre last week.
Four local men were also recently whipped in public for the 'obscene act' of drinking alcohol.

	Ryanair reaps benefits of being nicer to customers with 66% jump in profits

	The budget airline - famed for its off-hand treatment of passengers and sneaky fees - dramatically changed its tune after a series of profit warnings last year.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>RYANAIR'S CURIOUS REVENUE-BOOSTING IDEAS (BEFORE ALWAYS GETTING BETTER WAS BORN)
Pay-per-pee
In 2009, Mr OLeary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight.
'Were thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to spend a pound to spend a penny.' When asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone wanted to pay 5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would wipe their bums for a fiver.'
Vertical seats
A year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts.
His theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers and slash costs by 20 per cent.
Who needs co-pilots?
Mr O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the first fella doesnt fall asleep and knock over one of the computer controls'.
He said aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight.
After two profits warnings last year, O'Leary promised that the airline would 'stop unnecessarily p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy.' 
Since then, Ryanair has rolled out a string of initiatives to win over fliers, including allocated seating, new seats with more legroom, improved in-flight meals, extra carry-on luggage and more business-friendly schedules.
It is also promising new aircraft interiors and updated uniforms for cabin crew, with other plans under a second year of its customer-focused programme.
All this is a far cry from the company's previous revenue-boosting ideas.
In the past Ryanair talked of replacing 10 rows of seats with a standing area, as well as introducing a coin-operated toilet on some planes.
Earlier this month, reports surfaced that passengers on-board a recent Ryanair flight from Murica, Spain to London suffered an unwelcome surprise when crew members discovered the plane had departed without any toilet paper.
At the time, a Ryanair spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'This very rare and regrettable stock shortage (on the last flight last Sunday evening) was caused by the failure of our handling agents in Murcia to deliver toilet rolls and milk sachets that had been ordered on the turnaround in Murcia.'
Ryanair also used its annual results to have its say in the Greater-London runway debate.
The company said: 'We believe that the market should be free to develop three new runways, one each at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted which is the only long term solution to the capacity crisis in the South East, and which will encourage all three airports to deliver additional capacity quickly and cost efficiently.'
To increase capacity, Ryanair said it had ordered 183 Boeing 737-800 planes for delivery up to 2018, and 200 Boeing 737 Max 200s from 2019-2023.
Controversial figure:After two profits warnings, last year Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary promised that the airline would 'stop unnecessarily p****** people off' and treating customers 'like the enemy'
Ryanair said: 'Our summer 2015 fleet of 320 aircraft is insufficient to handle the demand for Ryanairs low fares.'
The new planes will be cheaper to finance and operate, with eight more seats and engines 18 per cent more efficient than their predecessors, the company said.
The airline's unit costs fell by 5 per cent last year and, according to the firm, it benefited from lower unhedged fuel prices.
Shareholders also appear to be enjoying the fruits of the firm's  turnaround plans.
In February 2015, the airline paid its third 'special' dividend of520million (0.37 per share).
The group cautioned that it could face tough competition amid an industry-wide move to slash prices, which could impact its business over the winter season.
It said: 'It would be foolish not to expect some irrational pricing response from competitors who cannot compete with our lowest costs and fares.'
Keith Bowman of Hargreaves Lansdown said: 'The group's softer customer approach appears to be reaping rewards.
'Market share gains are being made, forward bookings are ahead of last year, while new aircraft orders have been made in order to help underpin future growth.'
Toilet troubles: The toilet on board the Ryanair flight this month effectively became redundant after toilet paper was not delivered to the aircraft (file photo)
Ryanair has a 29.8 per cent stake in Irish airline Aer Lingus, which it has made previous unsuccessful attempts to takeover.
Today, the Irish government is to discuss the potential sale of its 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to IAG.
In its results, Ryanair said: 'The UK CMAs 2013 divestment ruling under which this UK regulator orders one Irish airline to reduce its minority stake in another, solely on the basis of secret evidence that no other airline would bid for Aer Lingus while Ryanair held a minority 29.8% shareholding, has now been hopelessly disproven by IAGs offer.'
The airline added: 'The Board of Ryanair will consider any offer (should we receive one) from IAG on its merits, if or when it is received.'
Ryanair remains one of the worst ranked brands in the world by customers, second only to insurance company AXA.
Despite recent efforts to transform its reputation, the budget airline was one of the worst-performing brands overall in Siegel+Gale's 2014 simplicity index.
In a survey of over 12,000 customers in eight countries, Ryanair was named the second worst-ranked brand, based on ease of customer use of a company's products, services, interactions and communications.
Shares in Ryanair were up 0.62, or 5.7 per cent, at 11.54 at 10am.

The girl, who said she didn't even know it was a crime, said: 'Some of the pictures are revolting.
'I've added boys on there who seemed nice when I started chatting to them, but soon enough they were just sending me disgusting picture after disgusting picture.'
Web safety campaigner Alexis Vanni said parents should engage with children if they discover they have been involved in sexting.
She said: 'If you discover your child has sexted, don't shame them, which can drive the behaviour underground.
Northumbria police said they launched 18 probes last year over alleged so-called sexting. They handed out cautions to a ten-year-old and 12-year-old after they sent images to an 11-year-old girl (file picture)
'Explain the risks - you never know what can happen once they are sent.'
Schoolchildren could face a criminal record if they send explicit pictures of themselves by text message or over social media.
Sharing explicit images of under-18s is an offence even if they are taken by the youngsters themselves.
Nationally, four in ten teachers said they were aware of pupils swapping explicit photographs, according to a survey last year.
The Internet Watch Foundation warned many images shared on the web reappear on other sites after being copied or hacked and are sold to paedophiles.

	The corporation spent £5.5m last year on hiring firms to advise on health, safety and 'talent' - including whether the likes of Graham Norton and Gary Lineker are worth their generous salaries.

'The BBC must come clean on what these individuals are contributing because if this uncertainty continues, sympathy for the TV tax will wane.'
Tory MP Andrew Bridgen added that the revelations reiterated the need for the licence fee to be reformed.
In total, the BBC hired 11 firms to give guidance on area such as finance, HR, health and safety and 'change management'. The firms included well-known market leaders, including Deloitte, KPMG and PWC.
Critics have blasted the spend as something out of the comedy show W1A (pictured),the BBC2 mockumentary about life at the corporation
According to the corporation's own figures,  1.8m was spent on finance consultancy, while more than 1.6m was given to the area of 'Future Media'. Nearly half a million was spent on 'strategy'.
In contrast, just 220 was spent on BBC Wales.
A BBC spokesman insisted that the money spent on external companies saved the BBC money.
They added that the external spend was a 'good thing' because it provides 'independent assurance' which helps the BBC become 'more efficient'.
'On occasion, just like any other organisation, we use external companies for specialist services,' they said.
'This saves the BBC millions of pounds because it is cheaper than employing permanent, full-time staff to carry out work which could only last a short period.'
A spokesman also said it was exceeding its target of trying to save 700m.
The spending was disclosed by the BBC in response to a Freedom Of Information Request.

Guns and ammunition are also seen strewn across the floor of the warehouse-style building, emphasising the arsenal of weaponry that the terror group now has at its disposal.
The sickening boast comes as the terror group continues its violent assault on towns which lie between Fallujah and Ramadi, the latter of which was overrun last week following days of  bloody clashes.
Since seizing the city, in what was a huge blow to Iraq, ISIS fighters have been pushing forward in the direction of militant-held Fallujah in a bid to take more territory in Anbar province that would bring them closer to Baghdad.

'And they agreed that both countries should continue talks with the moderate Syrian opposition as part of this effort.'
Relations on Syria have been at rock bottom since the civil war started in 2011.
Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad counts Moscow as his staunchest ally.
In 2013 Mr Cameron accused Mr Putin of having the blood of Syrian children on his hands by backing the dictator who has massacred his own people.
The pair agreed to restart the dialogue on dealing with the rise of Islamic State (ISIS), which poses a threat to both countries (file picture)
But the rise of ISIS has raised the prospect of possible co-operation.
Downing Street said the prime minister warned Mr Putin that any deal must include the removal of President Assad. Sources said the two men agreed to 'continue talks with the moderate Syrian opposition'.
Mr Cameron also criticised Russia's continued occupation of the Crimea and its aggression in Ukraine.
Downing Street said there remained 'deep differences' over Russia's role in the instability of its neighbour 'but that the priority now must be to deliver full implementation of the Minsk agreement.
Mr Cameron also expressed hope that the two countries 'could find other issues where the UK and Russia could work together on matters of mutual interest' in the years ahead, the spokesman said.

The royal osteopath is ready to check the Queen's back can take the strain of the Imperial State Crown ahead of the opening of Parliament
The Imperial State Crown is transported today from the Tower of London to Buckingham Palace in preparation for the State Opening of Parliament tomorrow.
The Queen likes it to arrive early so the Crown Jeweller, Martin Swift, can give it the once over. The monarch will then walk around the palace wearing it for at least two thirty-minute sessions, so her hairdresser and osteopath can gauge the effects it has on HM's head and back.
It's feared the 2.5lb crown  lightened and 'feminised' when she took the throne  may have to be carried in front of her in future. Expect intense competition among flunkeys for this honour.
Mary Lindell found post-war fame as a survivor of Ravensbruck concentration camp, hailed for running Allied escape routes in occupied France. A 1991 film based on her autobiography, One Against The Wind, starred Judy Davis and Kate Beckinsale.
Now a book by Marie-Laure Le Foulon contradicts her postwar claims. Lady Mensonges  Fausse Heroine de la Rsistance asserts that Lindell's accounts are a mix of self-glorifying exaggeration and invention.
President de Gaulle's niece Genevieve was one Ravensbruck survivor who was always suspicious of her. At the weekend, she was admitted to the Panthon in Paris, together with three other real Rsistance heroes.
Shirley MacLaine, 81, recalls missing out on the lead role in hit 1973 horror film The Exorcist. 'Bill Blatty wrote it for me,' she says. Ms MacLaine, pictured, adds: 'I was under contract to Lew Grade at the time. So I had to show him the script. He said, 'What the f***?' So I never made the film.' Ellen Burstyn earned an Oscar nomination for the part.

The item is similar to another lock of Mozart's hair, passed down from the mistress of one of Mozart's sons, which sold in 2002 at Sotheby's for 38,240 - double the pre-sale estimate.
The pieces are on public exhibition at Sotheby's galleries in New Bond Street, London until Wednesday, ahead of the auction on Thursday.

MOZART DIED AT 35 'BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH SUN'
Died young: Mozart died at just 35 years old
If only Mozart had spent a little more time outdoors enjoying the sunshine  because then we might have had a few more masterpieces.
In 2011 scientists concluded that the composer, who died at just 35, did not get enough sunlight.
He lived in Austria, which was darker than most of Europe, and would work through the night and sleep during the day.
This prevented his body from producing sufficient levels of vitamin D.
Mozart suffered illness throughout his life, including kidney disease, smallpox, typhoid fever, tonsillitis and strep throat.
Retired Nasa scientist Dr William Grant, believes that vitamin D deficiency was the underlying cause of his poor health and early death.
Dr Grant said: Almost every disease has a vitamin D connection. If only Mozart had known about vitamin D and had access to supplements, he could have doubled his lifetimes output of work.
The sunshine vitamin is essential for bone health and is produced when the skin is exposed to the ultraviolet B sunrays.

Claim:Nigel Slater believes our growing appetite for everything from curry to pizza means we might be missing out on some classic tastes of our own
The zing of chilli and the sizzle of exotic spices are a big part of Nigel Slaters cooking.
But the TV chef whose recipes are inspired by cuisines all over the world believes we shouldnt forget what we do best  simple British cooking.
Our growing appetite for everything from curry to pizza means we might be missing out on some classic tastes of our own, he says.
Mr Slater, who freely admits he didnt venture much beyond meat and two veg until his 20s, says the influx of dishes from around the world means we could be forgetting about the gorgeous produce from our own back yard.
With British lamb, tomatoes, apples, asparagus and summer berries all within easy reach on supermarket shelves, Mr Slater told the Radio Times: We arguably have better access to this countrys finest ingredients than at any other time in our history.
Our heritage of producing good ingredients and cooking them simply has never been in such good stead and yet, how many times a week do we eat non-native food at home?
The pasta suppers and cheese-laden pizzas, the curries from India, Vietnam and Thailand and the noodle and rice dishes from China and Japan.
'In the course of a week it seems that most of us eat more ethnic food than food from our own shores.
In his new series, Eating Together, which begins next Monday on BBC1, the 57-year-old cook explores how multi-culturalism has changed British food and increased our national repertoire.

	Sue Berelowitz gets redundancy package and then strolls back in by RICHARD LITTLEJOHN

	Sue Berelowitz was allowed to take voluntary redundancy from her £99,333-a-year role as Deputy Children's Commissioner. She received a golden goodbye of £134,000.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

This is the same woman who was criticised for her 'highly emotional' conclusions about grooming by predominantly Pakistani predators  crimes for which dozens of men from all over the country have subsequently been convicted.
Miss Berelowitz, 61, will work up to nine days a month, which means she will be able to earn as much as she did when she was on full-time staff.
Nice work if you can get it. And you can get it if you are lucky enough to be employed as a public sector bureaucrat. After all, it's only taxpayers' money.
The worst example of this contempt for the paying public was the shameless Sharon Shoesmith, the Haringey social services chief who was sacked after presiding over the Baby P scandal.
Instead of crawling away under the nearest stone and staying there, Shoesmith brazenly portrayed herself as the victim  not the child who had been tortured to death on her watch  and was eventually given a 679,000 pay-off.
We've seen numerous reports of senior managers taking fat redundancy packages one day, only to re-emerge in a similar job the following Monday. The NHS is one giant Pullman-class gravy train for healthcare 'professionals'  Britain's most blatant Bisto Kids.
An in-depth audit by the Mail Investigations Unit recently revealed how NHS bosses had awarded themselves 35 million in pay rises over the past year  at a time when the health service was supposed to be facing a financial crisis. Many who had previously been full-time salaried employees had baled out with a platinum parachute and then been re-employed in the same job as freelance consultants on up to 5,000 a day.
One of them was paid 25,000 for two months' work  but spent much of that time shuttling between a villa in Spain and a health spa in California. Another earned 1.26 million in a single year, while her failing NHS trust declared a loss of 4.4 million and was investigated for disturbing death and infection rates.
The worst example of this contempt for the paying public was the shameless Sharon Shoesmith, the Haringey social services chief who was sacked after presiding over the Baby P scandal
Sharon Shoesmith reveals on Newsnight how she felt like victim
The sense of entitlement among the public sector professional class is simply staggering and utterly unjustified. A culture has been allowed to develop in which failure and incompetence bring fabulous financial rewards.
The entire public sector seems to be run for the benefit of the people who work in it.
Only yesterday we learned that, according to the Government's workplace illness adviser Dame Carol Black, public sector employees take 24 per cent more 'sickies' than their private sector counterparts.
Dame Carol said there was 'undoubtedly a correlation' between the extended length of time Government staff receive full pay and benefits while off sick and the scale of their absenteeism.
But the Cabinet Office refused to investigate the link because it was a political 'hot potato'.
Sounds about right. Too close to home. It's not in civil servants' interests to highlight the favourable employment conditions they enjoy at taxpayers' expense compared with those who work for private firms.
So it's not surprising also to learn that the Treasury rubber-stamped the Berelowitz deal during the run-up to the General Election without getting ministerial approval. Officials claim that they were 'unaware' that she was being immediately rehired as a consultant.
Someone must have been aware. She didn't just turn up at reception the following day on the off-chance there might be a bit of freelance work going.
'Remember me? I used to work here until yesterday. I was at a bit of a loose end and wondered if you might need a hand. You do? Marvellous. I can start immediately.'
The Office of the Children's Commissioner is now lauching an inquiry into whether Miss Berelowitz can be made to repay her redundancy money. Perhaps they will ask her to investigate herself.
Call it 960 a day for cash.

The 'savage cuts' in the NHS must be much worse than we thought.
A surgeon is under investigation after allegedly using a rusty hacksaw to amputate a pensioner's leg.
Halfway through the operation, his knife hit a metal plate. You'd think they might have taken an X-ray first, just in case.
With no suitable instrument available at the hospital, a member of staff was dispatched to B&amp;Q to buy a tool able to cut through metal.
Unfortunately, the DIY superstore had shut for the night and he returned empty-handed.
A source at Ayr Hospital said that as the patient was already prepped and anaesthetised, a decision was taken to continue with the amputation.
'The surgeon decided to use a saw found in a storage area. The saw was sterilised by soaking it in some disinfectant solution.'
So that's all right, then.
Jackson Carlaw, health spokesman for what's left of the Scottish Conservatives, compared the operation to 'improvised surgery on Nelson's flagship during the Battle of Trafalgar'.
It's just a pity that B&amp;Q wasn't open, otherwise, while they were at it, as well as a Black &amp; Decker chainsaw, they could have bought the old boy a nice wooden leg.

I told you Wee Burney was lying
Former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael is facing calls to resign as an MP after admitting he was the source of a story about Nicola Sturgeon secretly telling the French Ambassador that she wanted to see Call Me Dave back in Downing Street.
Wee Burney has thrown her toys out of the pram and is accusing Carmichael of 'dirty tricks' by ordering the leak of a memo containing her remarks to a national newspaper.
Carmichael now says the leak was an 'error of judgment'. Why? It may have been a breach of protocol, but what was the big secret?
Former Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael (pictured) is facing calls to resign as an MP
I told you before the election that Sturgeon wanted the Tories back in power in Westminster, so she could advance her separatist cause.
A Cabinet Office inquiry has concluded that there was 'no reason to doubt' the accuracy of the reported conversation between the First Minister and the French Ambassador.
Yet Sturgeon spent the entire campaign telling voters that she wanted to 'lock the Tories out' of Downing Street for good. So surely Carmichael has performed a public service in revealing her true intentions.
Sturgeon lied repeatedly to the electorate and she's been caught out. If anyone should resign, she should.

It must be the most bizarre birth certificate since Trigger told Del Boy that under Father's Name, his mum had put down: 'Some soldiers.'
Elton John has upset feminist writer Germaine Greer by registering his partner David Furnish as the 'mother' of their sons, Zachary and Elijah.
The boys were born to the same surrogate mum in California and share the same anonymous egg donor.
Greer said the decision by Elton and his husband to claim that Furnish is the 'mother' undermines the very concept of motherhood.
You don't have to be a raging 'homophobe' to agree with her. Claiming a man can be a husband and a mother is complete madness, but a logical development of the 'equality' agenda.
The only thing that surprises me is, given the recent gay wedding cake case in Northern Ireland, Elton and Mummy didn't call the boys Bert and Ernie.

Let's all pray 4 Moo-Amba
If you thought the story about police scrambling a helicopter, dozens of officers, 20 patrol cars and six marksmen to shoot dead a stray cow was rip-roaring bonkers, you ain't heard nothing yet.
On Friday, around 60 locals mounted a candlelit vigil for the late cow, a Limousin heifer called Bessie, in Chicken Road, Wallsend, Northumbria.
You couldn't make it up.
Some of them were dressed in cow suits, others left sympathy cards. A further 7,000 people paid their respects on Facebook. If I'd have known, I could have knocked out a few Portashrines, left over from the Pray 4 Muamba fiasco.
This time, it was Pray 4 Moo-amba.
There's a wonderful photo on the local newspaper's website of the Cook family  mum Melanie, dad Dave and 11-year-old son Charlie, kneeling in silent tribute to Bessie in front of a candle and a model cow they'd brought along to mark the sad occasion. Another woman showed how much she cared by waving a flickering candle app on her iPhone.
Here we go mooby moo!

	Ed Snowden leaks crippled war on terror as Al Qaeda groups now use new codes

	Snowden's theft of 1.7million classified files from GCHQ and the US's National Security Agency has had a 'profound impact' on the agencies' ability to tackle jihadists.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
The 78-page report, which drew heavily on testimonies from senior security sources, found:
 At least three Al Qaeda-linked terror groups have changed their communication methods and use more effective codes since the leaks to avoid detection;
 Extremist websites began to protect their digital communications by releasing encryption programs for their followers 'within three to five months' of the disclosures;
 Jihadists have produced a video outlining what they have learned from the leaks, passing on tips on how Islamist fanatics can avoid surveillance;
 A top GCHQ spy who cracks the communications of important terror suspects said it now took him three times as long  six weeks compared with two;
 Revelations about spy techniques have 'polluted ongoing operations, due to fear of discovery'. As they can no longer be run safely, such intelligence-gathering has had to stop;
 Technology firms have created a 'severe problem' by being less willing to co-operate with security service requests for information on private communications.
The study said: 'There is a significant problem regarding governments' diminishing ability to access communications data.'
The Snowden files revealed details about covert attempts by security services, including MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, to collect citizens' private information by gathering internet histories, emails and phone records.
Snowden claims he had to act because the US and other Western governments' policies were a 'threat to democracy'
This made it easier for spies to find and track jihadists plotting to target Britain. But privacy campaigners criticised the methods.
The analysis, called Surveillance After Snowden, acknowledged such concerns, adding that intelligence agencies 'may have to open up further than they have in the past and provide greater translucency'.
But it said it is 'untrue' that the UK and US were engaged in 'mass surveillance of ordinary citizens or brazenly looking at their emails'. Report author Robin Simcox said there must be 'greater societal acceptance' of the risk that an innocent person's communications might be accidentally collected by GCHQ and the NSA as they hunt for terrorists.
He said: 'Western citizens are generally happy for the state to have an army with sophisticated weaponry because they know that it will not be misused; there is a faith that the checks and balances are sufficient to ensure public safety.
'This same principle should apply to the weaponry given to our spy agencies.'
Mr Simcox concluded: 'Ultimately, Snowden only exposed that our agencies are essentially doing what we ask: they are not spying on the phone calls of ordinary citizens or brazenly looking at our emails; they are legally intercepting certain communications in an attempt to advance the national interest.
'The state giving up these powers invites attack from terrorists, cyber-criminals or a host of other state and non-state actors.'
Snowden claims he had to act because the US and other Western governments' policies were a 'threat to democracy'.
He fled justice in the US to Hong Kong and then Russia, where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location.
CHLORINE BOMBS THREAT TO BRITAIN BY ISIS MILITANTS BACK FROM SYRIA
Bombs laced with chlorine could be detonated in Britain by Islamic State militants returning from Syria and Iraq, security experts have warned.
They said that the chemical, which is easy to buy in the UK, is the new weapon of choice for terrorists.
Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the retired head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, believes British IS terrorists will have been given chemical weapons training so they can come back to launch an attack.
He urged ministers to tighten controls on the sale of chlorine, which can be lethal when inhaled, adding: 'As more jihadists return to this country there is a growing chance (of a chlorine bomb attack).'
In the UK, anyone can buy 90 tons of chlorine without a licence. And Colonel de Bretton-Gordon told The Times that people could go to waste sites to collect chlorine found in dumped household fridges.
The warning came as it emerged British soldiers have received training for dealing with chemical weapons. In March, troops from the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, were deployed to Stanford Training Area in Norfolk to face simulated chemical attacks.
Counter-terrorism police said there was 'potential' for a chlorine bomb attack, but that the risk was no different from other terrorist methods.
 An Iraq war colonel has added to calls that the Government should do more to stop the spread of IS. Tim Collins said the UK should 'actually do something'. His comments come after former chief of the defence staff Lord Dannatt urged David Cameron to draw up plans for sending troops to fight extremists.

	It's been another bumper season for rollercoasters, writes CRAIG BROWN, with the phrase being used to describe everything from Katie Price's love life to 16th century politics.

On Twitter, too, there have been rollercoasters galore. Swimming makes me cry. Swimming makes me laugh. Swimming makes me sad. Swimming makes me happy. It takes me on a rollercoaster of emotions, tweets someone, or something, called Swimming Is Me.
Others are less specific as to what it is about their lives that makes them seem like a rollercoaster. My life is a rollercoaster, reads one tweet. Life is a rollercoaster: enjoy the moment while it lasts, reads another.
In recent years, the rollercoaster has overtaken the nightmare as the great catch-all symbol to employ whenever life goes a tiny little bit wrong.
Fearne Cotton described her last day as a DJ at Radio 1 as a 'rollercoaster chapter' of her life, while Claire Tomalin imagined the 16th cenury as a 'religious rollercoaster' through Catholicism and Protestantism
In the old days, you used to hear people say: It was a NIGHTMARE! I wanted cod and chips  but they only had haddock! But now they say: I wanted cod and chips  but they only had haddock! It was a ROLLERCOASTER!
Rollercoasters crop up in the most unlikely places, not all of them low-brow. The last place you might expect to come across a rollercoaster is in Claire Tomalins great biography of Samuel Pepys, but here it is, on page 13, when she writes about the religious rollercoaster of the previous century, when successive Tudor monarchs first overthrew the Catholic Church, set up Protestantism, restored Catholicism and then settled into uneasy compromise under Elizabeth . . .
Even the most sober, starchy commentators have started to ride on rollercoasters.
In March, after the Chancellor had delivered his last Budget before the General Election, no less a figure than the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility announced public services spending is on a rollercoaster profile through the next Parliament.
Nowadays, there is virtually nothing that cannot be compared to a rollercoaster. A fortnight after the rollercoaster Budget, the supermodel Malaika Firth talked about her rollercoaster profession to The Guardian.
Katie Price is credited as 'one of the great pioneers' of the rollercoaster, having used the term in all five of her autobiographies to describe her relationships, the pains of breaking up and falling in love
I wish I had known how much pressure there would be. Id have been able to prepare myself better. From the outside it all looks so easy, but the days can be frickin long, and sometimes you see some girls at the end of the shoot thinking: Oh my gosh, Im tired.
All in all, it is, she concluded, a frickin roller- coaster.
One of the great pioneers of the rollercoaster was the busty former glamour model Katie Price, who has fallen back on the term in all five of her autobiographies.
My marriage was over. It ended when Pete left me. The last few months had been such a rollercoaster for me, with the pain of the break-up and then falling in love with Alex, she writes in her fourth book, You Only Live Once.
Her introduction to her fifth memoir, Love, Lipstick And Lies, observes: As usual with me, the three years since my last book have been a rollercoaster ride. Theres always drama with a capital D in my life.
Small wonder that, in an open letter to her next husband, Alex was driven to write: Dear Kieran, Youre now officially on the Katie Price rollercoaster ride.
Real-life rollercoaster rides last just a few minutes and return you safe and sound to the same place from which you set out. They may leave you with a few hairs out of place, but otherwise the world remains the same.
It seems odd, then, that they are used quite so regularly to describe periods of high drama that often take place over a number of years, even decades.
Sometimes it seems that the only thing no one ever compares to a rollercoaster is a rollercoaster. But it is on a roll, and theres no stopping it.

Alana said: 'R.I.P Toby. Such a lovely lad and I'm forever in your debt for the favour you did for me. Sleep well mate.'
His family said: 'We have all greatly appreciated the outpourings of love that we have received from everyone who knew Toby.
'It's clear that he touched many people through his all too brief life.'
He suffered a cardiac arrest and was rushed to Stoke Mandeville Hospital, but he later died
Police have launched an investigation after the 17-year-old died soon after taking the illegal drug.
Detective Inspector Brendan Murray from Thames Valley Police said: 'Our thoughts are with his family and loved-ones at this extremely difficult time.
'Late on Friday night or in the early hours of Saturday morning, we believe that Toby digested a substance which he believe to be the illegal drug MDMA
'We will not speculate on what this substance was or what caused his death.
'A post-mortem examination is scheduled to be carried out next week, which will include toxicology and histology tests.
'It is likely to be several weeks before the results of these tests are known.
'I would strongly urge young people not to take or experiment with illegal drugs such as MDMA.
'They are extremely dangerous and often contain poisons and illicit chemicals which can prove fatal.
A 17-year-old boy from Buckingham has been arrested on suspicion of supplying a controlled drug.
He has been released on police bail until 29 June.

	Divorcees Alison Sharland will stand alongside Varsha Gohil at London's Supreme Court next month as they fight for bigger settlements.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Jailed: Bhadresh Gohil was convicted of money laundering and given a 10-year prison sentence
Mrs Gohil, 50, accepted 270,000 and the family Peugeot from solicitor Bhadresh Gohil, also 50, in 2004 after divorcing him for alleged adultery and unreasonable behaviour.
But she later learnt he was wealthy. In 2010 he was jailed for ten years for money laundering after a court heard he helped Nigerian politician James Ibori steal 50million from the oil-rich region he governed.
In 2012, a High Court judge ruled that Mr Gohil had failed to disclose his financial circumstances, and ordered that the divorce settlement be scrapped.
But Mr Gohil's lawyers went to the Court of Appeal, which ruled in his favour. Lord Justice McFarlane offered Mrs Gohil his sympathy but said it was 'simply not open to the court' to decide in 2012 about an issue discussed in 2004.
He also added that if Mr Gohil's fortune was ill-gotten, then she had no claim to it.
However, his wife has now won the right for the Supreme Court to be the final arbiter. Mrs Sharland is contesting her 10.3million payout because exhusband Charles deceived her about the value of his computer software business. He does not dispute he 'seriously misled' her.
Mother-of-three Mrs Sharland, 48, and her 54-year-old exhusband married in 1993 and built a substantial fortune based on his company AppSense before separating in 2010. His accountants valued his shares at 7million, while his wife's team put the value at 32million.
They compromised, and she accepted 30 per cent of the value of his shares, believing the agreement granted her half the couple's assets. But it later emerged that the company was valued at up to $1billion, making his stake worth 150million. A High Court judge said Mr Sharland's evidence had been 'seriously misleading' but concluded it did not make any difference to the divorce settlement.
The Court of Appeal also ruled he had been dishonest but did not say Mrs Sharland should get more.
She now hopes the Supreme Court takes a different view when the hearing, which will consider both cases, starts on June 8.

	Evolutionary biologist Professor David Bainbridge argues that men are attracted to women with brains because a high intellect suggests she will be a responsible mother.

So I'm not convinced by Professor Bainbridge's findings. It might just be that his results are a bit skewed, as most men are going to say that they like clever women because, of course, any woman who chooses them must be fiendishly intelligent.
In any case, where's the challenge in attracting a stupid woman?
But very few of them want to feel that they are out of their league brains-wise.
As for my husband, while he says it was my brains and looks he was attracted to, as far as he is concerned it's a fine line between clever and too clever by half.
I think women find it sexy if a man is way smarter than they are, but a man will always want to prove that he's the really intelligent one.
After 27 years of marriage, what always cheers my husband up are the things I can't do.
For example, while he knows that on the general knowledge front I am always going to beat him, he never tires of pointing out: 'If you were really clever, you wouldn't have failed your driving test 13 times.'

The secret is out! Men do not like their women being dim. You needn't be a red-hot intellectual, but it helps to be quick-witted and able to listen to an argument. In a big, cruel, uncertain world the last thing a bloke needs is to be shackled to a demanding fool, however beautiful.
That men go for brains, rather than more obvious physical attributes, is a theory I've long subscribed to.
As a student I inherited a boyfriend from an airily lovely and wholly irrational girl who, he told me later, believed every word in her horoscope every week in every magazine, even when they contradicted each other.
He knew it probably had to end when she burst into tears at how it was 'sooo unfair' when her bank account was overdrawn.
I think he took to me because we met at a lecture on Dr Johnson and chatted about the use of dictionaries. It didn't last, but only because he went off with an elegant physicist who had better clothes.
So I can't be surprised by the report. Yes, there is a temporary buzz for a man in being admired by a daffy gorgeous airhead, but when it wears off he's left with the embarrassment and torment of having to go around with someone wilfully dim, prey to every barmy fashionable idea and probably addicted to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop website.
Beauty is all very well, but you can't be rolling around in bed all the time. Courtship is about company as well as sex. So unless they're self-absorbed psychopaths who never listen anyway, most bright men do like women to be capable of conversation, able to listen to a new idea, think it over and offer one back. Even if the discussion is just about whether to go out or watch TV.
In my dating days, I managed to look middling-presentable, but it was pretty obvious that the men who stuck around were the ones who enjoyed a chat and a joke as well as a cuddle, and didn't mind an argument if it was good-natured.
I don't think I ever lost a boyfriend to a rival who wasn't as clever as me. And when it comes to serious stuff like marriage, men aren't stupid; who'd want to be lumbered with an idiot who doesn't have a taste for earning her own living?
It's all there in Jane Austen's Pride And Prejudice. Lizzie gets Darcy because she's bright and confident as well as having 'fine eyes'.
Her poor father Mr Bennet is stuck with Mrs Bennet because early in life, 'Captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, he married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her'. Harsh, but true.

As someone with very little bust to speak of, I'd love to believe Professor David Bainbridge when he says it's the size of our brains, not our breasts, that matters more to men. Experience, however, teaches me otherwise. I know several women in high-powered jobs who are still single. They are all attractive, solvent and witty. But they're also very clever  and what they all say is that men find them scary.
Most men, of course, are clever enough to know that they'd be accused of being at best unenlightened and at worst downright misogynistic if they admitted to preferring a well-endowed bust to a well-stocked brain.
But they're usually not clever enough to disguise their fear when it becomes clear that a woman might be more knowledgeable than them or  worse  disagree with them. On a primitive, atavistic level they can't help but feel that their masculinity is threatened.
With another man they can confront the issue in one of two ways: by being aggressive, or by submitting. But with a woman? Submission's not an option  and they know aggression shouldn't be either.
So instead they end up in a defensive, patronising flap  which, needless to say, is not conducive to love and romance.
According to Professor Bainbridge, men value intelligence in a potential mate more highly than large breasts or long legs because they think a clever woman makes a better mother.
Even if this were true (there are plenty of brilliant women who are lousy mothers) it's impossible to measure. What clever women know is that what men really value is a woman who makes them feel good. And the way to do that is use your intelligence, well, cleverly.
For example: when they're holding forth on something you know a lot about, don't tell them that you've got a PhD in the subject.
Just look at them intently instead, while saying 'really?' in breathy tones of stunned admiration.
Or, if they're about to do something really stupid that will almost certainly jeopardise their career, don't tell them scathingly that what they're proposing is a sure route to demotion or the sack.
Instead just say, slightly hesitantly, 'of course, I know very little about this', and then follow up with: 'you've probably thought about this already, but what about doing X?'
Because a truly clever woman knows that the best way to attract a husband is to make your idea their idea. In short, be clever enough to disguise your cleverness.
Oh yes  and despite what Professor Bainbridge says, it won't hurt to wear a Wonderbra, too.

It's not my mind men swoon over
Biographer and literary critic Frances Wilson has an English degree from St Hugh's College, Oxford, and PhD from Sussex University.
Like many women, Marilyn Monroe included, I am sapiosexual  which means I am sexually attracted to intelligence.
My first crush was on the monocled Patrick Moore, then presenting The Sky At Night; at school I fancied the physics geeks, at university I went for the men who never left the manuscripts library.
I have no interest in what a man looks like, how much hair he has, how tall he is or how firm his six-pack, just as long as he keeps me satisfied in the intellectual department.
In fact, the more eccentric and bedraggled, the more authentic I believe his brainpower to be.
I still melt when my first husband talks computer science to me; when my current partner quotes from the minor Caroline poets I need to fan myself down.
So when Professor Bainbridge reveals 'The main thing men are looking for is intelligence' I should be cheering that the male of the species has evolved to the point where he can look longingly into a woman's spectacles without being distracted by whether or not her bust is, as the professor puts it, 'symmetrical'.
Except . . . I have yet to meet a true male sapiosexual, a man who genuinely swoons with desire when a woman entertains him over supper with an analysis of German metaphysics.
I am better endowed in the brain than the boob departments, but it doesn't take much to grasp that the big-brained men I have stepped out with care little for my skill at Anglo-Saxon verb inflections.
No man has ever salivated over my enthusiasm for the criticism of I. A. Richards unless I happened to be sporting a well-fitting Lycra top as I spoke.
Women learn from birth that it is bazookas rather than brain-power alone that will open doors for us. This is the result of my own research: men like women to be mirrors who reflect them to twice their natural intellectual size.

Sex really isn't rocket science
Magazine editor and writer Lindsay Nicholson has an astrophysics degree from University College London.
As someone who studied astrophysics at university, I have to say that I never felt besieged by the nine out of ten students on my course who were men. But nor, I suspect, did any of my fellow female rocket scientists  some of whom probably also had bigger breasts than me.
Certainly no man ever gazed deep into my eyes and asked me to explain Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle to him, which I certainly could have done.
On the other hand I can't recall ever being turned down for a date by someone who feared I could calculate differential equations faster than he could  even though that would almost certainly have also been true. In fact, I have to say my brains have never really been an issue one way or the other. So I was slightly baffled by Professor Bainbridge's research, not least because as a scientist I really doubt that the basis of sexual attraction is something that can be measured in any meaningful sense.
The idea that men are drawn to women who look brainy enough to raise their children seems in itself wildly unscientific, as well as disregarding the effects of thousands of years of civilisation.
Raising children, while exhausting, demanding and deeply rewarding doesn't require the sort of brainpower required to dash off a fiendish sudoku in five minutes flat. And thank heavens for that. I think we only have to look around us to see that attraction is varied and complex.
As the mother of a 22-year-old daughter  both pretty and brainy in my view  I have spent years discouraging the idea that the prettier you are the more successful you will be in love (Princess Diana being a case in point).
But I don't think simply being brainy will help much, either.
I believe people get, and stay, together for a multitude of reasons, which are as impossible to calculate as the likelihood of a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil causing a tornado in Texas  which is Chaos Theory, by the way.
Mind you, as my daughter sits her university finals this month 'brains win you boys' could be an argument to get her through those last few days of revision.
And for that reason only, I might just concede that the professor has a point.

Men simply hate being outwitted

Whenever I get chatted up by a man, one line always strikes terror into my heart: 'I like clever women.' Why?
Because in my experience men who say they want an intelligent, high-achieving woman are the most difficult men with whom to have a relationship.
This is because they are in love with an idea  a very commendable idea  but not the reality.
One ex-boyfriend of mine, a City broker, was always insisting to me in the early days of our courtship what a turn-on it was that I was 'incredibly bright'. He was also happy, he said, that I had a career and identity of my own.
A few years in, he was yelling at me to do what he wanted in every single situation, right down to what I wore.
He once made me line up my shoes in the way he wanted.
Perhaps a part of the attraction for him was that in conquering a clever woman he felt like he'd secured even more of a triumph.
Maybe that's what these men in the research survey are all about. But the reality of being constantly challenged by a woman whose brain is working overtime is not something they warm to in the long term, believe me.
I have a theory that most men make an immediate assessment when they meet a woman of whether she's the type he'd like to sleep with  and if she is, then they are far more receptive to what she says and thinks.
But a surface fascination with the 'brains' rather than the 'bust' part of the equation can evaporate pretty quickly when the woman challenges his right to dominate.
This is a tough truth for us girls, but it's far better for women to understand that men work this way. And it is better for men to be honest and admit they like pretty women who don't challenge them too much, because then it saves those of us who don't fit that bill a lot of time and effort.
Knowing what I do now, at the grand age of 43 I've taken a break from the dating scene.
If I was in it, I'd try to find men who are much more intelligent and successful than me.
A betrayal of my feminist principles? Perhaps  but it would cut out a lot of silly game-playing that only ends in tears.

	Shaker Aamer, pictured with two of his children, is still being held at Guantanamo Bay without trial after 13 years despite US president Barack Obama promising to 'prioritise' his release.

Some have expressed puzzlement over why this paper has campaigned doggedly for the return to Britain of Shaker Aamer, detained for 13 years in Guantanamo Bay without trial.
They point out, rightly, that he is being held for his suspected involvement in Islamist terrorism and may be a highly dangerous man.
Furthermore, Saudi-born Aamer is not even a British citizen (though his wife and children are, his family home is in London and he has rights of residency in the UK).
To such critics, the Mail has a simple answer. Since Magna Carta, whose 800th anniversary we celebrate next month, this country has held it a fundamental principle of civilisation that no one should be imprisoned without due process.
'A slap in the face': Shaker Aamer, pictured with two of his children, is still being held at Guantanamo Bay after 13 years despite US president Barack Obama promising to 'prioritise' his release
It is this, above all, that sets us apart from our barbarian enemies, protecting every one of us from arbitrary injustice. This is why it grieves us so deeply that our American cousins have so shockingly betrayed the rule of law.
Indeed, more than six years after Barack Obama came to power, swearing to shut down Guantanamo Bay, the camp remains in business as a shaming stain on the Wests good name and a recruiting sergeant for terrorism.
Meanwhile, five months after the president assured David Cameron he would prioritise Aamers release, a cross-party delegation of MPs finds little sign that he means to keep his word.
The Prime Minister must hold him to it. For until Aamer is brought back to these shores, to be reunited with his family or face his day in court, it will be impossible to disagree with former Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell when he calls it a slap in the face for Americas staunchest friend.
Isnt Aamers continuing detention also an insult to every principle the US claims to hold dear?

Whats the hurry?
AS Mr Cameron prepares for a whirlwind tour of Europe to set out Britains terms for remaining in the EU, the Mail has a question: why the tearing rush?
Yes, its easy to understand his wish to get the matter settled sooner rather than later, so that he doesnt have to bang on about Europe, as he puts it, for the next two and a half years.
But with so much at stake, is it really wise to bring the referendum forward to next year  possibly as early as May (obstructive, unelected opposition peers permitting), as he appears to intend?
Consider. Any truly significant repatriation of powers from Brussels will mean treaty changes, requiring the agreement of all 27 of our partners. It is surely unrealistic to expect these to be settled in only a few months.

	In an interview with Stephen Fry, it is revealed Ive has been promoted to Apple's first Chief Design Officer.

'Jony is one of the most talented and accomplished designers of his generation, with an astonishing 5000 design and utility patents to his name.
'His new role is a reflection of the scope of work he has been doing at Apple for some time. Jonys design responsibilities have expanded from hardware and, more recently, software UI to the look and feel of Apple retail stores, our new campus in Cupertino, product packaging and many other parts of our company.'
Apple's spaceship campus - where it has been revealed Sir Jonathan Ive even had a hand in designing the chair and desks.
'On July 1, he will hand off his day-to-day managerial responsibilities of ID and UI to Richard Howarth, our new vice president of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye, our new vice president of User Interface Design.'
During an interview with Architectural Record , chief architect Sir Norman Foster recently gave an additional insight into how Apple's 'spaceship' will be built - as well as the inspiration behind its circular and 'organic' design.
This includes cars being 'banished and buried' in underground car parks, tarmac being replaced by greenery and windows that stretch the full height of the four-storey main building that slide open.
He also revealed that there will be room for 1,000 bikes and the tricks he is using to make the giant campus seem compact.
'It's interesting how it evolved,' explained Sir Foster. 'First of all, there was a smaller site.
Appearing as a giant saucer, theSilicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple employees.
TheSpaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and centralcourtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 squarefeet of 'research' space.
'Then, as the project developed, and the Hewlett-Packard site became available, the scale of the project changed.
'The reference point for Steve [Jobs] was always the large space on the Stanford campus - the Main Quad - which Steve knew intimately.
'He would reminisce about the time when he was young, and California was still the fruit bowl of the United States.
'It was still orchards.'
KEY FEATURES OF APPLE'S SPACESHIP-LIKE CAMPUS 2
Appearing as a giant saucer, the  Silicon Valley site near the 280 Highway will be home to 13,000 Apple  employees.
There will be jogging and cycling trails, with  more than a thousand bikes kept on site at all times, which staff can  use to make their way around.
The  Spaceship will have 360-degree curved glass fronted walls and central  courtyard as well as a 1,000-seater auditorium, a gym and 300,000 square  feet of 'research' space.
Apple Campus 2 will additionally have  underground parking hidden from view, meaning 80 per cent of the site  can be covered in trees. The site was previously owned by Hewlett Packard and the majority of the area is currently covered in asphalt.

Elsewhere  underground, the auditorium will be where Apple's CEO Tim Cook will  present the companies keynotes ahead of product launches, for example.  This auditorium will be covered with a circular glass pavilion that will  also be an access point for employees and guests.
Natural gas will, primarily, provide  the building's power and the local energy grid will only be accessed in  emergencies. The glass structure will also be fitted with solar panels.
The circular, four-storey building will be around a mile in circumference and a third of a mile wide and was recently described by the San Fransisco Weekly as a massive glass doughnut.
The  building stays eco-friendly with natural ventilation that works instead  of air-conditioning for 70 per cent of the year, low energy LED  lighting where natural light doesnt reach, and on-site recycling.
Although the majority of his work is at Apple, Sir Jonathan has taken part is other projects - and is believed to have been behind the design of Eve, the female robot in the hit film wall-e
In 2001, he created a white polystyrene box to house a book by Paul Smith, and in 2013  worked with Marc Newson, who also helped design the Apple Watch, on a range of products for the Project Red auction - where an aluminium desk the pair worked on sold for $1.7 million.
In a rare interview, Sir Jonathan revealed to the New Yorker he has also helped shape the far future in a conversation with Star Wars director and friend J. J. Abrams.
Ive once sat next to J. J. Abrams at a boozy dinner party in New York, and made what Abrams recalled as 'very specific' suggestions about the design of lightsabres, it claims.
'It was just a conversation,' Ive told the magazine.
Although he'd said nothing about cross guards, he had made a case for unevenness
'I thought it would be interesting if it were less precise, and just a little bit more spitty
A redesigned weapon could be 'more analog and more primitive, and I think, in that way, somehow more ominous.'
The result of an ambitious $4.05 billion buyout that saw Disney acquire complete autonomy over the franchise from LucasFilm in November 2012, the hugely popular first trailer revealed a new weapon - a fiery new lightsabre, with a cross guard, and a resemblance to a burning crucifix.
The explosive trailer for 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'
In the interview, Ive also reveals the firm's secret office on Apple's Cupertino capmpus.
'The room is about three thousand square feet, though its outsized reputation has led it to be described as 'cavernous;
It ends in a glass wall, behind which stand three eight-foot-high computer-numerical-control (C.N.C.) milling machines that shape plastic and metal to produce models and prototype parts.
Ive's small team of designers work 12 hour days, and when Ive designed the space he wanted these machines to be as integrated into the studio as noise and dust pollution allowed.
'They make physical objects, and that is what we're doing,' he told his interviewer.
JONY IVE ON WORKING WITH STEVE JOBS
'Steve was the most focused person I've met in my life.
'It's terrifying that when you really truly focus, it seems a bit illegal.
'You can achieve so much.
'What focus means is saying no with every bone in your body to something you know is a good idea but you say no because you're focused on something else.
I remember talking to Steve Jobs and asked why he was perceived as harsh.
'And I said couldn't we be more moderate? And he said why? And I said because I care about the team.
'And he said: 'No Jony, you're just really vain. You just want people to like you. I'm surprised at you, because I thought you really held the work up as the most important and not how you are perceived by people.''
'People misunderstand Steve because he was so focused'
Toward the end of his life, Jobs told Walter Isaacson, 'If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it's Jony. Jony and I think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say, 'Hey, what do you think about this?'
'He gets the big picture as well as the most infinitesimal details about each product.
'And he understands that Apple is a product company.
'He's not just a designer. That's why he works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me.'
Ive is also believed to have been the designer of Eve (left) from the Pixar hit film Wall-E
Ive's small team of designers work 12 hour days
Ive also spoke at a special celebration of Jobs life, held on the lawn at Infinite Loop, Apple's office.
'Steve used to say to meand he used to say this a lot'Hey, Jony, here's a dopey idea.'
'And sometimes they were: really dopey. Sometimes they were truly dreadful. But sometimes they took the air from the room, and they left us both completely silent.
'Bold, crazy, magnificent ideas. Or quiet, simple ones which, in their subtlety, their detail, they were utterly profound.' Ive said to me, 'I couldn't be more mindful of him.
'How could I not, given our personal relationship, and given that I'm still designing in the same place, at the same table, where I spent the last fifteen years with him sat next to me?'
The Apple Watch was conceived 'close to Steve's death,' Ive said.

The address was one of a number visited during last Tuesday's police operation.
Families for Survival UK is alleged to be one of at least five organisations which provided fraudsters with fake employment details.
Two directors of other companies, including a recruitment firm, were also arrested. A number of the companies are alleged not to be trading.

Under Government rules, EU nationals are only allowed to claim housing benefit in Britain if they can prove they work here.
MIGRANTS USED TO SPILL OUT ONTO STREET OF LONDON FLAT
So many migrants used a small East London flat to milk housing benefits that they had to spill out onto the street, neighbours claim.
The tiny apartment in Bow is above an Italian restaurant and was allegedly used by migrants over a three-year period.
Today one worker at a courier service East End Logistics based next door described how the flat saw a huge turnover of different people coming and going over the years.
The man, who did not wish to be named, said: We have been seeing quite a few people there in the last year or so - people walking in and out.
'Every day people were coming and going. The people couldnt all fit in the flat so they would have to gather outside. At the time we thought they might have opened a job or recruitment centre there.
It was mainly people of 20 years old and upwards to about 50, people from different backgrounds.'
He added: One obstacle for us is all of the people gathering outside of our door and making it uncomfortable for our customers.
We were always wondering what they were doing until we read the newspapers and saw the police come around.'
Redbridge Council, which has worked alongside the DWP and the Metropolitan Polices financial investigation unit, is the first council whose probe into the fraud has led to arrests.
The authoritys housing benefits investigation team was first alerted to the alleged fraud last summer after a large number of benefit applications were received from Italian nationals of Bangladesh origin, all claiming they earned around 156 a week.
According to the charity's annual report, it was last year chosen by Sainsburys as a support charity and declared income of 316,000 in grants and donations.
Nobody from Families for Survival UK was available for comment.
Two of those arrested, Khanam and 35-year-old KM Habibur Rahman, a former director of a company called Crystal Job Limited, were charged with conspiracy to defraud.
They appeared at Redbridge Magistrates Court last Wednesday. Both were released on conditional bail.
Eight other suspects arrested are alleged to have made fake housing benefit claims and have been charged with offences under Section 2 of the Fraud Act.
They are due to appear in court this week. Other migrants alleged to be involved in the scam are expected to be questioned over the coming weeks.
Councillor Kam Rai, Redbridge Councils cabinet member for finance and resources, said: This fraud was detected late last year.
Since then our own benefit fraud team has been painstakingly investigating to collect the evidence and this success is a direct result of their very hard work.

When people commit fraud against the council, they steal from you, your friends, family and the community. Fraud takes money away from vital services and impacts on us all.
We are determined to crack down on people who abuse the system

A council spokesman said it expects thousands of pounds in housing benefit will be saved each week thanks to the investigation.
A DWP spokesman told MailOnline this morning: Our fraud investigators have powers to track benefit cheats around the world and bring them before the courts.
We are determined to crack down on people who abuse the system, so that benefits only go to those who really need this help.
In addition to any sentence imposed by the courts, fraudsters must pay back all the money they falsely obtained and face a criminal record for life.

	Natasha Bolter, 39, claims Ukip's head of candidates David Soutter embarked on a relationship with her, after investigating a formal complaint she made concerning the party's then general secretary.

After a picture of the tryst was published on Saturday in the Mail, Ukip insisted that it had just been a one off.
But now a selfie of the couple cuddled up in the back of a taxi during a liaison the week before has emerged.
A friend of Mrs Bolter also leaked a series of racy text messages that appeared to show the pair flirting.

Mrs Bolter, who is divorced, said she had been in a relationship with Mr Soutter but insisted she had not known he was married.
In a statement, she said: We were in a relationship. He was assisting me with allegations of racism, bullying and sexism.
He abused a position of trust and power. I was unaware he was married. I have no further comment to add at this time.
Last night the Mail was presented with evidence that challenged Ukips claim that their meeting at the hotel bar last Tuesday, May 19, was a one off.
A photograph, taken shortly before 8pm on May 13, showed Mrs Bolter with her head on Mr Soutters shoulder in the back of a taxi.
A friend of Mrs Bolter also provided a text message conversation from earlier this year in which Mr Soutter allegedly asked her to meet him with no underwear on.
He appeared to write: Dare you to come commando !!! After she refused, it is claimed he added: Dont be boring.
In a further conversation, Mrs Bolter sent a picture of a relationship advice book called After the affair, which on its cover says: How to build trust and love again. Mr Soutter allegedly replied with: I want to keep you.
The claims are hugely embarrassing for Mr Soutter who is responsible for trying to prevent damaging scandals involving Ukip candidates. Ukip refused to comment on whether he would be suspended or face an investigation.
Mrs Bolter, who left Ukip after claiming it was riddled with racism, misogyny and sexual harassment, was questioned by Mr Soutter about her complaint against Mr Bird at the start of November before it was decided to bring in independent investigators. Mr Bird was cleared of wrongdoing but stood down as general secretary in December.
A party figure called on Mr Soutter to stand down. He said: It now appears Soutter had a hidden agenda encouraging her to complain. He should quit.
Mr Soutter, who has been married to his second wife Elizabeth, 49, for 24 years, declined to comment. He and Mrs Bolter were pictured last Tuesday evening leaving a hotel on Grosvenor Square. They had been seen in the bar together with Mrs Bolter putting her arm around him.
At one point, Mr Soutter left her before returning to say: Theyre fully booked. They enjoyed a quick kiss on the lips shortly before leaving together with Mr Soutter carrying a small cabin bag-style suitcase.
