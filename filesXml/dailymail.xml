	a British entrepreneur has taken the idea and turned it into reality, creating a powdered foodstuff billed as ‘nutritionally complete’, made from oat flour, pea and rice protein, flaxseed and various vitamins.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
And Hearn and Neo are not its only fans  as Dr Frankie Phillips of the British Dietetic Association gave it a qualified thumbs-up.
It provides all the vitamins, minerals and nutrition the body needs, and enough fluid as well. It does what it says on the tin, she said. Although, if someone was eating this for years, its questionable what might happen to their physiology.
So, can Man really live on powdered food alone and get his recommended 2,500 calories a day? To find out, I attempted to consume nothing but the product for a day and believe me it was 24 hours of Huel.
Grim grub: Neo wakes up to the real world in The Matrix and discovers all there is to eat is a nutritious gloop
THEY CALL IT THE 'HUEL' BUT DRINK LOOKS LIKE KEANU'S 'GLOOP' TO US
All that Keanu Reeves as Neo and PVC-clad fellow rebel Trinity have to eat in The Matrix, the 1999 film about humanity enslaved by a machine, is a gruel-like gloop. Its a single-cell protein combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins and minerals. Everything the body needs, explains Neos pal  and thats the slogan printed on Huels packaging. Sure enough, Neo battles through a trilogy of Matrix movies, so maybe there is something in the Huel fuel diet after all
BREAKFAST
My first meal of the day normally consists of fruit salad (for vitamins), yoghurt (calcium), cereal (fibre), eggs (amino acids) and toast (carbohydrates). Sometimes theres a frankfurter or two (protein, fat), and hot chocolate (sugar!) too.
My wife Rocio and I insist our two children know the value of a varied breakfast and leave for school with a full tank. So I get a quizzical look when I open the anti-moisture, zip-lock, foil-wrapped Huel pack, and am asked: Is this is a good idea?
It is a perfectly balanced blend of all the macro and micro nutrients that your body needs to function effectively, I parrot. Its got everything in that your breakfasts got.
I peer into the packet and take a sniff of my next three meals.
Slim physique:Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in the 1999 movie
Huel is flavoured with a hint of vanilla but has the aroma of no other foodstuff I have ever encountered. Its not unpleasant, but it is a little odd. I measure out 500ml of water into the Huel jug which has inside it a special plastic grate designed to break up the powder properly when it is mixed. I drink out of the near-inch wide spout. The consistency is that of runny pancake mixture and Im not sure if I am drinking or eating. It is strangely sweet, surprisingly so given theres no added sugar. This isnt so bad, I think.
Then I feel lumps of unmixed goo in my mouth, so I give my Huel another shake. And I shake it some more. And more. The lumps are still there. Its best mixed in a blender, Hearn told me. Very true. Having downed almost a pint of Huel  500 calories  I go to work.
ELEVENSES
On any given day, reaching 11am is reason enough to celebrate with a cup of tea and  more importantly  a chocolate biscuit or four.
Im usually ravenous, but today I dont feel hungry. Nevertheless, I dutifully break out the Huel. But its sips this time, not gulps.
LUNCH
HUEL is, deliberately, not the tastiest meal. Hearn explained that he didnt want to make it too flavoursome for fear of unleashing another addictive food product on to an increasingly obese planet where once you pop, you just cant stop. Theres no danger of that here.
So, knowing people like variety, he gave me several test flavours that I can shake up with my Huel: chocolate, rhubarb and custard, toffee and mocha. He recommended the rhubarb and custard, so I try it.
The pink powder looks and smells reminiscent of something youd find in a 10p sweetshop mix, but the hue of the Huel remains stubbornly beige. It livens up the flavour, but does nothing to improve the consistency. I get through about a cups worth, half my ration.
AFTERNOON SNACK
My enthusiasm is waning. Whats that? asks a colleague. The future of food, I reply, reading off the label again. It looks like nuclear bunker food, he retorts. I cycle home, hunger beginning to hollow.
Shot in the arm:Hearn, pictured, and Neo are not its only fans  as Dr Frankie Phillips of the British Dietetic Association gave it a qualified thumbs-up
Is this the future of dieting? British inventor creates 'human...
DINNER
Theres a jacket potato with tuna mayo and salad if I want it, but I manfully refuse and stick it out on Huel and Huel alone. Well, almost.
Hearn has given me a recipe for Huel cookies: 150g of the powder, a mashed banana, an egg, a teaspoon of butter and a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda.
By now, I just want to avoid more glugging. I miss texture, crispness, crunchiness, saltiness, tanginess, acidity  anything and everything that makes food truly food.
There might be people who are happy to have the same thing for every meal, but Im not one of them.
I make up the cookie mix, bunging in much more butter than I should and a little sugar for good measure.
Incredibly, they come out of the oven looking edible. Magically, they are edible  and taste like real food. But cleaning up the cake tin afterwards, I cant help thinking making them rather defeats the object of the exercise.
Never mind. I go to sleep, and dream of feasting on fillet steak. Its not real food, but that doesnt matter one bit.

	The events of Friday proved what many of us had feared for so long. We face one of the biggest threats to our way of life and our civilisation that we have ever seen, writes NIGEL FARAGE.

A second problem we face is that if Italy cannot get other countries to accept large numbers of migrants, then they have a simple way out. All they have to do is issue an EU passport to migrants and then anyone can come to the UK legally under EU rules.
I firmly believe the EU should follow the example of Australia which, in 2008, made it clear that migrants arriving by boats would not make Australia their home.
The boats stopped coming. The drownings stopped too.
This issue is far more serious than the usual debate about pressure on public services. This is now one of security.
Threat: A boy holds a Tunisian flag as he stands near bouquets of flowers laid at the beachside of the Imperiale Marhabada hotel. Farage said it was time to 'defend our borders'
Security: Police officers detain a migrant during a clash between migrants and a truck driver next of the ferry boat port of Calais, as Farage warned people getting into UK illegally represent security threat
Dramatic moment migrant climbs into lorry cabin
I would pay tribute to our security services. We know over 300 jihadis who have fought for Islamic State abroad are already back in the UK. Around two dozen of those have planned attacks since returning, but have been thwarted.
I suspect one of the reasons we havent had another atrocity on British soil is because our security services have done such a good job.
We must ensure our security services are given the tools they need to keep us safe. But the threat comes from beyond our shores too.
Britain must bear some culpability for destabilisation abroad. It was our government who foolishly bombed Libya into oblivion. It was a terrible mistake.
Where do the people start their journeys across the Med from now? Libya, a country with a growing IS element. IS have already said that they intend to flood the continent with 500,000 jihadi fighters. Even if that only amounts to 5,000, it is still an alarming prospect.
The Greeks and Italian authorities have absolutely no means of screening the individuals who arrive via boat for links with terrorism and extremism.
When I make the argument we must get tough on border controls to ensure the safety of British citizens, I am told Im not being compassionate. We must not let our compassion imperil our civilisation.
I believe we are making one of the greatest mistakes in our history.

	Home-grown terror is at the top of David Cameron's agenda by JAMES FORSYTH

	JAMES FORSYTH writes David Cameron is 'inclined to be more robust than ever' about the need to tackle the ideology that underpins terrible terrorist attacks, laying out that British Muslims have.

One of his closest political allies tells me that Cameron is inclined to be more robust than ever.
I am told that the main message of the speech will be that, It has to be recognised that there is an ideology that underpins these despicable terrorist attacks.
This has to be confronted in all its forms, Cameron will argue. You have to tackle the anti-Western rhetoric that makes people think Islamic State is the future, one of those involved in the discussions with the PM tells me.
Cameron was planning his speech even before the horrific Tunisian beach massacre that killed 15 Britons
The speech will also address the vexed issue of identity: why some Muslims dont feel part of Britain. One senior Number 10 figure says: We need to have a discussion as a country about why schoolgirls head off and join Islamic State.
Cameron will, Im informed, set out the responsibilities that both government agencies and British Muslims have.
In Whitehall, there is particular concern that the beheading in France  apparently carried out by one man  might presage a series of lone-wolf terrorist strikes across Europe. These are almost impossible to stop as they dont involve any co-ordination with outside groups.
Indeed, one senior intelligence source tells me that he is more concerned about bedroom radicalisation  people who have been drawn to IS ideology after watching videos on the internet  than he is about those returning from fighting in Syria.
Why? Because those who have been radicalised at home are clean skins and are not on the spooks radar.
I understand that the security services have disrupted at least four sizable terror plots aimed at London in the past 18 months. They are braced for the inevitable: that an attack  especially upon the capital  is bound to succeed at some point.
After all, the terrorists need to get lucky only once.
At Thames House, the headquarters of MI5, they are particularly concerned about Britons who have joined the ranks of Islamic State in Syria and stayed out there.
Their worry is that as these people are promoted up the IS hierarchy, they will turn their attention to ordering attacks on Britain  the target they know best.
PM'S SECRET LINK TO THE BANANA DJ
Ex-No 10 speechwriter Clare Foges and her new book, The Kitchen Disco about fruit that comes to life
Whats the similarity between David Camerons Bloomberg speech setting out his European strategy and The Kitchen Disco? Theyre both written by the same person.
The childrens book is the first by Camerons former speechwriter Clare Foges. Written while she was working in Number 10, its a poem about what happens when a family goes to bed and the fruit in the bowl come out to party.
Thankfully for Cameron and Foges, her poetry and political prose never got mixed up. At least, there is no record that I can find of a prime ministerial speech featuring a banana who DJs after dark.

Where will the new runway be built, Gatwick or Heathrow? On Wednesday, the Airports Commission, set up in 2012 by the Coalition, will finally make its recommendation.
The Government will respond by saying that it will review the findings and make its own decision by the end of the year.
The signs point to Gatwick as the preferred political choice. Tory MPs opposed to that option regard it as significant that Cameron recently asked one of those whose seat would be hit hardest by a second runway, how strongly he really felt about the issue.
The Airports Commission will make its recommendation on whether Gatwick or Heathrow should get a new runway on Wednesday, while the government will respond and makes its own decision by the end of the year
One close Cameron ally tells me the party leadership wouldnt be so keen on Zac Goldsmith, a fervent opponent of a third runway at Heathrow, running for Mayor of London if they were planning to build it there. Also counting against Heathrow is the fact that, early in his leadership, Cameron campaigned passionately against a third runway.
George Osborne has been seen as Heathrows big backer. But I understand that he is now most concerned about getting another runway built quickly, and that might be easier if it is at Gatwick.

The decision by Greek PM Alexis Tsipras to call a referendum on the latest bailout deal has riled other eurozone states, who say it further confuses an already tortuously complicated situation.
Even those in the UK Government who thought that if Greece defaulted it would stay within the single currency, now think it may well end up leaving the Euro altogether.
Cameron faces a difficult Commons appearance on Monday. Eurosceptic Tories are deeply disappointed by the renegotiation aims he laid out at the European Summit. Hes giving up before hes even started, fumes one. Even those involved in maintaining Tory discipline admit they are expecting a few fireworks.
Cameron, however, is bullish. He believes he has made far more progress than expected. He is now fond of saying: I keep being told I cant do things, and I keep doing them.
But if Greece does end up leaving the euro after Sundays poll, everything changes, and Cameron should start his renegotiation over, because a lot more might be on offer.

	A female teacher 'seducing' a boy isn't just a laugh says RACHEL JOHNSON

	The trial of former headmistress Anne Lakey  made me see how blinkered my attitude that only men pose a sexual threat to children was blinkered, by RACHEL JOHNSON.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
This is because we are also conditioned to see the mature woman as the nurturer. We have something called mother expectation: a child left alone with a woman will be safe, but one left alone with a man might be at risk.
(Even though if you interpret the NCA research another way, 97 per cent of men have not the faintest desire to harm children in any way.) But the notion that a woman alone and of her own accord can abuse a child messes with the myth of male power and the patriarchy, and therefore some feminists  for whom everything is the fault of nasty horrid men  dont like it.
Even known female sex offenders  Rose West or Myra Hindley  are assumed to have been to some extent acting out the desires of a dominant male, like Fred West (who some say was abused by his own mother Daisy from the age of 12) or Ian Brady. Michelle Elliott, founder of Kidscape, says that a rare conference on female sexual offenders she attended was disrupted by angry feminazis, who shouted down participants who dared discuss the topic on stage.
But after Lakey, we simply cant escape the knowledge that a female child abuser is drawn to schools, to teaching, to childcare, just as male child abusers are, and just as an alcoholic cant stay away from pubs and clubs. Like Anne Lakey, they can often operate undercover, undetected, confident that either neo-Victorian feminists dont believe women can be child-sex predators, or that people secretly agree with Greer, who once said a boys erection implies consent. (Im a fan of Greer, but this statement is tantamount to saying that a girl who involuntarily orgasms during rape enjoys it.)
The judges sentencing of Lakey to eight years jail is exemplary for good reason.
Whether the wimmin of Britain like it or not, whats sauce for the gander must also be sauce for the goose.
A hint of 'mum tum' might make you smile too, Amal
After I had my daughter I was still wearing tents from what was then Evans Outsize nine months later.
People would ask when the baby was due. Zara Tindall doesnt appear to care about her mum tum, either  certainly not enough to invest in a pair of Spanx, anyway.
Its far more reassuring to see a beautiful woman waxing than waning away, like Amal Clooney, who turned up at Westminster with withers skinnier than an Ascot thoroughbred.
And if it turns out Zara does have a bun in the oven after all, jollier still.

Killed by too much kindness
Carl Thompson, Britains fattest man, is dead
Carl Thompson, Britains fattest man, is dead. He ate 10,000 calories a day, dining on Chinese food, curries, and pizzas that he ordered online.
Immobile, he lived off disability allowance and had NHS carers who did his lunches.
His carers sound like lovely people and were clearly very fond of him. But as I listened to one reminisce on the radio about his favourite lunch of sausage, beans and chips, I couldnt help thinking that the State did not help Carl. In fact it was his  in therapy-speak  enabler.
He knew, and said, he had to lose 45 stone or he would die. He knew and said what he needed was a dietitian and shrink. Instead he was provided with a series of suppliers.
Im not saying his death was state-sponsored euthanasia, but it comes pretty close.

Gym weights aren't the real enemy
The sheriffs of California have taken on face value the ironic hip-hop lyric that says: Guns dont kill people, rappers do.
They charged Diddy (aka rapper Sean Combs) with three counts of assault with a deadly weapon after he grabbed a kettlebell gym weight in anger. I do wish US law enforcement would come down as hard on gun-owners as they do on rappers.
Its not long since Dylann Roof, 21, mowed down nine black worshippers in Charleston using a legal firearm.
The deadly weapons infesting America are not kettlebells, or even medicine balls. They are guns. In the US, people are killed with firearms at 297 times the rate of Japan and 49 times the rate of France.
There are 88 guns per 100 people in the US, the highest in the world. If Obama leaves office having done one decent thing, he will repeal the Second Amendment enshrining the right to bear arms. The Presidencys failure to do anything about the millions of deadly weapons in the Land of the Gun is a national tragedy.

Im taking the kids to Greece this summer, where its easier and actually cheaper to feed everyone in local tavernas than it is to eat at home.
But now VAT on eating out there may be hoicked to 23 per cent. So, yet again, the Greeks are getting a free lunch and we  the two million of us from the UK who go there each year  are paying.
Wail! I know were worried about Grexit and all that, but what about the cost of my big fat Greek holiday, and all my Mums nights off?

I wonder if she has noticed this change, or been worried by it. I suspect not. It has just happened to her, as it has happened to everyone else. We have quietly become a different people in a different country.
Like most of us, she has probably heard the slow advance of the EU into our national life as background noise, a dreary constant swoosh, like distant traffic.
Buckingham Palace insists, against all the evidence, that Her Majestys EU citizenship in no way affects her prerogatives, rights and responsibilities as the Sovereign and Head of State. Given that the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg is the final arbiter of law in this country now, and that Parliament and our so-called Supreme Court are subject to it, that simply isnt so.
Britain's Queen Elizabeth and Berlin's Mayor Michael Mueller speak to wellwishers on Pariser Platz in Berlin
Queen ends Berlin trip by driving through Brandenburg Gate
This sort of thing may appear mystical but actually it matters. Its why armies defend their standards to the end, why we have Royal symbols on state documents, postage stamps, the cap-badges of soldiers and policemen, coins and seals.
The EUs leaders know it matters. Thats why they made her an EU citizen. And how pleased they must have been to hear her, in Berlin on Wednesday, trotting out their standard propaganda line that division in Europe is a bad thing and that unity is the source of safety.
Really? For centuries, it was firm British policy to keep the Continent divided, to make sure its great powers left us alone. The safest period of my lifetime was the Cold War, when Europe was more sharply divided than ever.
As she spoke, the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, nodded enthusiastically. And if Mrs Merkel thought the Queen was making a political point, Id back her judgment against any statements or briefings from British officials.
Could Downing Street, the Foreign Office and Buckingham Palace have imagined for a second that such a speech would not be interpreted as an endorsement of Britains continued EU membership?
Yet all would have seen it in advance and the Government could have stopped it if they wanted.
They didnt. Without doubt, the Queens personal acceptance of her role as a loyal EU servant was one of the great symbolic moments of our history. A bit like Magna Carta, but backwards.

Farewell to the ultimate Englishman
I'm not sure I have ever enjoyed anything on TV as much as I liked watching Patrick Macnee playing John Steed in The Avengers, especially when Diana Rigg was at his side.
Here was an Englishman - funny, chivalrous, fundamentally gentle, yet deadly to his enemies.
From his obituaries, I gather that he was really like that. What a pleasant change it makes from all those actors, famous for playing noble roles, who turn out to have been secretly mean and nasty.
Real gentleman:Diana Rigg and Patrick Macnee in The Avengers in 1965. What a pleasant change to hear that people genuinely did see him as a gentleman and it wasn't purely an act
Crazed killers: The clue everyone ignores
When I lived in the suburbs of Washington DC, I was rather proud that my landlord was almost the only African-American in my unofficially segregated neighbourhood (the other one was the adopted child of our admirable next-door neighbours).
Like many American houses, ours had a small flagpole over the front door, normally used for the Stars And Stripes.
I asked the owner if hed object if I flew a Union Jack from it.
Not at all, he replied. You can fly any flag you like there, from anywhere in the world, as long as it isnt the Confederate Battle Flag.
For him, it was a nasty symbol of cruelty and hate.
From then on, I always took seriously the arguments of those who said the Confederate banner was a real issue, not just a bit of nostalgia.
And if it no longer flies in the grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol, I for one wont be grieving. Its one good effect of the Charleston massacre.
But what a pity that this dispiriting event has not led to any examination of the role of legal and illegal mind-altering drugs in rampage killings, an issue which is in my view much more pressing.
Its still going on. Authority doesnt look or doesnt care. Two and two are not put together.
The Charleston suspect, as Ive pointed out, appears to have been a drug abuser.
Now we have another  British  case which ought to have made people think, but hasnt.
The gruesome murder of the blameless 82-year-old mother and grandmother, Palmira Silva (her killer cut her head off), received less coverage than it should have. But it had much in common with two other recent crimes  the murder of Lee Rigby in 2011 by two obviously crazed men in London and the beheading of Jennifer Mills-Westley in Tenerife in 2011, also by a crazed individual.
All these killers had one thing in common  heavy cannabis use.
The frightful injuries they inflicted on their victims were signs that they were not sane.
The killers cannabis use was, in all cases, reported as a footnote or a side-issue. What if it is a cause?
But we will never find out if we do not look or ask.

There are no car chases or sex scenes in the interesting new film Mr Holmes. Instead, we see the great detective living out his final lonely years as a pottering beekeeper, played by Sir Ian McKellen in a silk top hat, left. Its a quiet, rather kind story full of thought. And it contains one heartfelt line from Holmes, who complains passionately that in real life, logic is very rare. So it is, and it is his steely attachment to reason and facts, while all about him jump to conclusions, that makes Holmes live on from age to age, in a hundred different incarnations.

Polka dots belong only on children.
We cant see her feet in these Ralph Lauren pants, so she could well be on castors.
Red nose rating: ** Warm Coco
KIM KARDASHIAN: LION TAMER
This is a perfect illustration of how not to wear palazzo pants: DO NOT FILL THEM OUT with your delicious curves.
Striped only exaggerate your wobbly bits. Again, these Balmain trousers are too long, so she has no feet.
Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown
JENNIFER LOPEZ: SHOW TIME

I love the colour and fabric of his Solace London pair, but again, why not wear a skirt?
But she looks pretty, fresh, and is laughing probably at the reflection in the mirror.

Red nose rating: *** Warm Coco
IMAN: RINGMASTER

I can see what she is trying to do here: a trompe loeil to make her legs leaner and longer.
The stripe in this Balmain design defeats the purpose of palazzos. If you want narrow legs, just wear toothpick jeggings.Fact-box text
Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown

LADY GAGA: WHAT A BOZO!
The ultimate clown.
And whod have thought the woman who wore a meat dress would wear something that looks as though it is linen and from Per Una at M&amp;S?
Just ghastly, and these Marni trousers are too bunchy round the waist.

Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown
PS: THE JOKE'S ON MEN TOO
Men are not exempt from this ridiculous trend... as this model on the Walter Von Beirendonck catwalk at Paris Men's Fashion Week proved.
If a man turned up on a date in this childish pink pyjamas-style suit, he'd be arrested.
I can't see men, used to a lean and narrow 'Hedi Slimane for Dior' shape, will take to these.
Red nose rating: * Coco the Clown
Thumbs up: Liz Jones said she looked and felt like Coco the Clown wearing the Palazzo pants
LIZ'S RED NOSE FASHION VERDICT
Posing in palazzo pants I not only looked and felt like Coco (the Clown, not Chanel), I was rendered so wide I could not only be used as a pair of curtains, I could cause a total eclipse of the sun.
The cropped pairs were even worse, turning me into a moving square.
Palazzo pants (in the 1970s, we called them Oxford bags) only look passable on the very young, very tall, and very thin  the stylist on the shoot, who is all of these things, kept saying shed wear these horrors on holiday.
Her friends can wave goodbye to any chance of getting a tan given the huge shadow theyll cast.
These trousers (Zara, 17.99) feel very cheap and nasty.
The fabric is so thin they give me a VPL, and the high waist means my fat tummy is accentuated.
Just awful. If I wore them on the beach, Id be worried a gust of wind would have me paragliding.

	George Harrison and Gordon Brown were right about tax writes JOHN REDWOOD

	I believe George Osborne should use next week's Budget to bring the top rate of tax back down from 45 to 40 per cent, writes JOHN REDWOOD, Tory MP for Wokingham.
      </Description>

Even Arsenals manager Arsene Wenger complained that the best footballers were being lured to Spain by their preferential top rate.
Once they were safely in opposition, Labour hurled insults at any Conservative who argued that we should return to a 40 per cent rate. They claimed that we just wanted tax breaks for our rich friends.
Despite this onslaught, the Coalition lowered the top rate to 45 per cent. I argued at the time that it would lead to greater tax revenues from the rich. And now I can prove that was right.
Gordon Brown was wrong about almost everything throughout his political career, but not about tax
An analysis of the latest Treasury figures shows that in 2009-10  the last year in which the 40 per cent rate applied  the top 1 per cent of all earners in the country paid 26.5 per cent of the total income tax revenue.
But during the three years in which the 50 per cent rate applied, the amount dropped to 25 per cent of all income tax. Then, in the first year of the 45 per cent rate, the amount shot up to 28 per cent.
What part of that extra money does Labour not comprehend?
At a time when the deficit inherited from Labours extravagant spending, and the great crash caused by Mr Browns boom and bust, is much too high, we need every extra penny of tax revenue we can get.
That means we need to get more from the rich by lowering the top rate. We will not tackle the deficit and provide vital public services if the UK blun-ders on with an uncompetitive tax rate which sends banking business to Hong Kong, high-tech entrepreneurs to California and media stars to Hollywood.
Many of the very rich work for themselves, or have big shareholdings in companies which pay them an income. This means they have enormous flexibility to raise or lower their incomes in response to the fiscal regime.
When the rate hit 50 per cent, many of them decided to pay themselves a lower income and simply reinvest the money in their businesses.
Either that, or they diverted their savings into assets that produced less income and more potential capital gain.
George Osborne should use next weeks Budget to bring the top rate of tax back down from 45 to 40 per cent
Now that the rate has gone down to 45 per cent, more rich people live here, more of them pay themselves higher incomes and more are prepared to pay the tax. If, for example, you look at the figures for self-assessment income tax  which includes a lot of the top payers  you see a stunning drop in revenues.
When the top rate rose to 50p, the Treasury forecast that the amount it would bring in would jump from 21.7 billion to 29.2 billion by 2013. Instead, it fell to 20.6 billion that year, a massive write-down of 8.6 billion.
The Treasury was wrong in forecasting the adverse impact of a higher rate, and also completely wrong about the level of economic growth.
So what would cutting the rate to 40 per cent do? It would boost revenues.
When former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson cut the top rate from 60 per cent to 40 in the 1980s, the rich paid more in tax, and they paid a higher share of the tax collected as a result.
Cutting the top rate in the next Budget will doubtless bring the same misinformed howls of anguish from the Left, who will claim that the Conservatives are always too soft on the rich.
Our response should be that we want to get more tax revenue from the rich  and are adopting Gordon Browns method of doing so. This Government should also cut the overall tax burden by removing the lower paid from income tax altogether, and by raising the 20p and the 40p thresholds for all.
Labour are now saying they wish to be a party of aspiration as well as a party of higher benefits. If you believe in this idea, then you need to allow those who succeed to keep more than half of what they earn.
The General Election result in May showed that voters are not, as Labour had hoped, jealous of those who work hard. The electorate understands that some people will do better than others, and accepts high wages for successful people who run their own companies or who have otherwise made their mark.
The Chancellor should be bold. Whatever he does, the Opposition will cry that the Conservatives are the party of the rich.
What we as a party have to show is that we are not trying to be exclusively on the side of the rich. Taxing them sensibly will mean they provide more money for the rest of us to spend, and more jobs to fuel the recovery.
The Government should ignore these baleful, misguided criticisms. It is time for Mr Osborne to heed the growing calls from his partys backbenches and unleash the animal spirits of the most enterprising elements of our society.
John Redwood is the Conservative MP for Wokingham and a former Cabinet Minister

	Ali Bin Muhammad Rezgui, the uncle of ISIS killer Seifeddine Rezgui, said his nephew had been a 'sweet' child, but began attending mosques run by radical Imams in recent years.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

By the time he launched his killing spree in Sousse, Rezgui was said to be working with IS, which yesterday posted a picture of him with two assault rifles either side of him, on its website.
Using Rezguis jihadi name, Abu Yahya al-Qayrawani, it described him as Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate.
ISIS extremists have claimed the massacre which left 38 dead was an 'attack upon the nests of fornication, vice and disbelief in God' - as they warned 'worse is to follow'.
The threat accompanied a picture of the man ISIS claim was behind the assault on innocent holidaymakers, who they name asAbu Yahya Qayrawani.
It is thought this is jihadi name of the killer fatally shot by authorities after Friday's attack, a 23-year-old aviation student called Seifeddine Rezgui, who was armed with an assault rifle and grenades.
Bodies lie on a beach in Sousse after gunmen opened fire on tourists at two hotels, killing at least 38
Killed: A 16-year-old British boy saw his grandmother and parents gunned down by the men who killed 38 (one pictured)
It has been reported that the attack happened on the private beach of the Royal Kenz Hotel, which is situated 400 metres away
The statement accompanying the picture added: 'Our brother, the soldier of the Caliphate, Abu Yahya al Qayrawani, reached his target the Imperial hotel despite the security measures.'
Sky report the statement goes on to say he had attacked a 'bordel' and killed 40 'infidels'.
It is yet to be confirmed whether this definitely is the same man who murdered 38 tourists staying at a hotel in Sousse, Tunisia.
Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid said Rezgui was not previously known by authorities, and came from the town of Gaafour in the governorate of Siliana and had been a student at Kairouan university.
A second gunman is reported to have escaped, but details remain unclear.
Eyewitness accounts say Rezgui was was seen laughing and joking among the midday bathers and sunseekers, looking like any other tourist.
But it was claimed he was carefully selecting the victims he would murder with a Kalashnikov hidden in his parasol.
Footage shows inside Seifeddine Rezgui's abandoned apartment
Images purporting to show the inside of killerSeifeddine Rezgui's apartment have emerged. The property appears to be filthy, while this image shows all he kept in the fridge was a few chili peppers
Rubbish litters the apartment, while on the dinner table appears to be a knife and fork, left there before he left to commit his atrocities
The British were his prime targets on the crowded Tunisian beachfront at El Kantaoui near Sousse.
But Germans, Belgians and Tunisians were also among his 38 victims  with 36 seriously wounded.
'He was laughing and joking around, like a normal guy,' said one witness. 'He was choosing who to shoot. Some people, he was saying to them 'you go away'. He was choosing tourists, British, French.'
Tonight images have also emerged purporting to show the inside of Rezgui's apartment.
The dirty flat is covered with rubbish, with a knife and fork still on the dinner table which were left there as he went out to commit his atrocities.
As the camera looks inside his fridge, there appears to be nothing inside except for two small potatoes and several chili peppers, while the inside is also covered with grime.

	The hard-liners will tip the balance of the 23-strong ruling council in favour of activists which has led MPs to fear their focus will move away from welfare and towards aggressive animal rights campaign.

He added: A lot of people give money to the charity for genuine animal welfare work. But it is the management and lack of governance that is letting the charity down.
The make-up of the committee is to be finalised this week and if MPs support his wish to investigate the charity, Mr Parish said he would summon RSPCA chiefs to be quizzed in public to find out how it is run and what improvements can be made.
MPs are especially anxious over the failure of the charity to appoint a new chief executive.
The former incumbent, Gavin Grant, left 18 months ago, due to ill-health. During his tenure he presided over high-profile campaigns against hunting, the badger cull and the Grand National. But what were seen as aggressive campaigning and bullying tactics in bringing prosecutions for animal cruelty provoked a public backlash.
RSPCA donations dropped by 7 million, the charity was forced to make redundancies and, for the first time in its history, had to arrange an overdraft facility.
Morale among RSPCA staff is said to be low, with many being forced to accept short-term rolling contracts.
Richard Ryder believes animals should never be killed for food, clothing or sport. An ex-chairman of the Political Animal Lobby, which donated 1.1m to Labour to ban hunting
A number of experienced people interested in the chief executive post have been put off by in-fighting between moderates and radicals on the council, plus its resistance to any change to the way members are elected.
For example, Dr Richard Ryder, regarded as the father of the modern animal rights movement, has served on the council since 1972, while the norm for charity council or board members these days is to serve a maximum three-year terms.
An indication of the influence of the hardliners running the RSPCA will be evident on Wednesday when the new council meets for the first time to elect a chairman.
Mike Tomlinson, the current chairman, a moderate, who has also been acting chief executive, has decided to step down from the role.
David Canavan, a barrister and considered moderate, is a favourite for the post.
But a number of animal welfare experts fear the post could go to a hardliner who would then influence the appointment of the new chief executive.
The make-up of the council roughly comprises ten moderates, ten hardliners and three who could vote for either side.
One charity chief said: If there are absentees, the vote is wide open. A lot of us are very worried that the charity could be at risk.
A Government animal welfare adviser added: The problem is, people are on the council for their ideology and not for their competence.
An RSPCA insider said: Weve had more than 100 applicants for the post of chief executive and interviews are still being held.
A Charity Commission spokeswoman said it was monitoring the RSPCA and in dialogue with its trustees but legally could not interfere with governance arrangements of charities.

	Wolfprint 3D offers face sculptures modelled from ultrasound scans

	Wolfprint 3D, an Estonian company, is offering expectant-mothers 3D sculptures of their unborn children for up to £300. It is the first time the technology has been seen in the UK.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
The images are sent to a 3D printer which creates the final likeness, layer-by-layer, from plastic resin.
Hannah Bramley, 27, is 35 weeks pregnant with her third child, a daughter, and chose to have a sculpture made by Wolfprint after having a detailed scan at a local clinic, Miracle in Progress, in Loughborough, Leicestershire. She paid 80 for the private 3D scan when she was 28 weeks pregnant, and a further 150 for the sculpture to be made  but says it was money well spent.
Emotional: Midwife Jo Proud poses with Hannah Bramley and her sculpture which she says has brought her closer to her unborn daughter
The ultrasound scan that 3D prints unborn baby sculptures
She said: I cried when I saw it for the first time. I had 3D scans done with both of my older boys but this was totally different. Its impossible to explain. You can touch it. My sister thought it was freaky, but I think its amazing. It feels like shes already here. Its strange, but I do probably feel closer to her than I did to my other babies when I was pregnant.
Joanna Proud of Miracle in Progress, added: Every mother likes to feel an extra bond with their unborn child.
Dr Bryan Beattie offers the service at Innermost Healthcare in Cardiff. He said: What you see is a little person who you can relate to, rather than a black and white image which you know is a foetus but could be anyones. The cost is still high because the technology is so new but were hoping it will come down as more people sign up. It could prove helpful for people expecting babies with facial deformities such as cleft lip, and even surgeons planning corrective operations after birth.
Technology: The sculpture is created from images of a 3D scan (seen above on an ultrasound monitor)
Standard NHS scans are generally only 2D and the image quality is poor because they are designed to see through the babys skin to view the internal organs.
But private clinics spend longer using standard ultrasound to take lots of two-dimensional slices which are put together to create a 3D effect. They also appear clearer because the organs are not shown.
The Health Protection Agency has warned women against so-called souvenir scans because of potential risks to the unborn baby, as they require longer and more intense exposure to ultrasound, the effects of which are untested
Kaspar Tiri of Wolfprint 3D, said: We were a company producing 3D models for architects and the construction industry and then a friends wife got pregnant, so we thought, why cant we create 3D models of the babies?
The reaction so far has been amazing. For a parent to not only see but touch their childs face before it is born is very special.

	The Queen guitarist, pictured, has recruited Sports Minister Tracey Crouch and up-and-coming MPs Dominic Raab and Caroline Dineage on his campaign to oppose the 'bloodsport'.

May said: I dont hate the man (Cameron) but I hate the fact that he wants to make hunting legal again. I find that abhorrent. He added that hunting was uniquely cruel because the people who are doing it are doing it for pleasure.
The Conservatives Election victory has led to some Tory MPs pressing Cameron to use the partys majority  and its traditional support for hunting  to lift the ban imposed by Tony Blairs Government.
They say it was outlawed for petty party political reasons and demonstrated ignorance of the countryside and rural traditions.
However, Mr May claims many young Tory MPs are on his side.
Brian May leads anti-badger cull protesters
Caroline Dineage, left, and Sports Minister Tracey Crouch are said to be supporting Brian May as part of his Team Fox which will oppose the re-introduction of fox hunting, rumoured to be on the cards thanks to a number of Conservatives who remain bitter about the ban introduced by the Blair Government
Newly appointed Ministers Dominic Raab and Caroline Dinenage are among those tipped to support May at his Commons meeting. It will be co-hosted by May and Andrea Jenkins, the Conservative MP and professional singer who defeated Ed Balls in the Election.
May said: A lot of independent-minded younger Tory MPs agree with us that fox hunting is cruel. They will vote according to their conscience.
The Government has no plans to end the Labour ban, but pro-hunting Tory backbenchers hope to launch their own bid. Tuesdays meeting is likely to witness lively exchanges after May invited pro-hunting Tory MPs to attend as well. May claims pro-animal rights Conservative ministers secretly supported his campaign to stop the Governments cull of badgers to combat TB in cattle.
He says that they contacted him to suggest how to undermine the cull.
Its not skulduggery. They were brave enough to say, My party thinks this but I disagree. I have a lot of friends in the Conservative Party, he said.
He refused to name the Ministers. Mays critics say he is irresponsible to oppose the badger cull, introduced to make cattle more healthy.
They also say that his claims about the cruelty of fox hunting are wildly exaggerated.

	The Navy spent £10 million on redundancy payments for 500 engineers in 2011, but is now urgently attempting to lure some of them back to fill a shortfall of 250 positions.

Naval engineers who have recently retired are also being rehired on one-year rolling contracts. A new advert on the Navys website says: The Royal Navy is actively seeking to re-recruit marine engineers and weapons engineers... If you miss the camaraderie, variety and challenge of engineering in the Navy then we can offer a tailored re-entry that could allow you to continue your rating career where you left off.
The Navy cut 5,000 sailors from the fleet in 2010 in a bid to fill a 38 billion black hole created by years of MoD mismanagement. But the fleet has now been left with a desperate skills gap.
Hiring again: The Royal Navy is being forced to rehire staff it made redundant to cover a shortfall
Last year, the frigate HMS Richmond had to withdraw from a major Nato training exercise in the Mediterranean after just three of its engineers fell ill.
Admirals have announced that ships deployed to the Gulf and South Atlantic will stay away from home for nine months rather than six because of the cuts and crew shortages.
Commanders also plan to borrow 36 engineers from the US Coastguard and have launched a recruitment drive in Commonwealth countries to find new engineers. Admiral Lord West, a former head of the Navy, described the situation as ludicrous last night, adding: Time and again we have been too fast to discard the services of highly trained people only to be caught short later on. We should be very wary in the future of discarding highly skilled people because inevitably circumstances change and you need them back.
Sources fear the Navy is in the cusp of a crisis after 630 personnel quit in the past year, including 12 per cent of engineering ratings and eight per cent of engineering officers. One senior source described the exodus as unprecedented, saying: So many are leaving because there are so few engineers in the UK and the top companies are willing to pay huge salaries.
A Navy spokesman said the service used innovative measures to address nationally acknowledged challenges, adding: These measures are already producing results allowing the Navy to continue to deliver maritime capability where it is needed.

More than 850 passengers had to be evacuated after their Mediterranean cruise ship collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Turkey, leaving a huge dent in its hull.
Authorities said a huge disaster was averted after emergency service quickly responded to reports that the Celestyal Crystal and the tanker STI Pimlico had crashed at 1.30am on Saturday morning in the Dardanelles Strait.
Cruise operators said two crew members and a passenger suffered minor injuries in the accident as the vessel, registered to Malta, made its way from Greece to Istanbul.
Evacuated: 853 passengers were taken off their ship, bound for Istanbul, after it collided with an oil tanker
Damage: The hull of the Celestyal Crystal was badly damaged after the incident at 1.30am on Saturday
Spill: Emergency services working quickly to stop a fire or explosion when oil poured out of the tanker
All of its 853 passengers and 382 staff were taken to safety by a sea bus to Gallipoil, and the rest of their journey was cancelled while structural damage to the front of the ship is being fixed.
Emergency services moved quickly to douse the tanker in water to prevent a fire or explosion after fuel spilled out of the 182-metre long tanker, which had been travelling from Russia to Malta carrying flammable naptha fuel.
It has not yet been established how the collision took place.

However, the same day medics at Great Ormond Street Hospital suggested they talk to Professor Shakeel Saeed, a neurosurgeon at University College London Hospitals. He wanted to expand the use of auditory brain implants in children in Britain.
But brain surgery had serious risks, the doctors stressed, especially to a toddler, and only a few such operations had ever been carried out on children worldwide. Furthermore, Prof Saeed had not performed the operation on a child before.
Mr Armitage, 42, who works for Royal Mail, recalled: We knew success rates varied. But the first time we met Professor Saeed, he put us at such ease.
The neurologist assembled a team with other experts and in May 2013 Leia had an operation in which they implanted 12 signal-carrying electrodes directly on to the brainstem. They mimic the auditory nerve, carrying electrical signals from a hearing aid type device directly to the brain. One of those involved in the operation, Dan Jiang  head of the Hearing Implant Centre at St Thomas Hospital in London  described the procedure as revolutionary for children with no auditory nerve. It is their only chance of ever accessing sound, he said.
Hope: Medics at Great Ormond Street Hospital suggested that the family talk to Professor Shakeel Saeed, a neurosurgeon at University College London Hospitals, whowanted to expand the use of auditory brain implants in children in Britain
By a quirk of fate, medics decided to switch the new machine on on Leias second birthday. However, they warned Leias parents there was no guarantee of success because initial scans suggested the device hadnt worked.
Mr Armitage said: That was a bad moment for us. We sat there thinking: What have we done? Weve put her through all this trauma, and quite possibly its not going to work.
Mrs Armitage added: When she was switched on, Bob and I didnt see any difference in Leia. But the experts saw movement in her eyes. They saw she was blinking to loud noises, and they were thrilled.
Then, on the Tube home, we noticed she was turning her head when the doors were closing, and shed never done that before. And we thought: Shes hearing something!
Prof Saeed said it was impossible to know how Leia experienced sound, but it was likely to be a very different sensation to those with normal hearing. Her parents said Leia can now understand a wide range of words. Mrs Armitage said: Her hearing has become really finely tuned, and shes hearing some quite low levels of sound now. Nobody in their wildest dreams thought shed get to that level with brainstem surgery.
On her third birthday, they sang Happy Birthday but Leia had not really understood it, they said.
But over the past year her hearing has improved so much that she had started to enjoy watching TV and listening to music.
Prof Saeed said the team hopes to carry out more such operations on children lacking auditory nerves: The alternative is a world of silence.
Better future: Mrs Armitage said nobody in their wildest dreams thought shed get to that level with brainstem surgery. Professor Saeed now wants to carry out more of the operations to help other children in Britain

According to some accounts, the terrorist also lobbed grenades at holidaymakers who became trapped in the corridor at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse.
Former RAF serviceman Mr Callaghan, 63, dived into a room with six other people and rammed desks and chairs against the door  before realising to his horror his wife of 40 years was not with him.
He told The Mail on Sunday: 'I looked around and Christine wasn't there. Then I could hear her screaming: 'Help me, I've been shot.''
With tears welling in his eyes, he added: 'At that moment I didn't know if she was going to die or not. I did think the very worst  that I was going to lose her.'
Mr Callaghan, who was himself suffering from a bullet wound to his right leg, nearly tore the barricade down to reach his wife but realised that doing so would endanger the others taking refuge in the room.
He said: 'You could hear the gunfire  we dared not open the door.'

Aftermath: Today staff at theImperial Marhaba Hotel were mopping up the blood which flowed from the victims of an ISIS gunman who opened fired on crowds of holidaymakers

Predator: Assault rifle in hand, Regzui was pictured stalking the streets of the popular holiday resort town Sousse where he and possible accomplices killed at least 38 people
His wife, who works as a healthcare assistant at Cromer Hospital in Norfolk, said: 'I felt the bullet hit me and I went straight down. My right leg was bent across my body and the pain was incredible.
'The bullet went into my beach bag, smashing everything and ricocheted off my sunglasses case and out into my femur.
'I'm lucky to be alive  without the beach bag there, the bullet would have gone straight into my abdomen and my vital organs.'
Despite her horrific injuries  the 60-year-old grandmother's thigh bone was shattered by a bullet  she managed to comfort another British woman who was writhing in pain next to her with four bullet holes in her back.
She said: 'I just started calling for Tony, then I saw a woman next to me with four bullet wounds. I was in a lot of pain but the woman next to me was much worse. She was very calm and quiet  she was bleeding badly.
'I kept talking to her and holding her hand. She told me her name was Shirley. Her husband, who said he was called Joe, was there but he was beside himself and just panicking.' She said she had later heard Shirley was recovering.

The terrorist attack happened in the popular holiday destination of Sousse in the north of Tunisia
After Rezgui had moved on, and it was safe to venture out of the office, Mr Callaghan not only had to care for his injured wife, but also had to break the news to a young British man named Liam that the fiancee he had planned to marry in two weeks was dead from bullet wounds to her chest.
He said: 'There was blood everywhere. I bent down and kissed my wife and said: 'Everything will be OK.' She was crying. I looked over Shirley's injuries for a second and knew I needed to help her.
'I heard the sound of someone talking five yards down the corridor so I walked down and there was a young guy holding a woman. She was on her back and had been shot in the chest and stomach.'
Mr Callaghan said: 'He looked up at me and said: 'What can I do? It's my fiancee and we are getting married in two weeks' time'.
DESPERATE TWITTER SEARCH FOR SURVIVORS
Many families turned to Twitter last night pleading for news about their loved ones.
Sara Boyle tweeted: 'Ray and Angela Fisher missing in Sousse. Please retweet this  please help. Angela often called Angie.'
And Samuel Stocker wrote: 'Find John and Janet Stocker#Tunisia #SousseAttacks.'
The family of John Welch, 74, from Wiltshire and his partner Eileen Swannack, 70, said they had not spoken to them since Thursday.
Mr Welch's grandson Daniel Welch, 29, from Swindon, said: 'We can only expect the worst.'
Missing: Samuel Stocker wrote: 'Find John (right) and Janet (left) Stocker#Tunisia #SousseAttacks' - his mother and father
Heartbroken: Sara Boyle tweeted: 'Ray (top) and Angela Fisher (bottom) missing in Sousse. Please retweet this'
Disappeared: The family of John Welch (right), 74, from Wiltshire and his partner Eileen Swannack left), 70, said they had not spoken to them since Thursday
'He said she was getting cold and I bent down and checked her pulse. She was dead, I could tell. He said his name was Liam.
'I just said to him: 'Sorry, Liam, I can't find her pulse.' I didn't know what else to say. She was just a young girl. I had seen them arrive, they looked a lovely couple and very happy. It's just heart-breaking.'
Last night the Liam Mr Callaghan described was believed to be Liam Moore, who lost his fiancee Carly Lovett, 24, a photographer, beautician and fashion blogger from Lincolnshire, in the attack.
Mr and Mrs Callaghan's ordeal began when they were sitting around the pool at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel and heard gunshots from the beach 100 yards away.
Speaking from his hospital bed, Mr Callaghan, who works for Norfolk police and lives with his wife in North Walsham, said many of the holidaymakers thought the noise was fireworks but because of his military training he recognised the ominous bangs and urged everyone to run for safety.
Silent: The beach would have been filled with tourists yesterday, but now it is taped off - with thousands of tourists now waiting to board emergency flights home after the horrendous attack
Contemplative: Tourists sit at the terrace of the Imperiale Marhaba hotel after a gunman opened fire at the beachside hotel in Sousse
Embrace: Scared tourists comfort one another at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel having survived the terrifying gun attack outside the beachside hotel
Once in the hotel, they were directed up a staircase to the left of the lobby by staff but they heard the gunman behind them and realised they were trapped.
Another couple, Ross Thompson, 21, and Rebecca Smith, 22, from Coventry, were treated for shrapnel wounds apparently caused by a grenade.
Miss Smith had injuries to her face, head, arms and legs, while Mr Thompson, a fire safety engineer, was lucky not to lose a toe. He said: 'The gunman was behind us, shooting. There was a puff of smoke and I felt shrapnel hit my foot.
'The adrenaline kept me going and we managed to get into an office off the corridor and barricade ourselves in. Becky hid under a desk.'
Miss Smith said: 'I've never been so scared in my whole life. You are on holiday relaxing  you just don't expect something like this to happen. It's terrible. I don't feel safe in this hospital. I just want to get out of here as soon as possible.'
Survivors:Rebecca Smith (top), 22, and her boyfriend Ross Thompson (bottom) came face to face with a Tunisian terroristwhen bungling hotel staff sent them fleeing down a dead-end corridor
Emergency: Dozens of British tourists are being treated at the Sahloul University Hospital in Tunisia
In a miraculous escape, Tom Richards, a university graduate who was on holiday with his mother and younger brother, found himself face-to-face with the terrorist in the hotel. Rezgui shot two people in the head, before turning his attention to Mr Richards.
The 22-year-old said: 'He looked right at me, I thought I was dead.'
But instead of shooting Mr Richards, he shot the floor  allowing Mr Richards and his mother, who were injured by shards of marble, to escape to a nearby toilet. 'I don't know why he stopped. He could have killed everybody,' he said.
Other injured Britons include Kirsty Murray, 25, from Braintree, Essex, who was being treated for four gunshot wounds to her wrists and legs after Rezgui opened fire as she relaxed by the pool.
Her fianc, Radley Ruszkiewicz, who turned 29 yesterday, suffered shrapnel wounds to his lower legs which he thinks were caused by a grenade thrown by the terrorist.
They were being treated at different hospitals in Sousse.
MISSING BRITONS CONFIRMED DEAD AS SONS PAY TRIBUTE ON TWITTER
Two Britons missing in Tunisia following the attacks yesterday have been confirmed dead.
Suzanne Davey, 44, and partner Scott Chalkley, 42, had been on holiday together in Sousse to celebrate buying their first house together when the shootings broke out.
Their sons Conor Fulford and Ross Naylor had spent all of yesterday frantically appealing on social media for information on the pair, but late last night confirmed they had both died.
Briton Suzanne Davey, 44 (left), and her partner Scott Chalkley, 42 (right), who were reported missing in Tunisia have been confirmed as dead, their sons have said
Paying tribute to mother Ms Davey on Twitter, Mr Fulford wrote: 'Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight.'
Mr Fulford began his frantic search for information after seeing what he believed to be his mother's body on a stretcher on Sky News.
His frantic appeals received thousands of retweets and shares online, as Tunisia's foreign minister said at least 15 Britons were among the dead.
Meanwhile, Mr Chalkley's son Ross was making similar appeals, before sending out a final tweet confirming that his father had been killed.
He wrote: 'Tonight, me and Brad lost our Dad, unfortunately he was caught up in the sickening attacks in Tunisia and is no longer with us.
'I want to say thanks to everyone who has helped, you have all been amazing. One love to all and rest in peace Dad.'

	London Mayor hopeful Ivan Massow and his VERY modern family

	Multi-millionaire Ivan Massow is living with the gay mother of his child and has a 20-year-old boyfriend. He hopes to be the Tory candidate for the Mayor of London elections.

He would have two mothers, but I saw myself helping out with nappy changing, playing football in the park, babysitting, going on holidays and being very much involved, Ivan says.
But just three months into the pregnancy, the women suddenly parted. Ivan wont reveal why the seemingly solid partnership floundered, saying only that its very sad.
The babys mother has declined all requests to comment and does not want to be interviewed. Which must be awkward for a man who has never been shy about discussing what he calls his chequered background  everything from male escorts, recreational drugs, alcoholism, depression and two suicide attempts. I believe in transparency, he says by way of explanation.
It is a refreshing, if potentially dangerous, trait for a budding politician. He has been teetotal since 2008, surrounding himself with other non-drinkers, and today lives quite frugally, flying easyJet, wearing M&amp;S shirts and giving thousands of pounds every month to charities and people he mentors.
During his colourful life, he has made a fortune, lost it and made it again. He was also sensationally fired as chairman of the Institute of Contemporary Art in 2002, after branding most conceptual art as pretentious, self-indulgent, craftless tat.
Living together: Ivan Massow shares his home with his gay life partner Mila who is expecting his child
Together: Ivan, pictured here with his 20-year-old boyfriend Harry Winter, could run for London Mayor
Ivan Massow is running to be the next Mayor of London (related)
It is his disarming honesty that makes him want to open up about everything. Nothing is sacred: from the time he stopped his father killing himself, to the homophobia some gay people direct at him, his abusive childhood and now his burning desire to become a father.
For although it is usually women who feel the tick of their biological clock, Ivan has long yearned to have a family. Its really important to me. I love kids and I have strong nurturing instincts, he says.
Having a child explains life. Without them, there is that thing missing. That need to provide and care. It will complete me in many ways.
Perhaps this desperate need stems from his own difficult childhood. When he was 12, his mother had to put him up for adoption after his father turned abusive. She had friends on the game; it was a different world, Ivan says uncritically.
When Ivan decided that he wanted to become a father, he researched adoption but felt his fame and chequered past counted against him.
He looked into finding a surrogate mother who would carry his child, and discovered a website that helps match up surrogates and sperm donors.
The procedure is a bit like online dating  only with higher stakes.
After two years of searching on the site, he found the perfect couple and they sent him their details.
Having a child explains life. Without them, there is that thing missing. That need to provide and care. It will complete me in many ways.
Several months later, after phone calls and emails, they met over coffee at the British Film Institute on Londons South Bank last year, but at that stage he was again holding out hope of adopting a child.
We seemed to fit very well, Ivan says. I told them I wanted to see how it turned out.
We remained in contact, then one day, when I realised I wasnt going to be able to go down the adoption route, I phoned them and said, Its time. Lets do it.
I was 46 and in my view time was running out because I didnt want to be too old for my child when hes in his late teens. The adoption process was taking so long. I didnt want to push it any further.
HE WAS particularly impressed that the couple were in a solid and secure 13-year relationship. They were so excited about having a child and they wanted the child to have a male role model in its life. They could have gone to a sperm donor clinic, but it was important for them to create something that was as close to being a traditional family unit, in their eyes, as possible.
The insemination  via a kit  worked immediately. It was amazing that we got lucky with the first attempt. I was absolutely delighted, gushed Ivan with masculine pride.
He is surprisingly happy with the domestic arrangement. When I first heard that they had parted, it was no question that I would do anything but say she had to come and live with me. Its going really well. Its nice.
Anyone might think that coping with a new baby is hard enough, without the added stress of two virtual strangers moving in together in a new relationship. But the five-bedroom mansion is more than large enough for mother and child to have their own floor  there is also a separate flat in the basement.
Still, it is an unusual set-up even in a world of increasingly flexible families. It seems very strange to be re-inventing the notion of an arranged marriage, muses Ivan. What we have is full of respect and kindness. We sit down and work out what would make life easier.
From what kind of school, to what food and how strict. Because when you have a proper relationship, these are the kinds of things you use to select your partner, based on your values. We are thrashing out what each other expects and being very polite, because we want to remain living together until the child is an adult. At least thats the plan.
Theyve even talked about how to conduct their personal relationship. Making sure that there is enough private space so that each can have independence, while at the same time ensuring that the child  and any others that might follow  feels it is a safe environment.
IVAN MASSOW SAYS JOAN COLLINS SAVED HIS LIFE IN ST TROPEZ
Multi-millionaire Ivan Massow has revealed the night that Joan Collins saved his life while he was staying at her villa in St Tropez.
The Dynasty stars intervention came seven years ago when Massow drank a staggering six bottles of wine.
She told him: I had just one glass last night. Nearly all the rest must have been you. I think you have a problem.
Massow, who has been teetotal for seven years, says: I wasnt a park bench drunk. Its about the light going out of your eyes and she was able to help me switch it back on. It was just before my 40th birthday.
He added: I get a lot of stick for my celebrity contact, but she has been a deep, deep personal mentor for 25 years and its just a coincidence that she is well-known.
Life-saver: Ivan Massow said Joan Collins saved his life after he drank six bottles of wine
Unlike Ivan, his son will want for nothing. He grew up with either foster carers or adopted family, leaving school with just one O-level, and ended up living in London at the age of 19. He started his financial consultancy business from a squat in Kentish Town, North London, at just 23. It arranged insurance for gay people during the worst days of Aids hysteria, when many faced inflated premiums.
It was wildly successful and by his 30s Ivan had four Bentleys, several houses and boats  along with a retinue of staff. Along the way, he also garnered a list of celebrity friends, from Geri Halliwell and George Michael to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. None is closer than Dame Joan Collins, who he calls his second mum. She has already been lined up as Nicos godmother.
Ivan also became a key Conservative Party supporter, accompanied Margaret Thatcher to the partys conference in 1999 and was an adviser to William Hague. Justice Secretary Michael Gove used to be a flatmate and he partied with a young George Osborne.
Which is why, until recently, he was considered the frontrunner to bag the Tory nomination to succeed Boris Johnson as Mayor of London next year. Until, that is, the partys favoured son Zac Goldsmith threw his hat into the ring three weeks ago. Ivans irritation at this last-minute competitor is palpable, but he refuses to indulge in political trash talking. Instead, he cheerily says: Weve known each other for 25 years. We go to dinner occasionally and we share lots of friends.
I dont want to judge him or his ability to resonate with Londoners. But I will say that I am troubled by the fact that more jobs, from acting through to the City, are moving away from Thatchers meritocratic revolution. Today, people from the right families are given the jobs because they have the right accents and went to the right schools. Thats not the world I want to live in.
Fatherhood, he says, feels all the sweeter because it has been a long time coming. I tried having a child with single women I knew, but it seemed as soon as I found someone they would find a partner and want to have a family with that person.
He has twice tried to adopt but found that his colourful history and high profile were obstacles. The agency was not just concerned about a potential relapse into drink and drugs, but also worried about his Google-count, as he calls it.
When Boris Johnson announced that he would not stand for re-election, I knew that I had to go for it and that it would blow my chances to adopt. Fortunately, the baby offer came up and it was a sure thing.
He might be in the grip of baby fever and so excited that its almost embarrassing, but he is determined that having a child wont get in the way of his bid to become London Mayor. Nothing will. Ive been preparing for the Conservative hustings for almost a year now. But I still turn up to all the scans and classes like an obedient spaniel. Im providing the home and I think its really important that my co-parent is able to control that end of things.
Ill be there for the birth, but standing from a certain angle, he laughs. Joan Collins thinks this new trend of fathers being so involved in the birth of a baby is vulgar  but she is very funny when she says it.
He has shut down all his businesses to focus on becoming Mayor. Money, he insists, has never really been his driver.
Im not your typical politician. I take the Tube, hate conventional politics and I love London. I came into this as a total outsider, but I would have been very disappointed with myself if I had not had the courage to stand. I think Im the partys best chance of a win. I know first hand what its like to have nothing and survive in this city.
If he fails in his bid, no doubt baby Nico will help to ease the pain.

	British Monarchy renting out flats in St James's Palace for first time in history

	Prospective tenants looking at a luxury apartment in London soon to go on the market will find that it will be a matter of keeping up with the Windsors rather than the Joneses.

This might seem a lot but not when you consider Prince Charles official residence Clarence House is next door, while the Princess Royal, Princess Alexandra, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie have homes inside the palace.
In theory, anyone can apply but all prospective tenants will be subject to security and background checks, a palace source told The Mail on Sunday.
Neighbours inside the palace will include Princesses Eugenie (pictured left) and Beatrice (right)
Prince George was christened at icnoc St James' Palace
The apartment is the second one in recent months to go up for rent. Apartment 29B at St Jamess Palace went on the market last year.
The rent for this property is even more expensive as it is larger  it has five bedrooms and it is spread over four floors. Apartment 29A used to be occupied by the Ministry of Defence and prior to that it housed staff members of the Royal Household.
The unfurnished property is deceptively luxurious  it is set over two storeys with open fireplaces and a grand staircase.
With mounting bills to restore crumbling palaces, the Royal Household is keen to find income from renting out properties.
Documents seen by The Mail on Sunday suggest courtiers are also considering plans to rent out a third apartment at St Jamess, Apartment 30B.
The rental income from these dwellings is expected to help recoup the cost of essential renovations to St Jamess Palace. It will also boost the Monarchys rental income  which last year rose to 2.8 million.
Prince Charles (pictured with wife Camilla) official residence Clarence House is next door to the palace
St Jamess Palace, which is not open to the public, was built by Henry VIII in the 16th century.
The plans are all revealed in the Queens Annual Report, published last week. The document states: Every opportunity is taken to supplement the Sovereign Grant through growth in the number of properties available for commercial letting and reducing the number of vacant properties within the security cordon.
The Royal Household has a forward-looking plan that explores the scope to free up properties for commercial letting and identifies properties on the Estate which do not contribute to the Households operations. Three years ago  during the Queens Diamond Jubilee and London Olympics  the Palace allowed businesses to rent its Throne Room, Tapestry Room and Queen Anne Room.
The Queen allowed Perks Field at Kensington Palace to be hired by the Russian Olympic team during the 2012 London Games.
The Public Accounts Committee, which monitors expenditure in public life, has called on the Royal Household to save money.
Last year, there were questions over the spiralling cost of renovations to William and Kates apartment at Kensington Palace, which reached 4 million.

	Pete Doherty, three tragic deaths and one chilling connection
      </title>

	They were young, talented and had their whole lives ahead of them, but Robyn Whitehead, Mark Blanco and Alan Wass all died before their time. Their connection? Infamous rock star Pete Doherty.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Now, however, he feels it is time to speak out.
Whitehead, who is writing a book which threatens to expose the seedy world of Doherty, accuses the rock star of breaking her down during the row that took place just hours before her death.
Pete Doherty and Alan Wass argued that she was not trying to tell the right story about Pete Doherty in the film she was making, he says.
They believed she would not tell the truth but Robyn stood her ground. She was an intelligent girl.
Robyn Whitehead, a glamorous heiress to the wealthy Goldsmith dynasty, died after taking heroin
She knew exactly what she was doing and then Wass came along, together with Doherty, that Saturday afternoon and attacked her mentally and broke her down.
A day after the confrontation with Doherty over the documentary, Robyn was found dead in a dingy flat belonging to one of his friends. Her father says: Robyn rang her mother after the row. She was terribly upset.
Whitehead says he had originally started the film project, but passed it on to his daughter.
He says: I had decided I was wasting my time and had better things to do. It was at that point that Robyn, who had been working with me, said Dad, let me finish it.
So unfortunately it was me who introduced Robyn to Pete Doherty on the basis that she would go on to finish my film. It is for me to remember that I introduced them.
While Whitehead starts work on a book about his daughter, another inquest is due to take place. Despite being one of his closest friends, Doherty is unlikely to appear at Westminster Coroners Court in two weeks time when the inquest into the death of Alan Wass begins.
Wass died two months ago of an apparent heart attack after severing an artery in his arm when he fell through a window.
For his mother, Angela, the grief of coming to terms with her only sons death is compounded by the fact that Alans reputation will forever be framed by Doherty.
Sitting on her sofa in her semi-detached home in North London, Angela looks at the ceramic urn in the front room containing her sons ashes. She says: They were friends before Doherty was famous and they carried on their friendship. Doherty was best man at Alans wedding. Alan was a true friend to him.
Alan had just signed a massive record deal. It was the break of his life. His career was taking off.
My son lived for music and he died for music.
Who would think that at 33 he would be dead? When I saw him in that coffin all I wanted him to do was to wake up.
I had made my will just a month before he died and the solicitors came back to me. They said you have not ticked the box in the event that your children pre-decease you and asked me what to do. I told them I did not need to do that because my children would not pre-decease me. Whoever thinks your child is going to die before you?
When I saw him in that coffin all I wanted to do was to wake up
Dohertys rise to fame, if not immediate fortune, began in 1997 with his band The Libertines. Wass played alongside him in the charismatic band whose eponymous album topped the charts in 2004.
Their cult reputation was sealed by Dohertys very public descent into drug addiction and dysfunction that eventually led to him serving time in prison.
At the height of their fame, Doherty was asked to leave the band and eventually the group disbanded, leaving Doherty free to focus on his next band Babyshambles.
His career and drug addiction tracked that of his close friend Amy Winehouse and Dohertys reputation was further enhanced by his tumultuous relationship with supermodel Kate Moss.
Moss and Doherty met in 2005 and their on-off affair only reached the end of the road in 2007, but by then Doherty had already become ensnared in a highly controversial death.
In May 2011, he was jailed for six months for possession of crack cocaine. The singers downfall was sealed by footage that had emerged showing him smoking crack with Robyn Whitehead and Alan Wass.
Two months after his conviction, Winehouse  the multi award-winning singer  died after losing her battle with alcohol.
A fan who modelled himself on Doherty also lost his life after a heroin overdose that year. One of those present at the flat on the night of Mark Blancos death was Johnny Headlock Jeannevol, once a close friend and security manager for Doherty.
After suffering from ill health for several years, Mr Jeannevol believes that he has turned the corner but only after cutting all ties with the controversial singer.
Pete Doherty presents his 'Hope Rehab Thailand Tour'
Alan Wass, pictured on his wedding day to Liza. Doherty was best man at the ceremony, and his mother said he was a 'true friend' to the singer, adding:My son lived for music and he died for music'
He said: I had to stay away from Pete for the sake of my health. It is stressful being with Pete and I had to calm down. I dont have his number any more. But I heard through friends that he was a bit gutted Alan had passed away and was a bit shaken up by it.
When asked why people around Doherty pay such a price, Mr Jeannevol cannot resist a well-worn phrase. He said: Its rock n roll, isnt it?
Mark Blancos mother is still battling with police to discover what really happened the night her son fell from a balcony to his death.
The CCTV footage recovered from the scene would subsequently become the focus of a long-running legal battle between his family and the Metropolitan Police.
An FBI-accredited expert believes that footage of the balcony seconds before Blanco fell proves incontrovertibly that there was another person with him  begging the question of whether he was pushed.
At the subsequent inquest it emerged that Blanco, who once worked for Goldman Sachs, had visited the flat of Paul Roundhill, a close friend of Doherty, in a bid to publicise a play Blanco was putting on.
Doherty had told an acquaintance to 'have a word' with Mark Blanco, and an inquest rejected suicide. But in an interview in 2012, Doherty claimed the police knew he was innocent, although admitted it 'does look dodgy'
Bizarrely the play, Accidental Death Of An Anarchist, features a character who dies after falling out of a window. Roundhill admitted that he had punched Blanco in the face several times.
It also emerged that Doherty had told an acquaintance to have a word with Blanco.
The inquest recorded an open verdict and rejected suicide. The corner called for a fresh investigation.
In an interview with the NME in 2012, Doherty claimed the police understood he was innocent.
The murder squad down at Limehouse, yeah, they opened and closed that case three or four times. The pressure they put on me was completely minimal.
And they kind of said off-tape Pete, were sorry about this, right, but the family are convinced that their son was murdered. I can understand it and it does look dodgy.
In two weeks time, Westminster Coroners Court will hear the inquest of Alan Wass.
A spokesman for Doherty said: The inquest into Alan Wass is pending and therefore it would clearly be inappropriate to comment. Peter Doherty fully co-operated with the police at all times in relation to Mark Blanco and there were no criminal implications for Peter Doherty at all.
On Friday night, Doherty was back on the stage when he performed a surprise gig at the Glastonbury festival.
Swigging from a bottle of beer, he dedicated the song Time For Heroes to his late bandmate, saying: Alan Wass, if youre up there looking down. Or down there looking up.
But Blancos mother Sheila, who is still waiting for a review of the evidence of her sons death, warns Alans parents that they shouldnt expect to hear any words of comfort from the star.
Sheila Blanco says: Doherty has never come forward to say anything about this case. Nor has he ever apologised to me.
He has never even spoken to me.

Former Minister Peter Lilley said the problem was so acute he would introduce a Bill into Parliament to force EU countries whose citizens default on their payments to make up the shortfall.
The Tory MP for Hitchin and Harpenden said: It is many millions of pounds and is one of the hidden costs of the European Union we need to rectify.
Under European law, students from the EU can apply for the same Government-backed loans as English students to complete courses in the UK  and more than 90,000 have now taken out loans. While English students automatically repay loans through the tax system, similar systems are not in place for those living in mainland Europe.
EU students are supposed to keep in touch with the Student Loans Company but many move addresses and bank accounts and cannot be traced. Although defaulters can be pursued through the courts, the cost of legal action is often more than the original debt.
Untraceable: Many EU students change addresses and bank accounts, meaning the Student Loans Company cannot find them

The Director of Public Prosecutions was facing calls to quit last night as her decision not to prosecute alleged paedophile Lord Janner was dramatically overturned.
The legal U-turn came just days after The Mail on Sunday revealed that the Labour peer had made secret visits to Parliament despite medics claiming he was too ill to be questioned by police.
Critics insisted Alison Saunders could not continue as the head of the Crown Prosecution Service when she had made such a catastrophic mistake over the high-profile case of the 86-year-old, who is accused of molesting boys in care.
Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was facing calls to quit last night as her decision not to prosecute alleged paedophile Lord Janner was dramatically overturned
She provoked fury among police chiefs when she ruled in April that Lord Janner could not be prosecuted because of his dementia, despite detectives collecting enough evidence to charge him with 22 offences against nine victims in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
Mrs Saunders, who earns 205,000 a year, strongly defended her decision  but an external QC was drafted in to reconsider the case after a challenge from alleged victims.
Last night it emerged the CPS has accepted the reviews decision to let the case be heard in court.

Campaigning Labour MP Simon Danczuk  who declared in the Commons last week that Lord Janner had violated, raped and tortured children on school trips to Westminster  led the calls for the DPP to quit.
Mrs Saunders already faced pressure after the 20million failed prosecution of journalists over paying public officials, and the show trial of a doctor accused of female genital mutilation that ended with his acquittal in less than half an hour.
Mr Danczuk said last night: I think she should go. There was a lack of transparency over the decision, she had the case for more than a year, she made the decision when Parliament wasnt sitting and there were doubts about conflicts of interest over the advice.

But more than that we need somebody at the head of the CPS who can not only make legal decisions but someone who also has emotional and political intelligence.
Shes been totally out of touch with public opinion on this and The Mail on Sunday was right to make this such a big issue, as weve had to drag our justice system kicking and screaming into the 21st Century.

Liz Dux of law firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing many of the peers alleged victims, said: This would be total vindication of what my clients have been asking for all along ... they have wanted to give evidence for many years and now look forward to doing so.
Lord Janner will face a trial of the facts  a legal process used when suspects are deemed unfit to enter pleas, instruct lawyers or follow proceedings. A jury will hear the evidence against him and will decide if he did the facts, but there will be no verdict and no sanction.
In some trials of facts, judges can impose hospital orders if the public needs to be protected from a dangerous suspect, but Lord Janner is not considered to pose such a risk.
Daniel Janner, the peers son who is himself a QC, said the matter was now sub judice and he could not comment.
The unprecedented U-turn on a DPPs personal decision comes days after The Mail on Sunday revealed that Lord Janner used his Parliamentary car park pass, signed cheques and told clerks he was there on official business in June 2014  months after police had been told he was too ill to be interviewed.
It can also be revealed today that Lord Janner still has two laptop computers provided by the House of Lords, and reported his Blackberry lost last July, although he no longer has an office in Millbank.
A CPS spokesman said last night: We cannot confirm the outcome of the review until all of the parties have been informed.

	Carly Paoli, 26, has shared a Hollywood stage with actress Kate Hudson and boasts American Idol coach Paula Abdul among her fans. Not bad for a lorry driver’s daughter from Mansfield.

Her older brother Dean is a builder and her father Paul is a lorry driver who transports coal and ash in the Midlands.
Hes often covered in dust when he comes home, says Carly.

You may not yet have heard of Carly but in music circles she is being hailed as the next Katherine Jenkins
Mum makes him strip down to his underpants in the porch even if weve got visitors.
And though Carlys mum Tina is Italian and Carly is bilingual there were no opera buffs in the family. None of us have any idea where my passion has come from, she says.
But from as long ago as they can remember they just couldnt stop me singing.
At school, her teachers spotted her potential and suggested she have singing lessons, which she started when she was eight.
With her sights on the West End stage, she applied to the Arts Educational School in Hertfordshire, alma mater of Downton actresses Jessica Brown Findlay and Lily James, who was in her class.
After the school principal invited a guest from The Royal Northern College of Music to the end-of-year show, Carly was offered a place on the spot.
She graduated in vocal studies four years later, aged 23, and got a job teaching at her old dance school, supplementing her income with private performances at weddings and corporate events.
The latter brought her lucky break. Carlys voice  and no doubt her easy-on-the-eye looks  caught the attention of luxury Swiss watch company Bedat &amp; Co, who signed her up as a brand ambassador.

That association, in turn, brought her to the attention of the 16-time Grammy Award wining record producer David Foster who helped launched the careers of Celine Dion and Whitney Houston.
Last September, he asked Carly to perform at his glitzy charity gala in Calgary, Canada, where she shared the bill with Aerosmiths Steven Tyler.
Two months later, she was invited to perform at the International Womens Media Foundation awards, hosted by Hudson.
To crown her memorable year, she will take to the stage at the Teatro dellOpera Di Roma, where she will sing solo and with Cynthia Lawrence, the American soprano who was Pavarottis favourite female artist.
The comparisons to Katherine Jenkins are inevitable, but Carly says: Were actually quite different. I like to think I am creating a new sound and I hope when the public gets to know me theyll see that.
Either way, there is little doubt that if they dont know it already, music lovers will soon know her name very well indeed.

And he says he only sticks with his barely penetrable Austrian intonations because its what his fans expect.
Its now become such a big part of me, the accent, that people really enjoy it, explained the 67-year-old, whose latest movie Terminator Genisys opens in Britain on Thursday.

	Alexander Harrild, 29, who attended the prestigious Dulwich College in London, has told police in Santiago that he will co-operate with them in order to secure a lesser jail sentence on drug trafficking charges.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

In a court appearance the day after his arrest, he told the judge: I always liked to consume them [drugs] and basically when my business started going badly I didnt know what to do. I had to pay taxes and things, unexpected things, and somebody suggested I distribute drugs.
His new circumstances are a far cry from his upper-middle-class background in Britain as the son of the London Symphony Orchestras principle tuba player, Patrick Harrild, a former chairman of the orchestra and a long-serving member of its governing body.
He was also a professor at both the Royal Academy of Music  of which he was an honorary member  and Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
Patrick, 63, had been due to play with the LSO  regarded as one of the worlds best ensembles  at an open-air concert in Trafalgar Square last month but instead flew to Chile to be with his son after learning of his arrest.

Harrild, too, was a gifted musician. As a teenager, he played with the prestigious European Youth Orchestra and received extra tuition at the Purcell School in Hertfordshire, where many of Britains finest musicians are trained. He graduated from Dulwich College in London  whose old boys include Jeeves and Wooster creator PG Wodehouse, explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton and Ukip leader Nigel Farage  in 2004, and five years later emigrated to start his new life in Chile.
Initially he boasted in online interviews that his food delivery business, called Comamos Algo  Lets Eat Something  was expanding. But when The Mail on Sunday visited the address listed on the companys website, it turned out to be a shuttered, seemingly derelict, building.
Chilean police laid out evidence, pictured, seized after they arrested Alexander Harrild for drug trafficking
In his first court appearance, on May 6, he blamed his drug-dealing on the failure of the business, which worked with 300 restaurants in the Santiago area. This newspaper has obtained a recording of his first court appearance in which he told the judge, in Spanish: I always liked to consume drugs and then basically when my business started going badly I had to pay bills.
I have a real job with a contract... I had a good job with a decent salary. My business didnt go well and I needed extra money.
He added, in English, that he then turned to dealing drugs over problems with his tax bill.
Harrild, pictured, emigrated to Chile to join the Santiago Philharmonic Orchestra
Deputy police commissioner Christian Vasque showed The Mail on Sunday pictures of the 16 grams of cocaine, 28 grams of marijuana and 50 ecstasy tablets they said they found in Harrilds possession, and read from the official 45-page police report into his case. At that initial court case, Harrild said that his wife, who comes from a distinguished military family, was not involved in his activities.
A police officer who interviewed Harrilds wife on the night of his arrest said she was distraught by the incident.
She was beside herself, he revealed. She said, How could I not have known this? I cant believe he did this s***?
He is my ex-husband after this episode. She was distraught and very upset.
Speaking to The Mail on Sunday last night, Maria shook her head and said of Alex: Hes a very stupid boy and added that he came from a very nice family.
The couple have been together for at least three years and several members of the Harrild family flew to Chile for their wedding in December.
Last night, a senior Santiago police officer, Hugo Haeger, underlined the seriousness of the charges  and how Harrild might get a reduced sentence if he were to name names.
He told The Mail on Sunday: He admitted to trafficking drugs immediately on his arrest. In cases like this it is common for someone to co-operate with prosecutors in order to identify those who are higher up the drug chain. They do this in order to receive a lesser sentence.
It is likely that he is co-operating with prosecutors and coming to some sort of deal. If he were to give information that led to the arrest of those who sold the drugs to him he could get a lighter sentence.
A source close to Harrild confirmed that he was hoping to strike a deal that would allow him to avoid a lengthy jail sentence, but instead have to report to a parole officer once a week  a deal that would forbid him from leaving Santiago.
He is currently being held in a section of Santiagos notorious 100-year-old Uno prison specially reserved for foreigners.
He is in there with murderers and rapists, Mr Haeger said. He will be sharing a cell for sure.
Harrild attended the prestigious 35,000-a-year Dulwich College pictured where he excelled at music
The jail is dangerously overcrowded  holding 1,500 more prisoners than the 2,500 it was built for a century ago  and last year was the scene of a vicious fight in which two inmates died. Days ago Harrild posted a photograph on Facebook, apparently taken inside his cell in which he bares his tattooed body, narrows his eyes and adopts a boxers stance. It is accompanied by the words: Feeling Optimistic, and in Spanish: Taste of freedom  it is coming soon.
On Facebook, Harrild calls himself Rocky Bal Bo, thought to be a reference to Rocky Balboa, the character Sylvester Stallone plays in the Rocky films.
At the prison last night scores of people waited outside the stark 50ft high barbed-wired topped walls to visit inmates.
Harrild used to live in a 750-a-month apartment in Santiago, pictured, along with his wife Maria
Street vendors selling hotdogs set up stalls to feed women and children waiting in line under the winter sun to visit prisoners. Harrilds new home is a far cry from the 750-a-month apartment he and Maria shared in an immaculate white, doorman-guarded block in the upmarket, leafy residential suburb of La Reina, popular with expats.
Harrild is not thought to have had any visitors inside prison apart from his father and lawyers. But he did receive a consular visit from a British diplomat at the police station the day after his arrest.
He is due to appear in court again next week.
This week he had been scheduled to play with the Santiago Philharmonic in a production of Puccinis opera Madame Butterfly at the landmark Municipal Theatre of Santiago  Chiles oldest theatre  and his name appears in the programme among the other horn players. A colleague from the orchestra who declined to give his name said: Weve all been told not to comment.
A woman who answered the door at the Harrilds six-bedroom gated home in Dulwich said the family did not wish to comment.

	How the Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe got away with 23 'unsolved' murders

	In 1992 Peter Sutcliffe confessed to attacking two other victims during police interviews. Here, in an extract from Yorkshire Ripper: The Secret Murders, its authors ask why more was not done.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
The note also cites the catch-all health and safety, which under the Act means that the files contain information that could damage the physical or mental health of at least one person.
But there is another reason the Sutcliffe files remain locked in the vaults: the shameful cover-up that began in the months after his conviction.
A photofit produced by Tracy's description after she was attacked in 1975 (left) and an image produced after the attempted murder of one of the 'official' Ripper victims in 1977 (right)
Peter Sutcliffe was convicted in 1981 for murdering 13 women
The farcical proceedings at the Old Bailey  a fiasco that began with the Attorney General Sir Michael Havers first accepting Sutcliffes claims of insanity and then being forced to prove the precise opposite  ended on May 22, 1981. The same day, Colin Sampson, then assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire Police, began an internal inquiry into the failures of the Ripper inquiry. Simultaneously, Lawrence Byford, the local head of Her Majestys Inspectorate of Constabulary, began a separate investigation on the direct orders of Home Secretary William Whitelaw.
The parallel examinations were detailed and rigorous: Byfords team spent five months grilling senior detectives and junior officers alike. They were paid for by the public purse but both reports were kept secret, and some of their most important sections remain under lock and key today.
Sampson delivered his 200-page report to Chief Constable Ronald Gregory in October 1981. He concluded that if the force had not missed every clue that pointed to Sutcliffe, the deaths of his last six victims could have been prevented.
He blamed the forces chaotic filing system and the fact that Sutcliffe did not fit the profile drawn up after detectives wrongly became convinced that the Im Jack hoaxer (a man with a Sunderland accent who made a tape-recorded message and wrote taunting letters) was the real Yorkshire Ripper.
Faced with such a devastating condemnation, Gregory ordered the suppression of the report. But that wasnt the only reason. The key lay in two brief sections towards the end. We can reveal that one chapter, headed Other Similar Attacks, identified a number of similar unsolved attacks on local women dating back to 1966.
It said: Sutcliffe has now been interviewed about these and other cases which occurred elsewhere in the country, but has denied responsibility.
Killer's real face: The police mugshot of Peter Sutcliffe after he was finally arrested in 1981
This was an explosive revelation. After years of failing to link the Yorkshire Ripper to a succession of similar cases, West Yorkshire Police had now, apparently, rushed to ask Sutcliffe whether he would like to confess to them. Since detectives knew the Ripper confessed only to cases with which he had publicly been linked, the effort was  at best  naive.
Nor was the claim wholly truthful. In the months following Sutcliffes arrest, Detective Sergeant Desmond OBoyle had been pursuing a hunch on two unsolved local cases. The first was a brutal assault on taxi driver John Tomey, who had been attacked from behind with a ball-peen hammer in 1967. OBoyle spotted the similarity in modus operandi between the Tomey case and the proven Ripper attacks. He also noted that the detailed description Tomey had given closely matched Sutcliffe.
After interviewing Mr Tomey in the winter of 1981, the detective was convinced that he had uncovered another Ripper victim.
The other case was the unsolved murder of bookmaker Fred Craven in April 1966 in Bingley. He too had been bludgeoned from behind with a hammer. Again there was a good description of a man answering Sutcliffes description, and wearing a distinctive denim Donovan cap, as worn by the then famous Scottish pop singer. Sutcliffes 16-year-old brother Michael wore such a cap and was questioned for two days by police before being released.
Detectives failed to realise that another man at the same address was a better match: Peter Sutcliffe also owned a Donovan cap.
Immediately after Sutcliffes arrest in January 1981, Fred Cravens son, Ronald, rang the head of the Ripper Squad, George Oldfield, to ask whether his father could have been a victim. Oldfield had brusquely said he was too busy handling Sutcliffes confession to speak; he promised to call back  but never did.
OBoyle made a formal recommendation to his superiors that Sutcliffe should be interviewed about the Craven and Tomey cases.
His suggestion was rejected by Acting Assistant Chief Constable Jim Hobson, who insisted the Ripper only attacked women.
The second, potentially devastating, revelation in the Sampson Report was headed Description and Photofits of Suspects.
During the inquiry at least 77 photofit pictures and four artists impressions were compiled from descriptions given by witnesses and victims from a range of cases.
Here was evidence that the Ripper Squad had been given a large number of photofits from a succession of cases other than those for which Sutcliffe would be convicted. It begged the question of what had been done with them. We cannot know because they have never been released.

HE CONFESSED TO ATTACKING THIS GIRL... SO WHY DID DETECTIVES NOT ACT?
Tracy Browne was just 14 when she was bludgeoned from behind while walking to her parents Yorkshire farmhouse in 1975.
She survived to give police a remarkably accurate description of Peter Sutcliffe.
Had detectives linked that attack to the first two official Ripper attacks that had happened just weeks before, Sutcliffes reign of terror could have been brought to an end then  six years before he was eventually arrested in 1981.
Peter Sutcliffe admitted the attack  and confessed to another  from inside Broadmoor High Security Hospital in 1992, but was never prosecuted for them.

The remit for the Byford investigation was wider. His team was tasked with drawing up a series of recommendations for future major murder inquiries.
Initially Byford believed that his findings should be made public. But something (or someone) appears to have changed his mind. The report, he later wrote, would now only be shown to those with a need to know. He added: I am aware of the inherent dangers the release of material from the report would involve for the morale of the West Yorkshire force as well as for the Home Secretary. Byford sent his report to the Home Office, which promptly locked it away.
Even when a Freedom of Information request winkled the document out of Whitehall in 2006, the report would be heavily redacted.
What was it that Byford had found that demanded such protection? Tucked away in his conclusions, Byford warned the Home Secretary: There is a curious and unexplained lull of Sutcliffes criminal activities and there is the possibility that he carried out other attacks on prostitutes and unaccompanied women during that period we feel it is highly improbable that the crimes in respect of which Sutcliffe has been charged and convicted are the only ones attributed to him.
This feeling is reinforced by examining the details of a number of assaults on women since 1969 which, in some ways, clearly fall into the established pattern of Sutcliffes overall modus operandi.
Savage: Sutcliffe was only ever convicted for 13 murders
It is my firm conclusion that between 1969 and 1980 Sutcliffe was probably responsible for many attacks on women, which he has not admitted, not only in West Yorkshire and Manchester but also in other parts of the country.
Many attacks? Other parts of the country? Who were the victims?
In the wake of Sutcliffes failed appeal against his murder convictions in May 1982, police forces from across Britain queued up to interview the Ripper about unsolved attacks and killings in their areas.
Among them was Derbyshire Police which believed that Sutcliffe was the prime suspect for the murder of Barbara Mayo in October 1970.
She was a 24-year-old trainee teacher from London who disappeared while hitch-hiking up the M1 in 1970.
On October 18, six days after she was last seen, her body was discovered in woodland near Ault Hucknall, Derbyshire. She had been bludgeoned over the back of the head and garotted. DNA evidence, presumably semen, had been left at the scene.
All fit the MO of the Ripper, who regularly travelled to London at that time. True to form, West Yorkshire Police denied the Derbyshire force access to Sutcliffe.
While researching our book, we made a succession of FoI requests to police forces across the country, asked for access to Keith Hellawells list of 22 likely Ripper cases, and to the suppressed photofits identified by Colin Sampson and Lawrence Byford. We also asked the Home Office for access to the suppressed sections of the Byford Report.
In every case our requests were refused, usually on the grounds of confidentiality.
Whose privacy is being protected? The victims? Unlikely: in the murder cases, there remains no confidentiality to guard, and those who survived surely need justice and closure.
We came to a different conclusion. The evidence has been suppressed to spare the embarrassment so rightly predicted by Lawrence Byford of the various police forces and the Home Office.
But most of all, it has protected Peter Sutcliffe from answering for the full list of his grisly crimes.

        <Description>
	Zoe Appleyard-Ley's former nanny, 45-year-old Emma Currie, was jailed for stealing £900 from her after vanishing in her car with a loot of her most prized possessions.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>1 silver spoon
1 suitcase
I started to make a hurried inventory of what was missing. A friend drew my attention to the emptied coat cupboard and it turned out that not just obvious things had gone missing. Can you remember everything in your house and where you left it?
It was only when I saw what was in the car when I collected it from Crawley police station, with no ID to prove I was me, that I understood the full extent of what had been taken. Places we had not even thought to look for missing items had clearly been targeted too.
That sense of cruel violation is something I hope few people will ever experience. However, as with any bad event, you get over it for your own sake and also for the sake of your children. You retain your belief in justice and want them to understand that justice does exist so you do everything you can to help the police in their investigation and of course you accept youll have to be a witness for the CPS.
Currie then jumped bail and went on the run, failing to turn up for her first court hearing. When she was finally caught and brought before a jury, I soon realised that a criminal trial can be even more traumatic than the crime itself.
Possessions can be replaced, but when someone sets out to destroy you publicly you are blind-sided. I was shocked that she could be capable of such cruelty. Suddenly everything was at stake.
I did not discover until the trial that, when Currie was arrested in my car near Gatwick Airport with my passport beside her, she had immediately started lying to cover her tracks. I was astounded to find out that the reason she gave for having been in Victoria Station was to deliver my dry cleaning to Jeeves of Belgravia. There is no Jeeves there and CCTV footage showed her without any dry cleaning.
Worse still, she exaggerated heinous lies she had told to social services in August 2013 and began to make up wild and unfounded allegations about me and my family. Until that moment, I had not realised that the British criminal justice system allowed criminals open season to ruin the lives of their victims by tarnishing their reputation and smearing their character without any effective right of reply.
If criminals are so inclined, they can stop at nothing, they can say anything they want. In court there are no holds barred. The oath to them means nothing. It does not matter that innocent and already violated children will be traumatised still further.
The things I was accused of were, to say the least, colourful.
As soon as I was called to the witness box, I realised that I was defenceless. I had no legal representation or say in what had been presented to the jury.
I was to answer only the questions I was asked and was unable even to whisper to friends the full facts. I had no forum in the witness box to state what really happened for fear of being held in contempt of court.
It did not seem to matter that Westminster Social Services had investigated Curries evil allegations and judged them to be false and malicious, or that their report was at the disposal of the prosecutor and had been submitted to the defence counsel from the outset  which, begrudgingly, she had to admit to the judge at the end of the trial.
Betrayed: Mrs Appleyard-Ley wants to share her experience in the hope of informing other parents
No one elects to be a victim of crime. You have no choice if you are summoned to appear as a witness for the CPS. But as a witness, your interests are not necessarily aligned with those of the CPS. It is not their job to defend you.
Indeed, collateral damage to the victim is of no interest to the CPS, even if they are hurt far more viciously in the pursuit of justice than in the original crime. Indeed, you do not actually realise that the prosecutor may have only been given the case that morning, and can even dismiss key witnesses not knowing what else they could independently verify.
THE 12 LESSONS I LEARNED...THE HARD WAY
1. Do rigorous background checks and insist on speaking to all previous employers.
2. Install video cameras in your house
3. Keep a credit card hidden, so you can get cash if your purse is stolen.
4. Be prepared for further violations upon your reputation in court, even if they are lies.
5. Make copious notes and put everything you can possibly think of in police statements. Keep copies.
6. Ask anyone who can corroborate your version of events to write detailed notes that include your reactions and make sure the police take statements.
7. Re-live the days before, during and immediately after the crime; think of everything, speak to people who were around you  they might remember something you dont.
8. Be prepared to be in shock at being in the same room as the criminal  I left the Old Bailey crying.
9. You will realise who your absolute best friends are
10. Try to keep your trauma away from your children
11. If you can, read out your Victim Impact Statement yourself. It will help in getting any restraining orders you might rightfully deserve.
12. It really is now time to move on and never mention this womans name again
Meanwhile the defence counsel will have been working in close collaboration with the criminal for weeks or even months.
I understand Currie went through three legal teams in two years. Unlike the criminal, the victim has been given no briefing or training for how to deal with the witness box experience (its awful), or expectation of what they may face in cross examination  however irrelevant to the charges under consideration.
Your inquisitors come across as cool and collected, you can look like a car-wreck.
Even worse, anything you may have said or done in your life may be twisted and used against you while the track record and previous bad character of the criminal must apparently be withheld from the jury  even if that includes, as it did in Curries case, jumping bail, going on the run from the police and apparently even performing a remarkably similar theft on a vulnerable elderly lady taking her car, heirlooms, silver and her beloved pet dog.
Until I appeared as a witness, I had never realised that victims of crime and witnesses are often treated worse in our courts than the criminals themselves.
The rules must be changed to stop criminals like Currie further abusing their victims while the court stands silent, as they do so. I have also come to believe that victims and witnesses should be given anonymity in cases where their private home and children are involved. At the very least, reporting restrictions should apply.
I hope my story will not discourage anyone from employing people to help them at home. Its often a matter of necessity, rather than choice. There must be thousands of people with small children or aged relatives who thank God daily for the help they receive from carers, house-helps, baby-sitters and nannies. For them, a world where you never let another person inside your home is not realistic.
However, my ordeal is a wake-up call that you need to be very careful about whom you place your trust in. Leave no stone unturned in your background checks. You need to know everything to make a proper evaluation of the risk.
And in my opinion the DBS check is not worth the paper it is written on (unless, of course, it actually shows a criminal conviction). Most thefts end up as a crime reference number, not a prosecution.
At one stage Curries barrister tried to get her a suspended sentence by blaming me for placing an inappropriate level of trust in her.
Until Emma-Jane Currie was finally convicted, I was in many ways the accused.

	Barrowford Primary bans teachers from raising their voices

	New-Age-style Barrowford Primary School in Lancashire, pictured,  has no rules at all and instead of play time, the teachers and pupils negotiate an appropriate period to take a break and eat lunch.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

But it can be revealed today that Barrowford has an even more unusual approach to discipline. Unlike most schools, there is no behaviour policy, no lists of rules on the walls and, for the past four years, no sanctions at all.
Instead is unconditional positive regard  a term coined by American psychologist Carl Rogers which means accepting people as they are without judging them. Children have emotional literacy lessons where they are taught that there are no negative or positive emotions, just feelings to be acknowledged and understood.
School policy states: A child is not to be defined as naughty. It should be explained to the child that they have made a wrong choice.
Mrs Tomlinson admits that conflicts do arise but her staff are not allowed to shout at those involved. Teachers do not raise their voices as it is not respectful, but instead might point out that talking during a lesson has an impact on my emotional well-being.
No punishment: Headteacher Rachel Tomlinson says it is important that children see themselves as intrinsically good and build up a positive sense of self
See what life is like at 'inspirational school' Barrowford
They can ask children to go to another class, but to avoid causing any humiliation they are told to use the phrase: You know I think you are wonderful but your mistaken behaviour shows me that at this moment in time it would be best for you to have some time here, where these children can help you to stop making that mistake.
Even if a child is harmed, there is no punishment, but a restorative conferences designed to heal the damaged relationship.
Discipline is not the only unusual policy at the school. In 2012 it broke with the tradition of having playtime and lunch at fixed times. Instead the pupils and staff decide among themselves when to take a break. And in some weeks pupils are given hot chocolate and bacon butties for breakfast as part of Mrs Tomlinsons drive to create a comfortable environment.
The schools logo is a B designed to look like a heart and its slogan is learn to love, love to learn. They have a nurture room for pupils who cant sit in normal classes where instead they are helped to manage their feelings and cope better with school in whats described as a lovely environment.
No pupils have been suspended or expelled from Barrowford in the seven years that Mrs Tomlinson has been in charge, and it now takes on children who have been excluded from other schools.
She admits some parents struggled with the concepts at first, but says they are now supportive. In 2012, Ofsted rated the school good but noted that bullying is not dealt with effectively and some children get distracted when teachers do not provide the correct level of challenge for all pupils, issues Mrs Tomlinson insists have been tackled.
Last night Chris McGovern, a long-serving teacher and Ofsted inspector who runs the Campaign for Real Education, said: They are well intentioned but misguided  its a recipe for chaos.
Children need boundaries, they prefer clarity and they want to see punishment for the bullies.

	More than 350 former MPs still have passes to the Palace of Westminster

	Included in the group of 356 ex-politicians given a  Former Members' Pass are disgraced former MPs who have been involved in sex and expenses scandals and over a dozen who lost at the General Election.

Documents obtained by the Mail on Sunday under Freedom of Information laws show that 356 ex-politicians have obtained a Former Members Pass. It means they can entertain family guests in some of Westminsters bars and cafes which are closed to unescorted ordinary voters.
They include former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, still under investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog Kathryn Hudson over a cash-for-access sting which forced his suspension from the Labour Party in February.
Disgraced: Chris Huhne, pictured after winning his seat in 2010 before he was convicted of perverting the couse of justice in 2013, also owns a Former Members' Pass which allows him access to the Palace
An apprehensive Mr Huhne speaks ahead of prison sentence
Allowed: Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was also awarded a pass. He was suspended from Labour in February over the 'cash for access' scandal, and is still being investigated by a parliamentary watchdog
Another holder of the pass is former Tory minister Brooks Newmark. He quit the Commons this spring after sending an explicit photo of himself to an undercover reporter posing as a young female party activist.
Chris Huhne  who served a prison sentence in 2013 for perverting the course of justice  also holds a pass, as does former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith who was revealed in the 2009 expenses scandal to have billed taxpayers for the cost of two pay-per-view pornographic films watched by her husband.
The pass comes with strict instructions not to use it for lobbying on the premises and there is no suggestion any of the pass-holders have broken the rules.
But Edinburgh East MP Mr Sheppard said: As a new MP, I was genuinely surprised to see an awful lot of people that I thought had lost their seats wandering around and using the facilities.
It seems theres been a huge growth in the availability of these passes. There needs to be an inquiry into how this is managed and a procedure for former MPs to make a declaration of interests as current MPs have to do.

	Pre-wedding 'teatox' dieting craze using Bootea stops the Pill working

	Naomi Salt (pictured) unexpectedly fell pregnant after using the teatox. Herbal infusion Bootea can stop the Pill from working but angry users complained there was no warning on packaging.

Ms Salt said the online warning, which states that Bootea can affect the accuracy of the Pill if you take your pill in the morning within four hours of the laxative effect, is not prominent enough. She said: It is irresponsible, theyve got a duty of care to young women like myself. Bootea assumes people check the website but not everyone will.
Other women have taken to online forums to warn fellow dieters of the risk of becoming pregnant while taking Bootea, which is sold by Holland &amp; Barrett or direct online.
One woman wrote: At first it was great. I lost half a stone in two weeks! That great feeling didnt last long. Im now eight weeks pregnant with our third child, and after four weeks of shock it has finally sunk in and I have accepted this.
Another said: After having my little girl in 2014 I wanted to lose weight for the summer. I started Bootea and really liked it, I could see results and it tasted nice. Then I missed my period and thought it was strange as I was on the Pill. Now me and my hubby have a 13-month-old and Im two months pregnant.
No warning: People have complained the Bootea packaging carries no warning that the Pill will stop working
A third woman wrote: I had the same result! Dont get me wrong we are over the moon... But people should be made aware. Ive been on the Pill for almost 14 years! 28 days of Bootea... PREGNANT!
The programme involves drinking a herbal tea every morning with a separate infusion every other evening for 14 or 28 days. It is claimed that the teas will performed an intensive cleanse of the digestive system to help customers feel energised and motivated.
But the tea company, based in Cheshire, warns the bedtime cleanse may produce a laxative effect the following day.
Dr Sarah Hardman, deputy director of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare in London, said: The suggestion from the manufacturer is that the Pill is just being washed through your system too fast. You may not be absorbing your pill correctly and it may be the effectiveness of it is reduced.
The guidelines that come with the combined oral contraceptive pill say that if you have diarrhoea within four hours of taking it the effectiveness cannot be guaranteed, so you should be using additional precautions as well.
Ideally Bootea would mention this on the packaging, but if women are taking something that is not a prescribed medication then they have to take responsibility for looking at the potential risks.
Mail on Sunday health columnist Dr Ellie Cannon, agreed, saying: This is a failure of the counselling those women have had when they have been given the Pill rather than the failure of this tea.
Booteas online advice says that the tea can affect the accuracy of the Pill through its normal laxative properties  but that effects should NOT include diarrhoea.
The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

	Cyborgs in Channel 4's Humans get naked far less than those in Sweden

	A number of sexual encounters and nude scenes in Swedish Akta Manniskor, pictured, don't appear in the British version Humans as the makers don't want it to be sexually exploitative.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Watch the dark trailer for new Channel 4 drama Humans
Big hit: It's the channel's highest rating show since 1992 but, uncharacteristically, it tones down the sexual content compared to it's Swedish counterpart
Just a kiss: This is another raunchy scene from the Swedish version of the show in which a man and a female robot kiss passionately
The Swedish version features several sexual encounters between humans and machines which will not feature in the remake, while scenes featuring nudity have been toned down.
There is no nudity in the British version, co-writer Sam Vincent told The Mail on Sunday. We do not want to be perceived as being exploitative.
6 million Channel 4 viewers saw lustful human teenager Toby try to touch the breasts of robot synth Anita, played by Gemma Chan
Last week, 6 million Channel 4 viewers saw lustful human teenager Toby try to touch the breasts of robot synth Anita, played by Gemma Chan. But she stopped him, declaring it inappropriate. However, in the Swedish version, Anita allows him to rub her intimately. In another scene from the original, a male cyborg touches his female owners breasts over the breakfast table before the couple are shown making love. This too is absent from the British version. And in another moment cut from the UK remake, the Swedish Anita removes her top and examines her breasts in a mirror.
Vincent added: Because we go deeper into the examination of sexual exploitation in our show we had to be very careful we were not going to be exploitative ourselves. That is why we didnt want to have a lot of nudity.
The new sensitivity marks a change of tone for Channel 4, which once revelled in shocking audiences with risque content, leading its former chief executive Michael Grade to be dubbed Britains pornographer in chief.
But Humans is not entirely chaste. The Mail on Sunday can reveal that an upcoming episode will feature a sexual encounter between a human and a synth.
Producer Chris Fry said: Its beautifully handled and at no point is it gratuitous. We wanted to explore the question of whether doing something like that with a synthetic is the same as doing it with a human being.
Humans, which is Channel 4s biggest ratings drama success since The Camomile Lawn in 1992, continues tonight at 9pm.

A group of civilians stood and watched as the latest sickening murders took place.
One terrorist guarded the area standing on the back of a Toyota pickup truck armed with a heavy machine gun. 
However, despite the display of force by the terror group in their Raqqa stronghold, ISIS is being pushed back in areas such as Kobani, a vital border town between Syria and Turkey.
After they were murdered, the men were strung up on make-shift crosses along the roadside
Both men were dressed identically in red plastic protective suits when they were shot by the terrorists
U.S. and coalition forces have pounded 14 ISIS targets in Syria and a further seven in Iraq.
The terror group has been digging trenches around Raqqa as Kurdish forces close in on the strategically important town.
U.S. and coalition forces launched 14 air strikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and seven in Iraq on Friday, the U.S. military said, amid reports the militant group killed 145 civilians in the town of Kobani.
Four air strikes near Kobani, on the border with Turkey, hit three Islamic State tactical units and destroyed two boats, a fighting position and a vehicle, the Combined Joint Task Force said on Saturday.
Five air strikes near the militant stronghold of Raqqa destroyed five excavators, a vehicle and a remotely piloted aircraft. The task force said other strikes in Syria hit near Aleppo, Tal Abyad and Hasaka, where the militant group pressed a separate assault on Friday to capture government-held parts of the city.
In Iraq, the air strikes targeted militants near five cities: Baghdadi, Al Huwayjah, Baiji, Habbaniyah and Tal Afar. They destroyed buildings, weapons and vehicles and hit Islamic State tactical units, the task force said in a statement.

Recovering: Joe Pugh was badly injured on The Smiler ride, but remains remarkably upbeat
Home for the first time since he was horrifically injured in the Alton Towers rollercoaster crash, teenager Joe Pugh, whose girlfriend lost a leg in the disaster, has revealed how the accident has brought the couple closer together.
Joe was on the front row of The Smiler ride with Leah Washington, 17, when it hit an empty carriage.
Leah has since had her left leg amputated above the knee. And last week it was revealed that 20-year-old dancer Vicky Balch, who was in the same carriage, has also lost a leg.
Both Joes knees were smashed in the June 2 crash and he faces months of physiotherapy. Yet speaking shortly after he had returned home, the textiles design student was remarkably upbeat.
He told The Mail on Sunday: Its amazing, but the accident really has brought the two of us even closer together.
We had mutual friends before, but in hospital her friends were coming to see me and mine would go and see her. Its become an ever-wider and closer circle of friends.
The young couple, who began dating in April, have been texting each other every day.
And last night I spoke to her on Facetime, beamed Joe, who is studying textile design at Huddersfield University.
Smitten: Joe's girlfriend Leah Washington has had to have her left leg amputated above the knee following the horror crash - but he revealed the pair are still together and the experience has brought them closer together
The 18-year-old was given a few minutes alone with Leah shortly before he left Royal Stoke University hospital on Monday. He had managed to see his girlfriend, who is still recovering from surgery, every day in hospital.
Last night, stretched out on the sofa at his bungalow home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, Joe recalled the precious moments he spent with her before boarding an ambulance for the journey back across the Pennines.
I just said to her: Take care, Ill see you soon. It was all over in a few moments, but it was emotional for both of us.
Was there a farewell kiss as father Simon, 51, and mother Julie, 50, hovered? Not in front of the parents! Joe replied.

Basic Instinct had just come out and I dont remember who the clever editor was in London, but they came up with sex addiction.
It became a new disease. No one had heard of that up until then, but its stuck with me ever since. And it still pops up now and again.
But he can smile about it now?
Oh yeah, my father is actually rather proud of it.
What, Meet my son, the sex addict?
Yes, just that! Dads a very funny guy, Douglas says of the 98-year-old Hollywood giant.
Hes witty. He has a new book of poetry out, some that he wrote and some poems that he loves, and the title is Life Could Be Verse.
Hes wonderful and he tells me hes proud of me. He didnt get a pat on the back from his father, so its lovely that hes able to tell me that.
Hes going to make it to his century, Im sure of that. It will be fantastic.
We had a little bump in the road. The problem in this business is that everything is so public. I love Catherine (Zeta-Jones) as much, more than I ever have. And hopefully the feelings mutual,' said Michael
It is hard to conceive that Michael Douglas, the fresh-faced love interest in TVs The Streets Of San Francisco, the pioneering young movie-maker who produced  and won an Oscar for  the ground-breaking One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest in 1975 (he was just 29 when production began on the film) will be 71 this year.
Its been quite a ride, he concedes with gentle understatement.
He is playfully proud of his impressive portfolio  a slew of modern mainstream hits including Wall Street, Fatal Attraction, Basic Instinct, Disclosure, Falling Down and The Game plus the highly respected Wonder Boys and Behind The Candelabra.
As an actor, Douglas has cornered the market in bad guys, effortlessly making on-screen evil both believable and unbelievably attractive.
In short, he is Satan in a suit. His latest devilish creation emerges in Beyond The Reach, an independent cat-and-mouse thriller.
Produced by and starring Douglas, he plays an unhinged corporate shark pursuing a shirtless British actor (Jeremy Irvine) across the Mojave desert in a tooled-up six-wheeled Mercedes.
Squinting unforgivingly throughout while deftly delivering drop-dead one-liners, Douglas is in his element. Its good to be bad, he says, palms innocently upturned.
Also due for release next month is the superhero live-action movie Ant-Man, based on the Marvel comic, in which Douglas portrays Dr Hank Pym, a scientist who has invented a substance that allows humans to change in size. It promises to be shape-shifting fun. Yet it is comforting to know that bad boys are still Douglass bread and butter.
You have a much broader range as an actor when you dont have to worry about being socially and morally responsible, he explains.
After Wall Street was released people who came up to me out of business school  usually half drunk  would say, Oh man, youre the reason I got into this. And Id say, But I went to jail in the movie  I committed a crime! But they didnt care, they loved the style. The devils charming, the devils beautifully dressed.
I think for all young actresses who are beautiful, age is not the most welcoming part. But shes (Catherine) very comfortable with it and I think shes comfortable with who she is. Shes still stunning looking,' said Michael
For todays meeting, Douglas is stylishly attired in a hand-made duck-egg-blue shirt, tailored charcoal trousers and sleek black Oxford shoes.
All my clothes come from movies, he shrugs modestly. Thats the good thing about making so many contemporary pictures. Nice new suits.
In person, Douglas is a softer proposition than the driven, sexually malevolent characters he brings to life with such ease on screen.
I dont consider myself a sex symbol, he grimaces. Ive done sexual films but I dont think of myself as a poster boy. Im not a Kate Upton.
This is true. Douglas bares scant resemblance to the blonde American swimwear model.
Sex, as opposed to murdering someone, he continues, is something everybody can relate to, so everybodys a judge with sex.
'Everyone does it, so its hard to pull it off in movies. Violence is a little easier as its not something all of us easily identify with.
Douglas says that he has experienced the horrors of gun-related violence, as has the world in the subsequent light of the Charleston church shootings, which occurred shortly after this interview was conducted.
Like Events own Piers Morgan, Douglas is a passionate campaigner for handgun control in the U.S.
His personal issue with guns began in 1980 when he inadvertently found himself at the scene of John Lennons murder in New York.
We walked by the apartment when it was happening, he says, chillingly.
I was with Jann Wenner, who owns Rolling Stone magazine; my own apartment was one block away. We didnt know what was going on but we saw the commotion, then heard what had happened later.
And despite the high-profile world that he inhabits, Douglas maintains that he has never kept a gun for his personal protection.
Would he ever own a handgun?
Tearful Michael Douglas thanks Catherine and kids at awards
Carys and her mum are very tight, very close and theyre both very good dancers. Dylan plays the guitar  hes really into Talking Heads. And he and I are both scuba divers,' said Michael (pictured earlier this month)
If I havent by now, then I probably wont, he says carefully. Ive had a couple of times when it was close... but theres too much chance of an accident happening. I think a lot of the time guns in the house can cause more trouble than its worth.
There are big, big differences between the UK and the United States  in a country of 320 million people, we basically have a gun for every man, woman and child out there.
I understand hunting, I understand target shooting  I dont understand a need for automatic weapons, I dont understand a need for armour-piercing bullets.
'We have a farm up in Canada and my son Dylans got a BB gun that he likes. And it was certainly a part of my growing up with cowboys and Indians and holsters and guns.
Douglas had his own confrontation with mortality when, after three mis-diagnoses, he was diagnosed with tongue cancer in 2010.
I was Stage 4 and Id seen a lot of other people that I know go, he says sadly. It was pretty bad... but it got better. Then it even got good.
Having completed seven weeks of chemo and radiation treatment like the seven circles of hell, Douglas set about getting Behind The Candelabra, his unflinching portrait of flamboyant pianist Liberace, off the ground.
But then both [co-star] Matt [Damon] and [director] Steven [Soderbergh] said, youve got to put this off for a year, Douglas remembers.
I was thinking, This isnt going to happen. Realistically, I was not ready. My weight was way down and they knew that from looking at me. They knew wed have to wait for me to get stronger. I was very touched.
From a point where you think you may never work again, or speak again, I got probably one of the best parts Ive ever had. It played a key part in this renaissance thats happened for me.
The film, a brilliant study of celebrity loneliness, won universal acclaim and a best actor Emmy, US TVs highest honour, for Douglas.
It also featured several physically intimate scenes with Matt Damon which, as straight men but consummate professionals, neither actor found especially taxing. Has Douglas, I enquire, ever had a gay experience in real life?
Is Simon Cowell a nice fellow? Im doing this talk show with him tonight and Cowells a good guy, right? Michael asks (pictured with Jame Corden and Cowell on The Late Late Show)
No, I mean Ive had... he begins, then pulls up, laughing. Thats a personal question.
But an interesting one for a heterosexual sex symbol to answer. He nods, peering inscrutably into the middle distance.
I cant say I have, he says slowly. Certainly when youre really young  14, 15  there are situations you become aware of in terms of people making moves or something but... no.
He returns to Behind The Candelabras complex main character. Was Douglas happy with his portrayal of Liberace?
I was just happy to be alive, he says, shaking his head now. I was ecstatic. It feels like a rebirth after you go through cancer and you come out of it. You feel like youre a child.
'You see priorities differently. You have a much deeper appreciation of marriage, of your children  you see everything a little bit clearer, and a little brighter.
In a newspaper interview Douglas gave in 2013, there appeared to be some confusion as to how the actor had contracted the disease and  more bizarrely  his apparent claim that tongue cancer could be cured by giving oral sex to women.
What I was trying to say was that there is a sexually transmitted virus called HPC, Douglas says, in an attempt to clarify the controversy that ensued.
But there is a vaccination that they recommend to all kids before they become sexually active so they dont catch HPC, which is a cause of certain types of cancer  cervical cancer, tongue and throat.
So he didnt imply that performing oral sex could cure certain types of cancer?
No, he groans, anguished by the notion. I was trying to make a public service comment.
And presumably it caused a certain discomfort over the Douglas breakfast table. A telling flash of pain flickers across his features.
It was one of those things... and I so regretted any embarrassment that it caused Catherine, he winces, before adding: And her family.
Unrelated to this specific incident, Douglas and Zeta-Jones split temporarily in 2013, the stress of Douglass illness having been a factor in their separation.
Ill be quite frank, said Zeta-Jones speaking a year ago about her husbands condition and its effect on her. I was a mess.
In Beyond The Reach, produced by and starring Michael, he plays an unhinged corporate shark pursuing a shirtless British actor (Jeremy Irvine) across the Mojave desert in a tooled-up six-wheeled Mercedes
'It's good to be bad': Michael Douglas on playing villains
I tell Douglas that the couples recent reunion has been all over the media in the past few days. He contemptuously repeats the phrase all over the media in a mildly murderous, thoroughly Michael Douglas fashion.
But he quietly confirms that the couple are together again and singing, as the Welsh like to do, from the same hymn sheet.
We had a little bump in the road, he discloses, diplomatically. The problem in this business is that everything is so public.
I love Catherine as much, more than I ever have. And hopefully the feelings mutual.
'We worked things out  if both people want to work something out and make it better, you can do it. You cant do it if its just one person.
Pushed as to what he means by this, Douglas attempts to explain, then stops himself, aware that he may be creating a whole new breakfast table issue.
Look, he intones firmly, were about to have our 15th wedding anniversary and it feels great.
I ask Douglas if Zeta-Jones also felt professional pressure? Had age discrimination started to affect her as she went up for roles?
I think for all young actresses who are beautiful, age is not the most welcoming part, Douglas replies thoughtfully.
But shes very comfortable with it and I think shes comfortable with who she is. Shes still stunning looking.
Contradicting rumours of an ongoing rift in the relationship, Douglas speaks with deep affection about his wife  they share a birthday on September 25, albeit a quarter of a century apart  and talks warmly about her homeland.
Ive been to The Mumbles a number of times, he says. The Gower Peninsula is one of the most beautiful places Ive seen.
'They have a fair amount of rain  they could probably import that to California around now. But its a great community and I love playing golf over there. I cant do the accent, he apologises.
My wife laughs me off the planet when I try.
On Behind The Candelabra: From a point where you think you may never work again, or speak again, I got probably one of the best parts Ive ever had. It played a key part in this renaissance thats happened for me'
A unifying factor in their partnership has been the fact that Douglas and Zeta-Jones dote on their two young children, Dylan, 14, and Carys, 12.
And Douglas is uncharacteristically gushing in his praise for their emerging talents.
Carys and her mum are very tight, very close and theyre both very good dancers, he reports proudly.
I take Carys to dance and I take her to Broadway shows  thats something we share together.
'Dylan plays the guitar  hes really into Talking Heads. And he and I are both scuba divers, we just came back from Costa Rica. He went down a hundred feet  hes so good at it  and its just magical down there.
Life for Douglass eldest son Cameron, 36, whose mother Diandra Luker divorced Douglas in 2000, has been less enchanting.
Jailed for five years in 2010 on methamphetamine and cocaine dealing charges, he has had a traumatic time inside.
In 2012 Camerons leg was broken by another inmate and he has since committed drug infractions which have led to spells in solitary and an extended sentence. He may not be released till 2018.
I visit him and... Douglas takes a deep breath, hes holding up, for a guy who really got screwed.
Reverse celebrity, making an example, its been a nightmare. Hes been in much longer than he should be, but hopefully it will come to an end soon.
Its very hard but it has been an education and I look forward to jumping into this issue once I can get him out.
Has the experience coloured his ideas about inherited wealth? Will Douglas leave his children the $300 million he is said to be worth, or instead let them fend for themselves financially?
Considering how successful Ive been and the lifestyle that my children have had, it would be irresponsible of me to leave them with nothing, he asserts.
But were not into that European thing of all the money gets passed down to the oldest male.
And what does Douglas like to spend money on when in more selfish mode?
Hes wonderful and he tells me hes proud of me. He didnt get a pat on the back from his father, so its lovely that hes able to tell me that,' said Michael of his father Kirk (pictured in 1953)
I have a hot rod or two, he says. I was in the hot rod club when I was a kid. Thats something Jeff Beck and I have in common. Hes got a beautiful American hot rod collection in the UK  hes a real enthusiast and, oh my God, what a guitar player he is.
Remaining on a musical note, Douglas then segues seamlessly into a delightful showbusiness story  and one previously unaired outside of his immediate circle.
I was in the Bel Air Hotel on my way to the Golden Globes, he begins promisingly.
And there was George Harrison in the lobby. I was a huge fan so I went over and talked to him a little then went off to the awards. And I won, for Wall Street.
I got back to the hotel and everyone had gone. There was no one to celebrate with so I was feeling a little sorry for myself but I thought, Screw this and I ordered a bottle of champagne and a lot  a lot  of caviar.
Then at around 12.30am the phone rings and its [unspeakably poor Liverpudlian accent] Michael, this is George. Me and me mate have just got back and we wondered if we could come over and say hello?
Then theres a knock on my door and in comes George Harrison and behind him is... Bob Dylan. And he has with him the biggest dog I have ever seen in my life, a huge beast.
Dylan sits down but he doesnt say anything, so George and I are talking and the dog starts walking back and forth and then he spots the caviar and goes over to it and  slurp, slurp  he starts licking at the tin, shovelling it in, probably 200 bucks a lick.
Im thinking, Its Bob Dylans dog  Im not going to say anything.
'Finally, Dylan leans forward and he says [affects dazed drawl], Far out, he loves caviar. Im like  panicking, calculating the cost  Yeah, yeah, he sure loves caviar, Bob.
Douglas, who is a contemporary and devoted fan of Dylans, freely confesses to having been a hippie.
Kirk weightlifts his sons Joel (left) and Michael in 1955.Hes going to make it to his century, Im sure of that. It will be fantastic,' he said of the 98-year-old Hollywood giant
He lived the tie-dye dream in a commune known as Banana Road in Santa Barbara, where he grew his hair, rode a motorcycle and let his love flow like a mountain stream.
Banana Road was wonderful, he recalls mistily. One of the best choices I made was going to college in California in the early Sixties. I was still going to school, barely, but I was keeping out of Vietnam.
We used to have wine stomps and Dionysian festivals where wed wear sheets and do Greek comedy. Wed take the tubes from paper towels and make phalluses.
There must have been a lot of marijuana around.
Pot was certainly there, he deadpans knowingly. I dont think its ever gone away.
Despite his previous stint in rehab, Douglas still allows himself alcohol occasionally.
Oh, I drink in moderation, he says, flapping a hand dismissively.I dont get drunk, I monitor myself pretty well.
Before he heads off to The Late Late Show studio for a sobering encounter with James Cordens white thighs, Michael Douglas considers his own most gratifying achievements.
Professionally, the batting average over my entire career isnt bad. There have been a few good movies in each decade. Not too many clunkers.
Personally, I like to think that Im a good father, trying to be a good husband... He exhales softly before drifting into a more cosmic zone: a star contemplating the stars.
When you look up to the sky at night youd think we would be a little kinder to each other, Douglas says, his famous face folding into a rueful smile.
Because I havent heard of any other planet we can live on.
Beyond The Reach is out on July 31

Six of the Hollywood legends best movies... in his own words
1. One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest (1975)
I was 29 when I produced that picture. That was just the dream of all dreams. We did a lot of crazy things: like shoot it in a real mental hospital

2. Wall Street (1987)
Am I underrated as an actor? Well, I got an Oscar for acting in Wall Street, so I guess I cant say Im underrated

3. Fatal Attraction (1987)
In Fatal Attraction I have this affair with Glenn Close and then I get back to my apartment and I rumple all the sheets up to make it look like I slept in my bed and the audiences laughed. The producer Sherry Lansing said, My God, I cant believe it, theyve forgiven you already'

4. Basic Instinct (1992)
Sharon Stone was fabulous in that movie. Shes great. Did that scene steal the picture? Thats not something that would bother me. It was a very successful film

5. Falling Down (1993)
I love those quirky pictures with a sort of nervous laughter in them. I liked the character I played in Falling Down very much

6. Wonder Boys (2000)
I dont think it got the credit it deserved for everyone involved  it was a great movie

	Terrified families were flown home from Tunisia yesterday in one of the biggest airlifts ever organised by British tour companies, after a deadly attack on a beach in Sousse left 38 dead.

'It's the first time I've ever been on holiday and feared for my life,' he said.
As one of the first planes landed at Gatwick, Peter Long, joint chief executive of Tui Group, which runs Thomson and First Choice, said that he was 'deeply, deeply shocked' by the atrocity.
He added: 'Our whole organisation is reeling with pain to see the suffering that has taken place in Tunisia.
'The tragedy of the situation continues as we see families who have lost loved ones. Our heartfelt feelings go out towards them.'
British holidaymakers are making their way home from Tunisia
Embrace: Tourists console each other following a shooting attack which left at least 38 tourists dead
Heading home: Return: Today thousands of British people were repatriated, with airlines offering them free flights home after a terrifying ordeal in Tunisia
Saddened: A female passenger, who is believed to be British, holds her head in her hands as the bus takes distraught tourists to the airport
Two holidaymakers embrace as they board a coach to take them home following the attacks in Tunisia
Tens off thousands of Britons are being airlifted back home, as thousands more have cancelled their holidays
Protection: As armed guards keep an eye on the leaving buses, Tunisia's Prime Minister announced a series of new security measures including closing renegade mosques
Bereavement counsellors and trauma teams have been sent to Sousse to assist relatives of the dead and injured, the company said.
Yesterday Thomson and First Choice predicted they still had around 5,400 customers in the country.
Flights were landing throughout the day at Manchester, Gatwick, East Midlands, Leeds-Bradford and Doncaster airports.
But some holidaymakers almost missed the evacuation, unaware of the airlift until they saw other guests with suitcases in the hotel lobby.
Mr Long said: 'We had situations where people locked themselves in their rooms because they were so scared, which is understandable.'
A number of tourists were so worried about the possibility of another attack that they asked Tunisian police to accompany them to the airport.
A team of holiday reps was on hand to greet passengers as they entered the arrivals hall at Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 yesterday on the first flights from Enfidha, about 35 miles from Sousse.
Some were clearly distressed as they were led away by staff, with one middle-aged woman in tears.
Eye witnesses recount horror of Tunisia beach attack
Massacre: Staff mop up the blood outside the Imperial Marhaba Hotel in Sousse, Tunisia, where at least 38 people were gunned down at a nearby beach in a terrorist attack yesterday

Tears: A woman weeps as she lays flowers where fellow holidaymakers were murdered yesterday
Memorial: One of the heartbreaking notes left at the scene reads: 'Terrorism will not win'
The terrorist attack happened in the popular holiday destination of Sousse in the north of Tunisia

Two ambulances waited outside the airport and a chaplain was on hand to comfort the returning families. Thomson and First Choice said all trips to Tunisia for the next week would be cancelled.
Another large tour company, Thomas Cook, said it was offering customers due to travel to Tunisia before July 5 the opportunity to cancel or change their holiday free of charge.
It sent two extra flights to the country yesterday, adding: 'We are committed to doing everything we can to support our customers who want to depart.'
Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, which has cancelled all flights and holidays to the region until July 5, added: 'Our absolute priority is to ensure the safe passage home of those customers wishing to travel as soon as possible.
'Aircraft are arriving now in Tunisia and will depart this evening.Passengers can rest assured that, as required, we will provide onward transport from Leeds Bradford and Manchester Airports.'
ABTA said there were an estimated 20,000 British package holidaymakers currently in Tunisia, plus an unknown number of independent travellers.
A spokesman said: 'The first priority is the welfare of holidaymakers in the hotels affected by this terrible incident, and extra flights have been put on to help people return home.'
Contemplative: Tourists sit at the terrace of the Imperiale Marhaba hotel after a gunman opened fire at the beachside hotel in Sousse
Embrace: Scared tourists comfort one another at the Imperial Marhaba Hotel having survived the terrifying gun attack outside the beachside hotel
Hospital: Injured people are treated near the area where an attack took place in Sousse
Bloodied: Emergency workers rushed to get the injured people to a hospital
Medics help an injured man in Sousse after gunmen stormed beaches of two hotels in the town of Sousse
Sousse terror attack: Wounded arrive at private clinic
It said holidaymakers elsewhere in Tunisia should contact their tour operator and follow any instructions issued by local authorities.
Meanwhile easyJet said it would provide an additional flight from Monastir, Tunisia, for customers wishing to fly home early.
Nearly 430,000 Britons visited Tunisia last year, according to ABTA.
The country's tourism chief, Hamda Abdelaoui, said the massacre was a 'catastrophe' for the industry and would lead to at least 1,000 Tunisians losing their jobs.
Last night it emerged that four UK emergency flights had taken off from Tunisia without any passengers on board, indicating that some visitors had decided to stay on after the attack.

A video taken inside the park shows hundreds of people dancing as loud music is played.
But the crowd's shouts of joy suddenly become screams of terror as the powder sprayed over the crowds bursts into flames.
Panic: Shocking footage of the accident shows chaotic scenes as victims try to escape from the flames while screaming in agony
Victims: Friends were seen comforting people severely burned in the fire at the Taiwanese amusement park
Terrifying: More than 200 people were taken to hospital after the blaze, with 80 in a serious condition
Crowded: It is believed that 1,000 people were inside the amusement park when the powder caught fire
Injured: Victims were carried out on inflatables at the water park by friends who managed to escape the blaze
Hurt: A man carries an injured woman away from the scene of the explosion at the water park in Taiwan
Agony: A victim grimaces as she is treated for burns outside the Formosa Water Park in New Taipei City

It took just seconds for the fire to spread through the throngs of revellers, with dozens seen running for their lives through the huge blaze.
Friends can be seen tripping over each other as they try to escape while the music and lights show continues.
Rescue workers and bystanders carried burned and injured people on their backs, in inflatables and on stretchers to get medical treatment.
One male witness told local news channel CTI: 'It started on the left side of the stage. At the beginning I thought it was part of the special effects of the party but then I realised there was something wrong and people started screaming and running.'

New Taipei City fire department said 205 people were injured, with 81 suffering serious burns. Some suffered burns to more than 40 per cent of their bodies.
A spokesman said: 'Our initial understanding is this explosion and fire... was caused by the powder spray. It could have been due to the heat of the lights on the stage.'
The fire at the Formosa Water Park near the island's capital was quickly brought under control, according to local reports.
Mayor of New Taipei Eric Chu said: 'We feel sad and regretful about the accident.
'I've ordered the park to shut down immediately and be placed under a rigorous investigation.'

	In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill Hudson, veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to ‘break all ties’ with his eldest children.

The post went viral, spawning thousands of comments as social media seethed with debate about absent fathers and whether being a biological father automatically earns a man the right to be called dad.
Almost Famous actress Kate twisted the knife further by posting an intimate black and white photograph of herself alongside Goldies long-term love Kurt Russell saying: Pa, just simply... thank you. Happy Fathers Day. I love you to the moon and back.
The offending tweet: Oliver Hudson posted this picture of his father Bill, and sister Kate on Father's Day

And as if to rub salt into Bills wounds, Oliver, too, posted a picture of himself with Kurt, adding the words: Happy Fathers Day, Pa.
For Bill, the anguish slowly turned to anger as the headlines raged and his phone rang off the hook.
But he has maintained a dignified silence  until now.
In a searingly raw interview with The Mail on Sunday last night, Bill, veering between tears of sadness and flashes of anger, vowed to break all ties with his eldest children.
I say to them now, I set you free, he pronounced, his voice breaking. I had five birth children but I now consider myself a father of three. I no longer recognise Oliver and Kate as my own.
I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name. They are no longer a part of my life. Olivers Instagram post was a malicious, vicious, premeditated attack. He is dead to me now. As is Kate. I am mourning their loss even though they are still walking this earth.

It is a sad denouement to a decades-long family saga which, Bill says, is more messed up and sad than any Hollywood screenplay could ever be.
For years, Bill and former wife Goldie have bickered publicly about Goldies claims that he all but abandoned the two famous siblings.
Last night, in a blistering attack on Goldie, Tinseltowns favourite ditzy blonde, Bill accused her of wilfully alienating him from their two children.
At the heart of the matter is what Bill calls the Hollywoodisation of Goldies story.
When we split up, she never had a bad word to say about me, he says. But when Kurt came on the scene, the narrative changed and I became the big, bad wolf. I would say to her Goldie, why are you trashing me and saying Im an absent father when its simply not the case? and shed laugh and go Oh Bill, you know it makes for a better story.
Eventually, Bill says, the fiction became fact as first Kate, now 36, and then Oliver, 38, drifted away from him and rejected his repeated pleas to remain part of their lives. He lays the blame at Goldies door. I believe the drip, drip, drip of poison which started when they were kids finally took hold, he says. Goldie wanted to create this myth of a perfect family with Kurt and she wanted me out.

Things came to a final showdown a week ago with Olivers bitter post.
That was like a dagger to the heart, says Bill as he sits in the sun-dappled courtyard of a hotel near his ranch home in Malibu, California. Its time for the truth to come out.
At 65, Bill still has the rugged good looks and easy charm that captivated Goldie when she was at the height of her fame. During their marriage, she became the highest-paid female star in the world thanks to quirky comedies such as Shampoo, Theres A Girl In My Soup and Private Benjamin. When the pair met in the first-class cabin of a New York to LA flight in 1975, Bill was a successful star in his own right with his group The Hudson Brothers, (the One Direction of our day, he quips). He had his own TV show and performed alongside The Beach Boys, The Osmonds and The Monkees.
The attraction was instant. I invited her out to dinner that night and that was it. The sex was mind-blowing. Even when everything else in the relationship turned sour, the sex was always amazing.
The pair wed in 1976 when Goldie was already pregnant with Oliver.
When their son was born at LAs Cedars-Sinai hospital, Oliver suffered from the life-threatening condition meconium aspiration, when a newborn accidentally inhales contaminated amniotic fluid.
Oliver was in isolation for three days, says Bill. Goldie and I were beside ourselves. She was really sick and Id go from her bedside to the neonatal intensive care unit. The doctors didnt think Oliver would make it. I was only 26 and in a state of shock.
Goldie and I were sobbing but Oliver pulled through and from that moment he was our precious miracle.
He was my first-born. I adored that child. When Kate came along, I loved her with all my heart, too. There was this deep love among the four of us for years. And thats what makes it so difficult to say goodbye.

Bill says clouds formed in the relationship over his wifes free spirit and desire for an open relationship.
Goldie was having affairs. She told me pretty much on our wedding night she wanted an open marriage, that she couldnt imagine being faithful to one man for the rest of her life.
When Goldie made a film, Cactus Flower, in London, her mother Laura moved into the marital home  a magnificent 10 million beachside villa in Malibu  and helped Bill care for the children.
Oliver was three and Kate four months old. Goldie went to Europe for a month. I stayed home on Daddy duty. I later found out shed been sleeping with one of her co-stars, French actor Yves Rnier.
I wanted a traditional marriage but Goldie couldnt settle. Eventually I moved out.
The marriage ended in 1981. Bill went on to have a long-term relationship with Love Story actress Ali MacGraw, before marrying Cindy Williams, star of TV comedy Laverne &amp; Shirley. They had two children Emily, now 31, and Zachary, 28, before that marriage also ended in divorce.

His youngest child is Lalania, nine, from a long-term relationship with a woman to whom he remains exceptionally close.
Meanwhile, Goldie met Kurt Russell in 1983. And while the pair have never married, their relationship is considered one of the happiest in Hollywood. When we first split up, I took a house on the beach in Malibu to stay close to the kids, says Bill. I was a part of their lives for years. Kate and Oliver came over at weekends, there were family holidays.
In fact, the photograph that Oliver posted on Instagram was taken by Cindy while we were on holiday in Florida. Goldie wanted a vacation with Kurt because theyd just got together and so Cindy and I took the kids to DisneyWorld. Everything was cool.
But he says Goldie used her increasing fame and financial superiority to freeze him out.
I call it parental alienation. We had a custody arrangement but Goldie constantly flouted it. Id turn up to see the kids and would discover Goldie had taken them on the private jet to her home in Colorado.
'She gave interviews about her wonderful relationship with Kurt and how the kids called him Pa. She described me as an absent father. Id call her and go Goldie, how can you say that? but shed just reply: Its a better story. 
As Kates fame grew she, too, accused her father of being an absentee dad: There was never a birthday card, she complained, to which Bill responds: Rubbish! I sent birthday cards every year.
I ring her up every birthday, still do. The same with Oliver. I bumped into Oliver fairly recently in a supermarket in Malibu and he gave me a hug. I always thought Oliver could be the peacemaker, that somehow he would help bring our fractured family back together.

Goldie poisoned them against me. She told the kids Id moved to Portland. I did go to Portland for eight months to make an album but then I came back to LA. I never abandoned my family. I never walked away. I wanted to be a father to Kate and Oliver but Goldie made it harder and harder for me to see them. Its all about control. What Goldie wants, Goldie gets.
He recalled going to mediation during their custody battle. Goldie grabbed my forearm as we were leaving and said to me: Its all about the money and power, babe.
When Oliver and Kate were in their early teens, Bill decided to end the court battles and told the children his door was always open to them. Oliver would come and stay with me. Wed go fishing, have sleep-overs. But Kate drifted away.
The pair enjoyed an uneasy rapprochement when Kate started dating Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson, father of her elder son Ryder, 11. She also has a three-year-old son Bingham with British rocker Matt Bellamy, from whom she split last year after four years.
At one point, I was writing a letter to my children every week for a year. Did those letters ever get to them? Who knows? When I read some of the comments on social media, it was so hurtful. People believe the bull****. Well, Im here to say its just not true. At first, Bill picks his words carefully over Kates Fathers Day photo of herself with Kurt. It was an intimate shot and, as her father, I found it inappropriate and unsettling. Ill leave it at that, he says.

Then, angrily, he adds: She wants to be Kurts daughter? Well then, take his name, stop using mine.
He has removed photographs of Kate and Oliver from his home and even thrown away their knitted baby booties which I carried in the glove compartment of every car Ive ever owned for good luck.
Last week, Oliver posted a reply to one fan in which he was unrepentant, emphasising his closeness to Kurt Russell: What started out as what I thought as a joke has turned into something more. And I embrace that. Ive done and continue to do a lot of work on myself to better understand what make me tick. Yes, science links us but love binds us. OH + KR = 
Bill is clearly still deeply wounded. He says: Oliver could have picked up the phone and called me but he hasnt. What shocks me is that this was clearly premeditated. He chose the photograph and posted it on Fathers Day, when he knew it would cause maximum pain. Oliver has lived in the shadow of his mother and sister all his life. Maybe he wanted to be in the headlines?
If what he wanted was me out of their lives, then hes succeeded. I dont want to see either of my eldest children ever again. Its over.
Goldie Hawn, Kate and Oliver Hudson did not comment last night.

        <MainBody>Soccer-mad Tracey is really on the ball
Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has installed a full-size Subbuteo football pitch in her Whitehall office.
The two teams are Englands 1966 World Cup winners and their West German opponents.
Sports Minister Tracey Crouch has installed a full-size Subbuteo football pitch in her Whitehall office
Crouch is a talented footballer who coaches a schoolgirls team.
Dog hears that acronym-obsessed mandarins cheekily refer to her (behind her back) as BILT thats Bend It Like Tracey.

Plebgate MP Andrew Mitchell has asked Dog to correct our report last week of Tory tycoon Michael Spencers 400,000 bacchanalian bash in Marrakech.
At Mitchs request, we are delighted to point out that fellow Conservative grandee Francis Maude did not parade round the hotel pool in an Arabic style jalabiya, or dishdash robe, looking like a twerp. Maude was in shorts.
No, the partying Tory in the dishdash was Mitchell. Glad to put the record straight.

'Worthless' wannabes
One of, if not the, most venerated of Labours elder statesmen MPs (no more clues) says he will refuse to vote for any of the partys four leadership contenders because they are all useless.
He confided in Dog: Burnhams burnt out, Yvette [Cooper]s wet, Kendalls worth sod-all and Corbyns a clown. We have only ever had two real winners in over a century  Tony Blair and Harold Wilson. None of this lot can hold a candle to them.
A senior Labour figure says all the party's leadership candidates are 'useless', including favourites Andy Burnham (left) and Yvette Cooper (right)

Lib Dem Adrian Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat in the election when his party was reduced to a rump of just eight MPs, refuses to throw in the towel.
Asked if he now felt powerless, Sanders said: No I dont  Castro invaded Cuba with just seven men. Is he Havana laugh?

Justice Secretary Michael Gove will rue the day he lectured mandarins on grammar.
Last week, he congratulated Scots Nat MP Kirsty Blackman on having been educated at Aberdeens Robert Gordons College, the same school as me.
Write 100 lines Master Gove: The same school as I. And learn the difference between an accusative and nominative pronoun.

	LORD DANNETT argues that not enough is being down to defeat and destroy the phenomena of Islamic State, who threaten the security of Britain - and mainstream Islam needs to denounce them.

It is therefore the subject that should be top of the In Tray in No 10, not just in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
To understand why the threat from the so-called Islamic State affects our security in the way that it does requires an understanding and an acceptance of what ISIL fighters and supporters are trying to do to achieve their objective.
Before ISIL burst into Iraq and Syria a year ago the notion of recreating the historic Islamic Caliphate had been endorsed and promoted by Osama bin Laden and his principal Al Qaeda lieutenants more than a decade ago.
Dead bodies at the Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait on Friday.The approach of the Islamic State is nothing less than the perversion of one of the worlds ancient religions for political gain, Lord Dannett writes
Alleged footage of the Kuwait Shia mosque blast
But it was generally thought that Al Qaeda was being contained somewhere between Afghanistan and Pakistan by NATO forces, including our own, and therefore the long term objective of creating a new Caliphate could be considered the philosophical ramblings of a hunted insurgent and placed on the back burner.
But the explosion of ISIL into our consciousness early last summer has changed all that. The issue of the Caliphate and what it means for us is a reality.
The ultimate objective of the new Caliphate is the restoration of Islamic influence to its high water mark in the fifteenth century, and that extends Islam beyond the greater Middle East, North Africa and parts of West Africa into southern Europe  specifically to southern Spain and the Balkans.
Does this matter, after all the influence of various religions has ebbed and flowed throughout history?
In general terms, in a more liberal and globalised world, it probably would not, or should, not matter, but the radical, hard line, fundamentalist Islamist approach that we are faced with today is a major challenge to the way of life not only to the nominally Judeo-Christian West but to mainstream Muslims too.
The approach of the Islamic State and its collection of allied groupings is nothing less than the perversion of one of the worlds ancient religions for political gain. The means, it would seem, justify the ends regardless of the horror involved.
Tunisia was attacked by ISIS, writes Lord Dannett, because it will drive tourists away from the country
Eye witnesses recount horror of Tunisia beach attack
It is against this background that Fridays attacks have to be seen. The one country that emerged from the mis-named Arab Spring with the prospect of better governance and a brighter future was Tunisia. But to the hard-line Sunni Muslim thinking of Islamic State this was a success that had to be destroyed.
Tunisia does not have much apart from tourists, therefore the tourists had to be attacked, intimidated and chased away. This may or may not happen, but after Fridays slaughter on the sunbeds many potential travellers and holiday-makers to Tunisia will think twice, or just simply book to go elsewhere.
The attack on the mosque in a generally peaceful Shia part of Kuwait was a different tactic but within the same perverted overall strategic plan.
To foment a Sunni-Shia struggle within Islam and then to take overall control in the chaos that follows is the operational design that the Islamic State death squads are following.
The fact that these two attacks took place on the same day within the holy month of Ramadan strongly suggests serious coordination within an overall plan.
On the other hand, the attack in France may or not have been part of the same coordinated set of actions. It seems as bizarre as it was outrageous and may have owed more to a personal dispute within an already very nervous France. Time will reveal more of the truth behind that attack.
So if the strategic objective of Islamic State is the recreation of the historic Caliphate and the operational design is to exploit the consequences of a fierce Sunni-Shia struggle for the heart of Islam, then the tactics of Friday should come as no surprise, notwithstanding the horror. The pressing question then becomes, what is our response to be?
It is tempting to say that we will stand on the side-lines of a civil war within Islam and merely contribute humanitarian or non-lethal aid but to do so puts our head into the sand and turns a blind eye to the purpose of that civil war.
David Cameron and Britain's allies need to put political pressure on countries like Saudi Arabia and Quatar who are dangerously ambiguousto Islamic State, and step up military assistance to help Muslims fight
David Cameron attends Armed Forces Day celebrations in Guildford
To have the aggressive, fundamentalist Islamism of Islamic State in southern Europe and the Balkans is something that we have to oppose now, and where it is today  far better to do so at arms length than in our own back yard.
After the NATO conference in Wales last Autumn a reluctant United States, cajoled into action by the energetic King Abdullah of Jordan and his supporters, eventually agreed a strategy to counter Islamic State and began to talk in terms of the need to defeat and destroy that phenomena. But with what degree of enthusiasm and commitment is that strategy being developed?
Yes, a coalition against Islamic State has been formed, many air forces are bombing ISIL fighters in Iraq and Syria, training teams are being deployed to build up the capacity of the Iraqi Army, the Peshmerga in northern Iraq and elements of the opposition forces in Syria, but is enough being done?
Against the gravity of the situation that I have described and the possible consequences for our own security, the answer has to be that we are not.
No one wants to see 5000 British troops deployed in the Middle East or in North or West Africa  a move that would most likely be counter-productive - but if we are to avoid that possibility there has to be a greater political and military will on behalf of our government, the United States and our European partners to do more  much more.
Political pressure needs to be placed on countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar who are dangerously ambiguous to Islamic State and military assistance needs to be stepped up in support of those Muslims prepared to fight to preserve the soul of their religion.
Moreover we need to hear the voice of mainstream Islam around the world denouncing and discrediting the perversion of their own religion.

	Labels 'lie' about the amount of salt in our food: Lab tests find amounts can be 10 per cent higher than stated on packaging

	High salt intake is linked to heart disease and stroke – two of Britain’s biggest killers - but new research shows that the true levels found in foods are often much higher than what is stated on the label.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Salt levels in popular products  including a healthy version of baked beans  are far higher than stated on the packaging, an investigation has found.
Heinz Beanz Reduced Sugar and Salt is meant to have 1.8g of salt in every 415g can. But a lab found that on average they contained 20 per cent more than that.
Nine out of 11 tins contained too much of the mineral to justify the reduced salt claim, found the research, commissioned for the Channel 4 programme Dispatches.
Hidden danger:High salt intake is linked to heart disease and stroke  two of Britains biggest killers - but the levels found in food are often much higher than what is stated on the packaging
And 18 out of 30 products tested had more salt than the label declared  including Dairylea ham and cheese crackers and Valley Foods chicken fillets.
High salt intake is linked to heart disease and stroke  two of Britains biggest killers. Most Britons eat more than the recommended maximum of 6g per day.
Dispatches also found that only 12 out of 73 companies that signed up to a voluntary salt reduction pledge in 2010 under the Governments Responsibility Deal had ended up meeting their targets.
A Heinz spokesman said its tins complied with the Governments guidelines. Mondelez, which owns Dairylea, said it had taken steps to rectify the matter and Valley Foods said it had amended their recipe to reduce salt.
Public health minister Jane Ellison defended the Governments record, saying average salt intake had reduced from 9.5g in 2000 to 8.1g in 2011.
Cutting it by a further gram could prevent almost 5,000 premature deaths a year and save the NHS 288million, she added.
Salt: Are You Eating Too Much? is broadcast on Channel 4 on Monday 29th June at 8pm.

	LIZ JONES: Last week was SO bad I'm taking the ultimate step - going offline

	Today, though, having just had the worst week of my life, I yearn for a few moments’ respite from the internet, after spending years in constant search of a wi-fi connection, by LIZ JONES.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Most spend half our lives in search of an internet connection
In the summer of 2000 I was on holiday in Jamaica, staying in Ian Flemings villa, Goldeneye.
It was the middle of the night, and I was in a rage because I couldnt find a phone socket to connect to the internet, which meant I couldnt file my copy.
In those days, you had to take a phone lead, and a different phone socket converter for every country (the socket for Milan was so huge it meant packing one less pair of shoes), before dialling up the internet.
I was crawling around the villa using a torch, as I didnt want to wake my boyfriend. It wasnt long before an armed security guard turned up, convinced I was being burgled. Which in a way I was: of my holiday and my sanity and my relationship.
My life since then has been one long, frantic quest for internet connection. In the foothills of the Himalayas, on a small island off Mozambique, in refugee camps in Haiti and on the border of Somalia, in a village in Bangladesh, in an earthquake zone in Pakistan, in a tent in Glastonbury.
I even had my phone screen held above my eyes when I came round from a general anaesthetic, just in case some awful tragedy had occurred while I was under.
I filed copy from my honeymoon, and even got my husband to read me the news headlines after undergoing laser eye surgery because I was wearing a metal grill over my eyes for 24 hours. My only respite was when on board a plane. This in turn made me phobic about air travel: not the flying or crashing part, but the safe landing, when I would switch on my smartphone and all manner of worrying emails would pop into the inbox.
Now even that brief holiday from being invited to Plan your funeral or Your Barclaycard statement is now ready or VAT to the quarter ending no longer exists, as you can use the internet on the plane. I have my smartphone and iPad with me everywhere  in the bath, horse riding, in bed, at my mums funeral  and it has become a ticking bomb of stress in my pocket when yet another email pops up that says, Are you OK? Have you read. and so I log on to some hateful remark, or read of some dreadful atrocity somewhere in the world.

For years, the health-conscious have sworn by the benefits of blueberries  a trendy import from the Americas.
But it seems there is something far better for us, much closer to home  the blackcurrant.
Researchers have found that the sharp berry, bushes of which used to be a regular feature in British gardens and allotments, contain far higher levels of health-boosting compounds than the blueberry.
researcher Dr Gordon McDougall of the James Hutton Institute near Dundee found blackcurrants can contain six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants of cultivated blueberries
We now eat tons and tons of blueberries, having been convinced they are a superfood that are particularly rich in polyphenols. These are naturally occurring antioxidant compounds said to help combat the development of heart disease and even cancer.
By contrast, fresh blackcurrants are a rarity on supermarket shelves. But researcher Dr Gordon McDougall of the James Hutton Institute near Dundee found blackcurrants can contain six to eight times the concentration of antioxidants of cultivated blueberries.
And exercise physiologist Matthew Cook of Chichester University has discovered that blackcurrants can even boost athletic performance.

Overlooking a sleepy valley in a remote area of the Hindu Kush, Langlands School is famous as the best in Pakistan.
But the peace has been shattered after a 97-year-old former British Army officer launched an astonishing move to oust the head teacher who he nominated as his successor.
Major Geoffrey Langlands, the last survivor of the Raj, mounted a coup to unseat Carey Schofield, 61, from the school in Chitral that bears his name. She only found out about his action when she returned to Britain and was surprised to discover her visa renewal had been inexplicably delayed.
Power play: Former school head Major Geoffrey Langlands, pictured above at his retirement in 2013
Last week, it appeared the Major had succeeded in his mission  with the help of some of his former pupils  after accusing Miss Schofield of upsetting parents and teachers with her rigorous management style. There was no question of her coming back he said in an interview.
But now Miss Schofield, who said the pupils behaved like the cast of St Trinians when she first took charge, has told The Mail On Sunday she has no intention of standing aside and will return to Chitral as soon as possible.

She said: Major Langlands has no power to sack me. Im not at war with anybody. The coup was presented as having been successful but actually it wasnt.
I am delighted by the support I have received not only from the governors but also from the teachers, the parents and the pupils for me to return and get on with the job.
It is very frustrating. This term, for example, for the first time in the senior girls school we had a school play going. It doesnt sound like much but it was a groundbreaking event in our district. Much bigger than this joke attempt at a coup. But because I was stuck here, I didnt see it and thats really heartbreaking.
It is a tale that evokes the days of the Raj and a lost empire.
Langlands, who is known as Pakistans Mr Chips  after the book about a beloved teacher  had been the principal of the school for more than two decades until Miss Schofield took charge in 2013 when he decided to step down.
The Major, who has taken tea with Princess Diana, enjoys celebrity status in Pakistan. He came to British India in 1944 during the last years of the Raj, before going on to teach cricketer Imran Khan and many of Pakistans future rulers at Aitchison college, known as the Eton of Pakistan.
Visa delays: Headteacher Carey Schofield in London last week
He joined Langlands, then Sayurj Public School, in 1989. Under his tenure, the school projected a reputation for excellence. But Miss Schofield says that was a myth.
Speaking near her one-bedroom flat in Chelsea, she said: The legend Major Langlands so successfully created was of the old military man who taught in England before the Second World War. Thats what people thought they were getting. In reality it was worse than any Pakistani school. The legend was built on sand.
There was no connection at all between the myth he was peddling and the education he was giving. The school was in a parlous state. School fees used to be collected in cash. There were widespread allegations of theft. Teachers were not always paid.
The school was like St Trinians. The children were not turning up and left whenever they wanted. Some teachers didnt come to school and if they did would sit drinking tea while the classes rampaged. There was no discipline. Weve had to restore order on every front.
Born in Surrey, Miss Schofield read English at Cambridge before becoming a foreign correspondent. She has written several books, including one about Pakistans army.
She says she drew on her experience as a school governor in Britain to transform Langlands. The school, founded in 1988 by local deputy commissioner Javed Majeed, now provides education for almost 1,000 girls and boys aged from four to 18. Under Miss Schofield, the bank now handles all fees, the school operates fully in English, students wear uniform and prospective pupils must sit an entrance exam. Earlier this year, she sacked eight of the schools 54 teachers who were under performing.
In Pakistan it is culturally not the norm to be sacked, Miss Schofield says. But Imran Khans government has said government schools will get rid of people who cant perform and hes right. All eight sacked teachers are taking the school to court for breach of their fundamental rights.
It is also suspected some contacted the Major for help.
When Miss Schofield flew to London last month, Langlands travelled to Chitral and attempted to seize control of the school. He also urged Pakistans interior minister, Chaudhry Nisar  a former pupil of his  not to renew Miss Schofields visa.
Nearly 200 parents and virtually all of the staff have signed petitions calling for the Majors orders to be ignored.
The visa hasnt been refused, Miss Schofield said. It just hasnt been granted yet. Langlands last night told the MoS: I have been working in Pakistan for 71 years and everyone has been satisfied with everything that I have done.
The real reason the lady doesnt like me is because Ive got too much support. I hope all will turn out well for the school but that cannot be with the presence of the lady.

As a result, it is all too easy for them to kill us, and very hard for us to protect ourselves. However hard we prepare, however elaborate our security measures, such attacks cannot always be forestalled or prevented.
There simply cannot be an absolutely reliable solution to this problem. There will be unpredictable danger, and we should beware of any voices that suggest we can ever be entirely safe.
We should also be cautious of attempts to use such events as a pretext for more intense surveillance of our lives or renewed restrictions on civil liberties, such as those attempted by the Blair and Brown governments.
This is the man ISIS has claimed carried out the attack in Sousse - named by them as Abu Yahya Al Qayrawani
Instead, we need a judicious mixture of policies: the encouragement of a British Islam, loyal to this country and vigilant against fanatics in its ranks; cautious engagement with the Arab and Muslim world, accepting the need to deal with unattractive regimes rather than optimistic attempts to introduce Western democracy by revolution or war; realistic warnings to travellers abroad about the risks they may face; uncompromising border controls, able both to detect dangerous arrivals and prevent them from entering our territory.
All of these need to be backed by continuing efforts to build intelligence and security services which know and understand those parts of the world from which the threat comes. The scalpel is more effective against such foes than the blunt instruments favoured by New Labour.
None of these things will be easy. Some of them will be costly, and divert scarce resources away from treasured or popular purposes. But, as we survey the grief and carnage of Sousse, and as the survivors hurry home from holidays that turned in a moment to horror, can anyone seriously say that it will not be worth it?

In Kobani, the YPG blew up a school building used by Isis earlier on Saturday, the Observatory said, and plumes of smoke could be seen rising into the air from the Turkish side of the border.
Isis killed around 200 civilians in the town and surrounding areas in the attack which started on Thursday, the Observatory said, describing it as one of the worst massacres committed by the group in Syria.
Badly injured: One of the victims of the violence in Kobane is led over the Syrian-Turkish border to safety
Devastated: A man seeks consolation after the latest devastating violence in the small town of Kobane
Kobani was the site of one of the biggest battles against Isis last year.
The Kurdish YPG force drove the militants back from the town with the help of U.S. air strikes, after four months of fighting and sieges.
The YPG previously described the latest attack on Kobani as 'a suicide mission' rather than an attempt to capture the town.
On Thursday, Dorpec Kobane, a Swedish/Kurdish doctor who had been treating wounded civilians and YPG members, began to fight when terrorists stormed the town and began shooting men, women and children.
He said their lifeless bodies were strewn across Kobane after the terror group  attacked the town from three sides.
Desperate Syrian Kurds from Kobane behind the border fences wait to cross into Turkey following the attack
Dr Kobane said: 'War is in full bloom in Kobane again. They came in last night disguised as Free Syrian Army and YPG militia men - they had their types of military uniforms on and they had shaved beards.
'The first thing they did was attack and take over the Doctors Without Borders hospital.
'Then four suicide bombers attacked different parts of the city. But they also had many snipers with them. They have been shooting like lunatics, mainly children and women.
'There are bodies of children and women spread all over - they shot like maniacs.'
In the interview provided by A Demand for Action, a global initiative protecting for ethnoreligious minorities in the Middle East, Dr Kobane added: 'Right now I have changed my doctors tools to a machine gun.
'I am helping our soldiers to eliminate the threat, I am more needed here now than in hospitals. We are less then 150 meters away from an ISIS stronghold - a section of the city they took over this morning.
'I cannot help anyone if all of Kobane is taken over by the terrorists.  Of course I wish I could help them. But we are strong. We will not give up. We will win Kobane back.'
Battleground: The offensive came just days after Kurdish forces captured the strategic towns of Tal Abyad and Ain Issa, placing them just 30 miles from the caliphate's self-declared capital of Raqqa in Syria
Dr Kobane has not been heard from since he was interviewed.
In the northeast, Isis seems to be attempting to wrestle Hasaka city from government control.
Syrian state television said on Saturday the city was safe and under control, but the Observatory said fierce clashes continued in the southwest, south and southeast.
Hasaka is important to all sides fighting in an area that sits between Isis held territory in Syria and Iraq and which reaches north up to the Turkish border.
Isis launched an assault on government-held areas of Hasaka early on Thursday and the United Nations says the violence is estimated to have displaced up to 120,000 people.
Isis said in statements on Saturday it attacked areas east of the city and in a video posted online claimed to have entered western areas. State television quoted the head of the police in Hasaka as saying its special forces had 'eliminated Daesh terrorists' in the city, using an Arabic acronym for the group.
Choking: Thick black smoke rises over the Syrian town of Kobane following the ISIS attacks on Thursday
Hasaka is divided into areas run separately by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and Kurdish authorities and has a mixed population of Arabs, Kurds and Christians.
Isis has been back on the offensive after two weeks of defeats at the hands of Kurdish-led forces, supported by U.S.-led air strikes.
This week the Kurds advanced to within 50 km (30 miles) of Raqqa city, the group's de facto capital.
Late on Friday Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi appealed to residents to take up arms to defend Hasaka.
'I call on every man, every young woman and every young man able to carry weapons to move immediately and join the frontline positions to defend the city,' he said on state television.
While Isis had managed to advance slightly in Hasaka on Friday, seizing one army position, heavy Syrian air force strikes hindered the attack, according to the Observatory.
The U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing government figures, said that since the attack on Hasaka started 120,000 people were estimated to have been displaced within the city and to surrounding villages, as well as to the northern districts of the province.

Angelina was in London having flown in earlier in the week to attend a lunch at the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office.
It was part of her work on UKforeign policy and involvement in an ongoing campaign to end  sexual violence in war zones.
According to a source the meeting took place at around 3:45 pm on Friday.
First time: Hollywood royalty mixed with the real deal when the two couples got together at Kensington Palace - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pictured here at the Lindo Wing in London after the birth of Princess Charlotte in May
'They discussed their shared interest in combatting the illegal wildlife trade' Wills and Kate, both 33, reportedly got on splendidly with the Hollywood A-listers. The couple are pictured at the10th annual ARK (Absolute Return for Kids) in 2011
Angelina, 40, was joined by husband Brad, 51, and they went to Kensington Palace for their chat.
The Royal couple were said to be 'really excited' about the afternoon tea,
The Duke and Duchess, according to the source, were joined by their son Prince George - who will be two years old in July, but the Jolie-Pitts children were not present.
The Hollywood pair brought a special gift for their daughter Princess Charlotte, who was born in May.
Globe-trotting: Angelina and Brad's children were with them in London but did not join them for the royal meeting. Ange is seen with five of her brood at LAX earlier this month
'Everyone got on splendidly' said the source.
'Brad and Angelina spent much longer with the Duke and Duchess than planned. They ended up staying for almost a few hours.'
The insider added: 'They discussed their shared interest in combatting the illegal wildlife trade.'
It was the first time meeting for the foursome. In 2014 they all attended the BAFTA awards but didn't cross paths.

Last week Angelina - who serves as a Special Envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees - visited Turkey to mark World Refugee Day.
While there she took daughter Shiloh, nine, to visit a camp for Syrian refugees in Mardin Midyat, southeastern Turkey.
Angelina and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in the city.
She also attended a Ramadan fast-breaking dinner at a nearby camp and visited refugees.
It was Jolie's third visit to Turkey since 2011, when the conflict in Syria began. The war has displaced more than 3million refugees, or almost a fifth of the pre-war population.

The USA, China and Russia all want to develop missiles that can travel at 4,000mph (stock image)
An arms race is speeding up between three of the world's most powerful countries, as each looks to develop missiles and fighter jets that travel more than five times the speed of sound.
Military scientists in the United States, China and Russia are independently attempting to build fighter aircraft and missiles that can travel at 4,000mph as part of a new type of hypersonic weapon.
While China and Russia want to invent missiles that are able to outsmart US ballistic defence systems, American researchers want the technology to be able to hit 'time sensitive' targets that can hit fast-moving objects with greater accuracy.
Should they be successful, the US Air Force is expected to seek the help of NASA to prepare pilots for travelling at Mach 5 speeds.
Scientists at the US laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, are within reach of creating weapons able to travelat Mach 5, with on official describing the development as 'game-changing technology', Michael Evans of The Times reported.
Researches in the US and Russia have carried out test flights of the new 'game-changing technology'
They have carried out four test flights of the X-51 WaveRider, its hypersonic vehicle, with one flying more than 230 nautical miles at 4,000mph, and the Russian tested their version, Yu-71, in February unsuccessfully.
On Thursday the deputy US defence chief said Russia was 'playing with fire' with its nuclear armament programme, and the country was determined to prevent it from gaining a significant military advantage.

Berlin: Flags fro all over the world are marched through the streets of the German city in this festival of tolerance and diversity
All welcome: The festival celebrates a wide and diverse range of communities with an open-minded attitude in Berlin
Dublin: The LGBT march on the streets of Dublin in a country which was previously known for its intolerance but which recently passed a law allowing gay marriage after a national referendum showed how far the public's attitudes have come
New York: People flood the streets to velebrate a victory just a day after the US Supreme Court's ruling on gay marriage across America
New world: Many people in the LGBT community in New York and America think the ruling will change the way the community is perceived
South Africa: People celebrate the parade with plenty of colour at Durban's North Beach for the international festival
Philippines: The parade spreads into the streets of Asia as people hold a giant rainbow flag as a homage to tolerance
Back in London: An estimated 950,000 people have taken part in Pride events in the last couple of weeks and this year's parade is expected to be the biggest yet
One man, wearing a jacket which appears to be made out of packets of confectionery, poses with a giant pink doughnut
One group in the crowd carries huge bunches of multi-coloured balloons, which all had the slogan 'PROUD!' on
Instead of carrying a rainbow flag, this marcher chose to wear a rainbow as a headband and completed the outfit with a diamant necklace
Others made bold and bright statements with their hair and make up, with this outfit completed with a white feather boa
This glittery rainbow mask was the perfect way for this marcher to show their support as they enjoyed the day
Bright hair and long eyelashes were a stand out feature at the parade, with these two supporters making sure they looked immaculate
Flag bearers from more than 200 countries also walked the route in a show of solidarity as others lined the streets to applaud
Even the strings some groups tied their balloons to were rainbow patterned to show their respect
Communities from across the world - including this Jewish group - came together to take part in the celebrated annual event
Others held placards from Amnesty International with the slogan 'love is a human right' written in pink text
One man wearing a pink shirt and yellow sunglasses hangs out of the window of a taxi as police laugh in the background
It is thought more than 260 groups were taking part in the celebrations and they were rewarded when the sun came out in London
Although the majority of outfits were brightly coloured this lady chose an all-black lacy outfit, which she matched with a black umbrella
A member of the community looked incredible with a beautiful painted face that made them look like they are a lion
The event is a time for the community and its supporters to get together and celebrate, like this lady who showed off her moves
Others went for more outlandish outfits, like this all-leather ensemble completed with cigar and dark aviators
Another donned what looked like it was based on a medical outfit and a silver mask, which covered their whole face

	Meet the Australian women have been training for six months to become professional MMA fighters. They suffered through intense mental and physical strain for TV series Wimp 2 Warrior.

35-year-old marketing and communications manager, Sharon Bosward, signed up to challenge herself, but was terrified of the end goal.
Id never watched a UFC fight before I signed up for this and then at the start we met up and watched it at a bar and I couldnt even watch it, I was just covering my eyes the whole time, I was horrified, Ms Bosward told Daily Mail Australia.
I thought it was the most brutal thing I had ever seen, I felt ill.
But after weeks of gruelling workouts and conditioning sessions, Ms Bosward started to understand the skill behind the fighting and was ready to take on the challenge.
Gruelling workouts: Ms Maan (left) and Ms Bosward (right) underwent major physical and mental changes
'It's something you're not used to': Ms Hidajat (left) and Ms Maan (right) cried both cried during the early sparring sessions
As the lightest female in her group, Ms Bosward suffered intense injuries, with the weight on her body from other fighters damaging the cartilage in her ribs, crushing her body and leaving her unable to sleep properly, lie down, sit up or laugh.
Ms Bosward also suffered a suspected broken nose during a shark tank session.
I was in there and on the ground and one of the other girls was trying to get me into a specific headlock and her shin came down, smashed me across the nose and mouth and she pretty much broke my nose, Ms Bosward said.
It was accidental but I just went into shock and sat there and started shaking and the next minute there was blood everywhere and two trainers had to come and lift me off the mat because the blood was just waterfalling and it kept going all day.
Before and after: Ms Bosward, 35, transformed her body during the intense conditioning training
'What I did to Sharon was quite shocking': Ms Hidajat (pictured) accidentally gave Ms Bosward a suspected broken nose
Renata Hidajat, 25, was the fighter responsible for the break and as someone who was already trying to cope with the concept of fighting someone, was shaken by the ordeal.
The first time I got hit in the face I just started crying instantly it is just something youre not used to, Ms Hidajat told Daily Mail Australia.
'It was quite shocking...my leg slipped from the sweat and my shin cracked her on top of the nose.'
What I did to Sharon was quite shockingmy leg slipped from the sweat and my shin cracked her on top of the nose and it was quite shocking to me because there was so much blood and I was questioning why I was thereI didnt want to hurt anyone.
Angela Maan, 33, was already fit before heading into the series as a keen trail running athlete, however found the training to be completely different to what she was used to.
Im still getting my heard around hitting people and for the first three weeks I basically cried during or after every sparring session, Ms Maan told Daily Mail Australia.
It was challenging mentally because Ive never been hit or hit anyone in my life and Ive seen people fight in movies but it is more confronting and emotional than I ever expected.
'It is more confronting and emotional than I ever expected': The women were not expecting the training to be as emotionally draining as it was
Before and after: Ms Hidajat became leaner and stronger over the six months
Ms Maan experienced extreme bruising and rolled both her ankles throughout the period, and says all the contestants have a method for coping with the pain.
We have a trick where we lather up in Voltaren and bruising cream and cling wrap ourselves while we sleep overnight to recover, she said.
Founder of Wimp 2 Warrior and trainer Richie Cranny, told Daily Mail Australia that to be able to get people mentally strong enough to step into a cage in front of 1,000 people and fight is tough.
They all get to that point where they doubt themselves and break down and cry but you dust them off and push them straight back out  theres no going home- they just need to get their gloves back on and get back in there, Mr Cranny said.
'You dust them off and push them straight back out': Trainer Richie Cranny believes in tough love
Wimp2Warrior: The ladies' final fights will take place across the 1st and 2nd of July at Luna Park
Its an armchair sport and people dont look at these athletes on TV and think I can do that but these people are doing it.
Regardless of the pain, the women have undergone incredible mental and physical transformations and will participate in their final fight on July 1st and 2nd at Luna Park in Sydney.
Proud of what they have achieved, the women say the regret of not fighting at the end is worse than any injury.
Regret would be a harder pill to swallow than copping a few punches in the face Im feeling pretty proud of myself, Ms Maan said.

	Andy Green crashes Jaguar XJ Bloodhound SSC at Goodwood
      </title>

	World land speed record holder Wing Commander Andy Green lost control of the specially built Jaguar XJ Bloodhound SSC rapid response vehicle at a notorious corner on the mile long hill climb at the event held in the stately grounds of the Earl of March.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
He admitted: 'it was 100 per cent my fault.
'We hit 100mph but I braked too late. I should have hit the brakes about a second or too earlier and I didn't'. I gave the car a problem it was not going to solve. I feel very disappointed'
With Green's foot flat on the brakes the car rammed into the safety straw bales with great force, smashing in the front of the car.
Andy Green drove the one-off Jaguar too quickly into the corner and skidded across the grass
The car was travelling at 100mph when Green pressed the brake pedal, fractionally too late
The 300,000 supercar ploughed through several strategically placed bales of hay to slow down cars
Jaguar said they were going to assess the extent of the damage on the once-off supercar
Both Green and passenger were wearing sear belts and crash helmets and the car was fitted with a roll bar.
Stewards and medics were on the scene within seconds to evacuate the two occupants.
The specially made one-off Jaguar has a top speed of 174 mph and can accelerate from rest to 60mph in around 4.5 seconds powered by a supercharged 550 bhp 5-litre engine.
It will be the fire support car for Green's 1000mph record attempt next year in the Bloodhound SSC supercar.
The car, pictured, has been specially prepared to support Andy Green's latest land speed record attempt
Unfortunately, Green went into one of the tight corners on the course too fast and lost control
Luckily, neither of the car's occupants were injured after the car came to an unexpected halt
Green already holds the world land speed record of 763mph which he set in 1997 in The supersonic Thrust SSC.
Green, 52, who has flown Phantom and Tornado jets during his career, came a cropper at the notorious Molcombe turn at Goodwood which has caught out many experienced drivers over the years.
Re-running the crash in his mind, Green said later: 'Jaguar are not going to be very happy.
'I had just commented that we were doing 100mph.
I saw the corner coming up. I should have braked earlier. It's a heavier car. I was a second or two too late. The car behaved impeccably. It was 100 per cent my fault.
Andy Green admitted that this was the first crash he has had since his 20s when a tyre blew on an old car
I braked too late. The wheels locked and we came off it became unrecoverable. It was a total cock up on my part.
He said: 'it was dustier and therefore more slippery than I'd expected. I felt very disappointed with myself. I should have done better than that.'
He said that despite his high speed record breaking exploits, this was the first crash he had experienced since his 20s when a tyre blew out on an old car.
A Jaguar spokesman said: 'The car is a one off. It took about 300,000 to develop specifically as a high speed support vehicle for the Bloodhound SSC project. We will assess the damage. The main thing is that no one was hurt.'
A spokesperson for the festival said: 'An incident occurred on Saturday 27, at 1017 at the Goodwood Festival of Speed involving a car on the Hillclimb.
'The car, a Jaguar XKR Bloodhound support vehicle, sustained damage. The driver, Andy Green, and passenger, Ray Massey, were uninjured.
'Two photographers and a TV cameraman were also involved. All three were taken to the nearby medical treatment room for a precautionary check-up, in line with Goodwoods safety protocols, and were released to enjoy the rest of the event.
'Mr Massey was also seen by a doctor.'
RAY MASSEY WRITES FROM THE PASSENGER SEAT OF ANDY GREEN'S CAR
It is amazing how slowly things move in a high speed crash as you hurtle inevitably towards a sickening crunch.
You can see it coming at you in slow motion. But there's nothing you can do about it - especially if you are in the passenger seat and it's the world's fastest man behind the wheel.
It had all started so well. Fans were asking for his autograph, taking photographs and chatting in awe of the quickest man on the planet. Ever the gentleman he obliged every request.
Ray Massey, left, with Andy Green, shortly before jumping into the one-of-a-kind Jaguar supercar
Moments after the high speed impact, Ray Massey, pictured, makes his way safely out of the car
Then the moment for the hill run of just over a mile up the Goodwood hill past the Earl of March's stately home.
We were strapped into the souped up Jaguar XJ Bloodhound SSC support vehicle. Helmets on. Seat belts checked. Roll-bars in place.
As we made our way up the line of Ferrari's, Aston Martins and other supercars we finally reached the start line.
With a screech of tyres and a roar of engine, Andy was off.
The first corner was taken firmly then the car accelerated hard.
'We're hitting a hundred,' he said as the crowd became a blur.
Then the infamous Molcombe corner came in view.
Andy hit the brakes. But too late. A second or two too late, he reckoned afterwards.
He tried to hold the car, but to no avail. Gravity and physics took over.
It was at this point that the world stopped spinning on its axis. Everything slowed dramatically.
I saw the track, then the straw bales. I could only brace and hope the sear belt would do the rest. It felt like counting down fro five to zero before the car hit the bales with almighty crunch. It was one hell of a thump. Straw everywhere. The seatbelt pretensioners pulled me back a bit but the impact was still significant.
Yes, I did feel it.
Within seconds the track marshals were on the scene pulling us out.
You couldn't fault the organisation
Andy Green was calm collected but clearly not a happy man.
And we both walked away from it.
'It was my fault entirely,' he apologised. 'I was going too fast,' he admitted in his disappointment.
Not something you hear every day from the world's fastest man.
But something some day to tell the grandkids.

Shortly after their relationship began, one newspaper mocked the couple with a cartoon titled 'The Disconsolate Sailor or Miss Longing For A Pole'
The couple got married in 1812 in a lavish ceremony that saw the bride wear more than 5million of diamonds and, with their newly-combined fortune, taste for fashion and lifestyle, they were propelled into the limelight.
But William soon showed his darker side with those preferring to gossip in society noting he was hosting an increasing number of parties as well as gambling his wife's fortune.
After their property - Wanstead House - was demolished and sold for scrap, William fled to France and Italy and was joined by Catherine and their three children.
Her wealth and charming manner led her to be pursued by the future William IV (pictured), but she turned him down for William Wellesley Pole
But he soon moved a mistress into the family home in Naples and, when he started to harm his children, Catherine moved them back to the UK.
She later suffered from chest spasms and died in 1825 aged just 35.
Speaking to MailOnline, author Geraldine, 47, said she was aware of Catherine's story living in Wanstead, and wanted to some of the preconceptions about her life for her debut book.
'It was so inspiring and had so many twists and turns - there was also lots of local interest in Wanstead', the Queen Mary graduate, who qualified from a masters in history, said.
'I wanted to overturn a lot of the views around her - I was looking to set the record straight about her.
'Reading her letters I found that she was actually quite remarkable, and not written by someone who was stupid.'

	Mass funeral for victims of Kuwaiti mosque bombing that killed 27

	Draped in state's striped flag, their corpses were carried overhead by weeping relatives ahead of a mass funeral at Kuwait City's Grand Mosque.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>The health ministry said that 40 wounded are still in hospital and the rest have been discharged.
Two of the dead were Iranian, the Shiite-dominated Islamic republic's foreign ministry said.
Friday's attack targeted Al-Imam Al-Sadeq mosque in Kuwait City during Friday noon prayers.
Condolences were being accepted for three days from Saturday at the Grand Mosque, the largest place of worship for Sunni Muslims, in a show of solidarity.
Kuwaiti health officials confirmed that 40 people are still being treated in hospital following the attack
Kuwait declared today a day of mourning to commemorate those murdered by the terror attack
The interior ministry said it has arrested the owner of the car the bomber used to go to the mosque, and that the driver was now being sought.
The vehicle's owner gave it to someone who drove the suicide bomber to the mosque, a ministry statement said.
The ministry said an unspecified number of suspects were held for questioning in connection with the attack that shook the small Gulf state.
No details were provided.
ISIS claimed responsibility for Friday's atrocity which was the worst ever terrorist attack in the country
Thousands of people followed the funeral cortege as the victims were brought to their final resting places
Kuwaiti authorities said they have made several arrests following the deadly terror attack
The government briefed MPs in a joint meeting about measures it has taken after the bombing, Sheikh Mohammad told reporters.
Kuwait's emir, the government, parliament and political groups and clerics have all said the attack aimed to stir up sectarian strife in the emirate.
Sunni religious and political groups were quick to condemn the attack which was claimed by ISIS, a radical Sunni group which considers Shiites to be heretics.
Shiites form a third of Kuwait's 1.3 million native population.
A mass funeral was planned for the victims of the Kuwaiti suicide bombing that killed 27 people on Friday
The bodies of some of those killed in the blast were piled into vehicles by mourning relatives on Saturday
Draped in the state's striped flag, the men's corpses were lifted on stretchers by groups of mourners
The cabinet announced after an emergency meeting on Friday that all security agencies and police had been placed on alert to confront what it called 'black terror'.
Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister Yacoub al-Sane said additional security measures will be taken around mosques and places of worship.
Kuwait declared Saturday to be a day of mourning.
The emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who visited the site immediately after the bombing, said the 'criminal attack is a desperate and evil attempt targeting Kuwait's national unity'.
Members of the parliament joined mourners as they made their way to the cemetery in the west of the city
Most of the victims were buried in a cemetery in the west of Kuwait city following a funeral service today
Countries and organisations including the United Nations and the United States deplored the bombing.
Eight Islamist, liberal and Shiite political groups condemned the attack in a joint statement and called on the government to confront extremists.
National oil conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corp. (KPC) said on Saturday it had raised security at oil facilities to maximum level.
Oil is Kuwait's main source of income, accounting for around 90 per cent of public revenues.
The OPEC member says it sits on around 10 percent of global reserves and pumps around 2.8 million barrels of oil per day.
The mass funeral comes as security sources say numerous arrests have been made in connection with the attack
A weeping man embraced another mourner as they carried the bodies into trucks on Saturday after the violent attack
Today a Kuwaiti security source said a number of people had been arrested in connection with the bombing, the worst in the state for years.
'Numerous arrests of people suspected of having ties with the suicide bomber have been made,' they told Reuters on Saturday.Local newspaper al-Qabas reported the number as three.
Officials previously claimed the attack had been intended to divide Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims across the state, with ISIS a radical strand of Sunni Islam.
Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed al Khaled al Sabah has described the interference as an 'evil hand in our homeland's security.'
Medics and security forces gather inside the Imam Sadiq Mosque attempt to secure the scene following the devastating blast on Friday
Rescue workers carry out one seriously injured man from the mosque attack, where as many as 27 worshipers were killed
Scores of survivors wandered the streets yesterday after the blast, their robes drenched in the blood of those killed and injured in the attack.
Witnesses described the young attacker as having been stood among around 2,000 worshippers before detonating the bomb.
Elsewhere on Friday two Tunisian gunmen slaughtered dozens of holidaymakers on a beach in Sousse.
The men opened fire on tourists in a horrifying attack which killed 15 Britons.
In France a man was decapitated and his head covered in Arabic inscriptions before being impaled on a spike near Grenoble.
Speculation has arisen over whether the three incidents were signs of a lengthy spate of violence launched by ISIS during the month of Ramadan.
Hundreds were injured in the blast which tore through the mosque as men observed Friday prayers

Women who take a year of maternity leave before having another baby shortly after are 'frustrating' for offices, Alexandra Shulman (pictured) has claimed
Women who take a year of maternity leave before having another baby shortly after are 'frustrating' for offices, the editor of Vogue has claimed.
Alexandra Shulman made the comments in an interview after revealing she only took four months off when she gave birth to her son.
The mother-of-one, who has edited the British version of the magazine for 23 years, added that she 'doesn't really get' working from home.
She told The Times magazine: 'I think [it] is frustrating for offices. You can't say, "Ooohhh, it's wonderful being away for a year, and now I am going to be away for another year".
'I can't pretend I think that's wonderful. I know I'm meant to...'
The comments were slammed by one parenting group, who said maternity leave 'is part of modern life'.
Rachel Burrows, from the UKs biggest parenting site Netmums, said: 'Ms Shulman raises some interesting points but while they may apply to staff at Vogue magazine, they are less relevant to the normal family.
'The latest figures show the average length of maternity leave is just six months while the average gap between siblings is now three years and eight months - so to suggest women are almost permanently pregnant or on maternity leave is simply wrong.
'Most mothers plan their families according to what they can afford and taking a year of maternity leave is a luxury available only to very few.
'The real issue here is that for many normal families, wages dont cover the cost of childcare, making part-time work with family help for childcare often the only viable option after children.
'Maternity leave is part of modern life so companies need to be wise and embrace what it can bring to improve both the company culture and the bottom line.'

'It's like looking for a green needle in a green haystack, but there are so many people out looking. It's half of Maidstone.'
Heavy-breathing Zombie is thought to have escaped by sneaking through one of Chris' conservatory doors.
Once in his garden, she is thought to slithered through the centre of town before reaching the long-grass 'heaven' beside Tesco.
Zombie - a Coastal Carpet Python - is one of nine pet snakes owned by reptile loving Chris Cini, who has spent the last 24 hours combing grass land to find his beloved pet
Mr Cini's wife Tracy reported Zombie - who feasts on rabbits and rats, bought for her by her owners - missing yesterday
A photo of the constrictor passing by a GP's surgery was posted on Facebook by local woman Sarah Bick.
It is seen with its head held high in the air with it's curving body in the short grass behind.
Mrs Bick uploaded the picture, saying urging the public to 'be careful'.
Kent Police confirmed that a member of the public contacted them to report seeing the snake  in the town's Chaucer Way.

Mr Cini's wife Tracy reported Zombie - who feasts on rabbits and rats, bought for her by her owners - missing yesterday.
A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'Our advice for anyone who spots a stray exotic (non-native) snake is to keep a safe distance, monitor the animal and call the RSPCA's Cruelty line.
'Never try to pick up a snake, unless absolutely certain that it has been correctly identified and that it is not venomous.'
To Chris, however, she's a joy to be around.

The footage then jumps back to the beach where two sunbathers in their swimsuits lie slumped on the ground having been caught in the gunfire.
The sun loungers that had been packed earlier in the day are now deserted, some stained with blood.
As the footage returns to the Sousse streets, the sound of gunfire pierces the silence once again and the person filming the video takes refuge behind a wall.
Locals and tourists run down the streets of Sousse as they try to escape the murderous gunman
A holidaymaker in a pair of swimming shorts surveys the scene yesterday during the massacre in Sousse
In the chillingmassacre yesterday a student named as Seifeddine Rezguipulled out a Kalashnikov hidden in a beach parasol and fired bullets at sunbathers lounging on a beachfront resort.
The gunman, who was laughing and joking among the midday bathers, was later shot dead by police after a rampage lasting at least 20 minutes.
Blood soaked bodies in swimsuits were left scattered among upturned sun loungers in what was the deadliest Islamist attack on westerners since the July 7 London bombings in 2005.
At least 39 people, including at least 15 Britons were slaughtered in the attack yesterday claimed by ISIS.
Under the scorching African sun and blue skies, locals and tourists sprint down the street away from gunfire
The government said it expected the number of British casualties to rise. Other casualties included German and Belgian tourists.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said today: 'I expect it (the number of British casualties) to increase. Most of the people were British and there were a large number of British caught up in the shooting.'
Thomson and First Choice today sent 10 planes to evacuate tourists from the Northern African state.
They said several of the people killed and injured were their customers and they were working closely with the local authorities to confirm the exact details of casualties.
Meanwhile Thomas Cook, which has sent an additional plane to the country to help bring home its own tourists, is offering holidaymakers the chance to change or cancel future bookings to Tunisia free of charge.
David Cameron is due to chair a meeting of senior ministers today to discuss the response to the attack in Tunisia.

	Unemployed Damien Dinobewei (pictured), of Birmingham, killed on-off girlfriend Tia Kounota when he was in a 'florid' state after stopping taking medication for his paranoid schizophrenia.

Ellis New said: 'The guy wants releasing from custody with all of Tia's friends and family informed of the date and let us decide his punishment.
'He stole a friend, a mother, a daughter, a sister, an aunty and he gets kept in a very comfy secure unit.
'What a joke. Miss you every day, Tia.'
The court heard Miss Kounota had been in a relationship with Dinobewei for several years but he could be 'volatile and controlling towards her'.
Dinobewei (right), of Stirchley, Birmingham, admitted a charge of manslaughter after killing partnerTia Kounota (left)
She was living at a friend's house in Halesowen, West Midlands, when she arranged to meet her lover on July 22 last year.
Prosecutor Mark Heywood told the court neighbours heard screams and saw Dinobewei pushing Miss Kounota into her pink Audi.
He added: 'She saw a muscular man dragging a woman by her hair and punching her repeatedly.
'Tia was screaming very loudly and appeared really distressed.'
The court heard Dinobewei sped off and was spotted at a number of locations as he bought petrol at a garage and drove towards the city centre.
He finally parked the Audi in Erdington, Birmingham, where witnesses saw him get out carrying a petrol can.
It was said in court that firefighters only discovered Miss Kounota's body after they put out the blaze because it had been 'inverted' in the vehicle with her head resting in the foot well
Mr Heywood added: 'He started to do something that they could not clearly see behind the driver's door.
'Moments later the car burst into flames and the defendant made his way off.'
Mr Heywood said firefighters only discovered Miss Kounota's body after they put out the blaze because it had been 'inverted' in the vehicle with her head resting in the foot well.
He said the likely cause of death was blunt force trauma, with compression of the neck, but she may have survived for up to 30 minutes before she died.
David Crigman QC, defending, said: 'They had a row which degenerated into a physical struggle.
'He punched her and held her in the area of the neck. She must have lost consciousness.
'Instead of trying to save her he panicked and drove off and made a crude attempt to save himself.'

	Return of the interest-only mortgage: Fierce competition among lenders is making it easier to take out risky loans

        <MainBody>Interest-only mortgages are becoming available once again thanks to competition among lenders
Interest-only mortgages are becoming easier to take out as a result of fierce competition among lenders.
The potentially-risky loans almost disappeared altogether in 2008 after being blamed for inflating the housing market ahead of the financial crisis.
But lenders have begun introducing deals allowing borrowers to take out an interest-only loan with a deposit of 25 per cent and pay it off when they sell the property, the Times reports.
Interest-only deals, where the borrower only pays off the interest each month and not the capital, were immensely popular prior to the financial crisis because they were cheaper in the short-term.
However they carry significantly higher risks in the long-term as homeowners could see a large hike in their monthly payments down the road.
In 2007 interest-only loans accounted for 33 per cent of the mortgage market but by last year that had fallen to just three per cent according to the council of mortgage lenders.
Now both Barclays/Woolwich and Leeds Building Society have introduced deals allowing borrowers to take out an interest-only loan with a 25 per cent deposit and use the sale of the property to pay it off.
High Street giant Natwest is reportedly considering to offer a similar deal.
Mortgage approvals in Britain reached a 14-month high in May, up around four per cent year-on-year, according to new figures out this week.

Flight tracking data showed the plane make a u-turn over Europe, and head back over the Channel.
The plane was a Boeing 777-200 and had a scheduled land time in Kuwait of 9.25pm (BST).
Al Jazeera have reportedly said the landing was forced due to an outbreak of food poisoning on board.
This has also been declared the reason by Russia Today UK news, who took to Twitter to report it.
Sky's Tom Parmenter told the news channel: 'It is something because of that terror attack in Kuwait yesterday, there is more reason to take note of a Kuwait bound jet turning round over Europe in midair and landing in London.'
On Friday at least 27 people were killed in a terrorist attack in Kuwait when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a mosque.
Islamic State have since declared responsibility for the attack.

	Shoppers were stunned to see Ramadan promotional stickers stuck to freezers containing pork products in Morrisons. Ramadan is the holy month for Islam, which forbids the consumption of pork at any time.

They need to be careful about this sort of thing.
Another customer spotted the same label in a store in Bedford, this time advertising ham and cheese ciabattas.
Twitter users were shocked by what has been called the insensitivity of the promotional stickers.
Morrisons defended itself, however, claiming that the sticker had been moved.
A spokesperson said: Somebody appears to have moved the sticker before the photo was taken.
We can confirm that the Ramadan sticker is not near any pork products this week.
Morrisons replied to a tweet from a customer, saying: 'I am very sorry for this, we are currently looking into this.'
The embarrassing mistake came just days after Tesco shame-facedly apologised for advertising smokey bacon-flavoured Pringles while wishing shoppers a Happy Ramadan.
Raza Hassan described the mistake, which she spotted in a branch in Liverpool Street, London, as hilarious.
Although the crisps dont actually contain pork, a number of Twitter users were still stunned by the mistake.
Ignorance: Tesco also came under fire for selling smokey bacon-flavoured Pringles as part of a Ramadan promotio
Mohammed Waqas described it as stupidity at its best while Mona Al Qazzaz tweeted: Please tell me this is a joke.
Another added: Thats me completely lost for words.
A Tesco spokesman admitted that the Pringles werent in the most suitable place.

Shock: Tesco's display led to widespread derision on Twitter, with many questioning Tesco's decision to promote the crisps in connection with the festival
A time of reflection and fasting: what is Ramadan?
The Islamic holy month will end with the Eid celebration on July 18 this year
Retail consultants reported this week that the religious festival is now the third most important to stores, behind Christmas and Easter, with meat, rice and fruit the biggest sellers.
Ramadan  during which eating and drinking is forbidden from sunrise to sunset  is observed as a period of fasting to commemorate the first revelation of the Koran to the Prophet Mohammed.

	Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has implied that the final ever show - which will air at 8pm tomorrow - is likely to disappoint the show's fans, as only half the footage is 'quite good'.

'Jeremy is all bombastic and [thinks] he's a brilliant businessman and he knows f*** all,' Mr Wilman, who first met Clarkson when they were students together at Repton school, told the Guardian. 
The BBC decided not to renew Clarkson's contract following an internal review, which found he was responsible for the 'unprovoked physical and verbal attack' on producer Oisin Tymon.
But Top Gear has been dogged by controversies almost since the beginning, the most famous of which include referring to Gordon Brown as a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot', and to Mexicans as lazy, feckless and flatulent.
The BBC was forced to apologise for the latter following a complaint lodged by the Mexican embassy.
BBC release trailer for final Top Gear episode featuring Clarkson
On form: The final show has been put together using films before Clarkson's contract was not renewed by the BBC, following a 'physical and verbal' attack on a producer in March
Looking to the future: The team are currently in talks with Netflix, ITV and Amazon Prime for the rights to the new show
Controversial: The BBC2 show has been plagued by controversy since it's beginning, including calling Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'
Mr Wilman is less than impressed by the series of offences, describing them as 'abysmal'.
'It was charmless, badly delivered and s***,' he continued.
'If you are making a show with a mental age of nine, you are going to act like a nine-year-old and at some point you are going to lose focus.'
The 75-minute final show will air at 8pm tomorrow night, and is expected to smash the show's current viewer record, of 8.4million.
Final screening: The final episode of the show will air at 8pm tomorrow night, and is expected to smash the show's current viewer record of 8.4million
New deal: But the team will not be able to keep the Top Gear name, as it was bought by the BBC three years ago in a multimillion pound deal that benefited Clarkson and Mr Wilman.
Camaraderie: According to Andy Wilman, the clips used in the final show are not their best, but are strong on camaraderie
The current record-holder is the episode that featured Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton as the 'star in the reasonably-priced' car in 2007.
Prior to that was the episode that featured Richard Hammond's return to the show following his near-fatal crash during filming in September 2006, which drew 8.1million viewers.
But the team are looking to the future, with ITV, Netflix and Amazon Prime currently battling it out for the rights for the new show, which is tipped for success.
Although they will not be able to keep the Top Gear name, as it was bought by the BBC three years in a multimillion pound deal that benefited Clarkson and Mr Wilman.
Chris Evans laughs off claims Clarkson was offered Top Gear job
Take over: The show will be handed over to Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has taken on the roles of both presenter and executive producer
Mr Wilman revealed that the team are now looking for a 'global platform', beyond that of Top Gear's record 350million fans around the world. 
But the original will be handed over to the Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has taken on the roles of presenter and executive producer for next year's return.
Evans is understood to be seeking more audience participation, with open auditions for the co-presenting role and opportunity for viewers to drive around the Top Gear track.
Wilman ended: 'Chris will do a good job of his type of show. It will be a healthy rivalry, there will be room for both of us.'

	The young woman, Laura, 24, (picture posed by model) admitted that she has had suicidal thougths since childhood, claiming 'life, that's not for me'. Belgian doctors have agreed and said they will help her die.

The young woman has been a patient of a psychiatric institution since she was 21, where she made friends with a fellow suicidal girl, who died from euthanasia 18-months ago. Since
She said: 'Even though my childhood certainly contributed to my suffering, I am convinced that I had had this death wish even though I grew up with a quiet, stable family.'
Laura said she has enjoyed the process of planning her own funeral but admits that her death will be difficult for her grandparents and her mother.
She said: 'When I was six, I was once in a room full of friends where guns were located. I remember I was able to hold one and was given directions. "It allows me to meet my end," I thought. "So it may be easy." I thought then the guns were not loaded, but later I learned that it was. If I had known this at that time, I might have pulled the trigger. I can easily imagine.
Belgium's leading euthanasia doctor Wim Distelmans, pictured, arranged a symposium on the practice in Auschwitz last year
'Death feels to me not as a choice. If I had a choice, I would choose a bearable life, but I have done everything and that was unsuccessful. I played all my life with these thoughts of suicide, I have also done a few attempts. But then there is someone who needs me, and I dont want to hurt anyone. That has always stopped me.
'What Im going to say on that last moment, I do not know yet. I have extensively written ideas in letters to my friends. I think everything has already been appointed. Maybe I will finally figure it out with these words, "Those who are about to die salute you."'
According to the most recent figures, the numbers of people choosing to end their own lives has surged by 27 per cent over the previous 12 months.
Figures showed that in 2013 there were 1,816 cases of euthanasia, compared with 1.432 in 2012. 
Of the total number of cases in 2013, 51.7 per cent were male patients and 48.3 per cent were female.
Elderly people aged between 70 and 90 years made up just over half (53.5 per cent) of the total. Those aged between 60 and 70 years represented 21 per cent and those aged over 90 years seven per cent.
The under-60s accounted for just 15 per cent of the total number of cases.
In 2003 Belgium was the second country in the world to legalise euthanasia after Holland liberalised the law a year earlier, becoming the first country since Nazi Germany to permit the practice.
Over the past decade the numbers of Belgians dying by euthanasia has crept up incrementally.
There was a 25 per cent increase in the number of euthanasia deaths from 2011 to 2012, soaring from 1,133 to 1,432, a figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country.
In February Belgium extended euthanasia to children who are terminally-ill and in a state of unrelieved suffering.
They must also be judged to have capacity of discernment, affirmed by a psychologist, and the consent of their parents before they can die by injection.
Anti-euthanasia campaigners have argued that such safeguards have consistently proved to be meaningless.
They say that besides patients who are gravely ill euthanasia is used increasingly on people with depression or non-terminal conditions.
Those killed include deaf twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem, 45, who were granted their wish to die in December 2012 after they learned they would likely to become blind.
Belgium's leading euthanasia doctor Wim Distelmans, pictured, arranged a symposium on the practice in Auschwitz, which attracted major international condemnation. 
Last year Nancy Verhelst, 44, a transsexual, was also killed by euthanasia after doctors botched her sex change operation, leaving her with physical deformities she felt made her look like a monster.
New figures have shown that five Belgians die with the assistance of doctors each day (pic posed by models)
However, some reports claim that Belgium's liberalised Euthanasia regime has led to some patients being killed without their permission.
An academic report found that around one in every 60 deaths of a patient under GP care involves someone who has not requested euthanasia.
Half of the patients killed without giving their consent were over the age of 80, the study found, and two thirds of them were in hospital and were not suffering from a terminal disease such as cancer.
In about four out of five of the cases, the death was not discussed with patients subjected to involuntary euthanasia because they were either in a coma, they were diagnosed with dementia, or because doctors decided it would not be in their best interests to discuss the matter with them.
Very often doctors would not inform the families of plans to lethally inject a relation because they considered it a medical decision to be made by themselves alone, the report published by the Journal of Medical Ethics said.
The report raised new questions over Belgiums increasingly controversial 13-year-old euthanasia law, which has won wide acceptance from the medical establishment, and which now allows even children to be killed by doctors.
Report author Professor Raphael Cohen-Almagor of Hull University said: The decision as to which life is no longer worth living is not in the hands of the patient but in the hands of the doctor.
It should also be noted that deliberately ending the lives of patients without their request is taking place in Belgium more than in all other countries that document such practices, including the Netherlands.
It is worrying that some physicians take upon themselves the responsibility to deliberately shorten patients lives without a clear indication from the patients that this is what they would want.
The Israeli-born politics and philosophy professor added: The Belgian population should be aware of the present situation and know that if their lives may come to the point where physicians think they are not worth living, in the absence of specific living wills advising physicians what to do then, they might be put to death.
Belgiums Euthanasia Act restricts the practice of mercy killing to adults and emancipated children who are suffering unbearably and who are able to consent. It remains officially illegal for doctors to kill patients who have not given their consent to death.
The study found, however, that many GPs are killing their patients without consent and that lack of consent may be more common than officially-approved deaths.
Given that ending patients lives without request is more common than euthanasia, it is suggested to urge the Belgian medical profession to put this issue high on its agenda, Professor Cohen-Almagor said.

	Plus-size fashion vlogger Loey Lane takes down critics of fat girls
      </title>

	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3141032/Plus-size-fashion-vlogger-takes-hateful-critics-claim-fat-girls-shouldn-t-wear-two-piece-swimsuits.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490

        <Description>
	Loey Lane, 22, talks about beauty and plus-size fashion on her popular YouTube channel. In a recent video, she came up with a tongue-in-cheek list of reasons why 'fat girls shouldn't wear bikinis'.
      </Description>

Rocking it: On Instagram, Loey shows off many pieces in her closet - including several two-piece swimsuits
Every body is beautiful: The beauty and fashion vlogger says that people tell her that fat girls don't look good in bikinis - but she begs to differ, and notes that everyone has different tastes
Body-positive: Loey (pictured with her husband) says it's 'bull' to claim that fat girls showing so much skin makes you 'uncomfortable', since the same isn't said about thin girls
'The second thing I'm told a lot is that it makes people uncomfortable... seeing this much skin on a bigger woman makes someone else uncomfortable,' she continued.
Her response to this objection is that one person shouldn't be able to tell another what she can or cannot wear based on their own preferences.
In addition, it seems unreasonable to Loey that only 'fat' women showing skin causes this discomfort.
Thin women are not told to stop wearing whatever they're wearing because it makes someone else uncomfortable.
'Other body types are not told this,' she says. 'Thin women are not told to stop wearing whatever they're wearing because it makes someone else uncomfortable. So I'm gonna call bull on that.
'The third [objection] is that we are promoting obesity. So someone who's plus-size, fat, curvy - whatever you want to call it - if they are in less clothing, we are promoting obesity,' she says with air quotes before adding sarcastically: 'Anyone who is fat and not completely miserable is promoting obesity, by the way.'
Loey is by no means 'promoting obesity', she says. When she wears her bikinis on the beach, she is neither 'shoving her face full of junk food' nor 'screaming at the top of her lungs' that other people should be overweight, too.
She is usually just minding her own business. But that doesn't stop strangers from saying things to her like 'Yo, fatty, lay off the hamburgers'. When she is eating fruit, they'll say things like: 'Oh my god, look at her pretending to be healthy.'
Who asked you? The blonde beauty had been verbally attacked by strangers, who have made mean comments to her at the beach; when she eats fruit, they say things like: 'Look at her pretending to be healthy'
No agenda: Another concern Loey often hears is that heavy girls who show skin are 'promoting obesity'
Do your own thing: Loey criticizes those who take time out of their day to make someone else feel bad with unsolicited vitriol
The final comment she's received regarding her penchant for baring her body 'really, really, really bother me,' she said.
When larger women show skin, Loey said, 'I get told a lot that we're asking for feedback. So that's to justify someone else saying to me, "Hey, that swimsuit looks like shit on you, go work out."'
She explains that this kind of comment is 'genuinely scary' to her. No one is looking for a stranger's approval, she argues.
Even if these plus-size people are sharing images on social media, it's likely because they think 'they look bomb in it', so to tell them otherwise is just cruel.
'That is such a bad and negative thing to do,' Zoey lectures, 'and to waste all of your precious time living such a negative life or having such a crappy outlook, to think that someone else really cares about your opinion... it's scary, it's egotistical, and you mightwant to reevaluate things.'
She then wraps up the body-positive message with a sarcastic revelation that - surprise - none of the objections she listed are credible.
'You know, now, going over this list, I don't really think any of these excuses are valid,' she concludes. 'So does that mean we get to continue wearing what we want?'

La Compagnie
The all-business class airline, which runs a regular service between Paris and New York and London and New York, is as well known for its stylish uniforms as it is for its unparalleled service.
With a nod to the company's French origins, La Compagnie enlisted the help of Parisian fashion house Vicomte A to design the in-flight styles.

Female crew don chic, yet practical culottes and a Celeste blue silk scarf, while the smart male stewards are clad in a three-piece suit and blue knitted tie.
It's far less formal than one might expect from such an airline - not that we're complaining.
Aeroflot
The Russian national carrier's eye-catching uniforms are as noteworthy for their retro blazers and tilted caps as they are for their bold orange hue.
In 2010, the new uniform was created by Julia Bunakova and Evgeny Khokhlov, two prominent local designers from St. Petersburg.
While the women's uniform comes in a chic dark blue colour, as well, specifically for the winter months - it's their red tangerine summer offering that tops our best-dressed flight crew list.

The uniform was crafted by Julia Bunakova and Evgeny Khokhlov, two prominent St Petersburg designers, in 2010
We're not the only ones who think so.
In 2013, the Aeroflot cabin uniform was voted to be the most stylish in Europe in a survey organised by global travel search site, Skyscanner.
And with white gloves and neckties that hark back to the golden age of flying, passengers just might feel as though they've transported back to the swinging Sixties when they step on board.
Emirates
Emirates is home to some of the most sophisticated uniforms in the business.
But instead of sourcing out the designs to an internationally renowned fashion house, the airline decided to employ British designer Simon Jersey, a longtime leader in corporate clothing.
First introduced in 2009 - and using colours and fabrics that mirror the elegance of the brand - the new uniforms simply improve upon the look and comfort of yesteryear's designs.
Emirates is known to have some of the most sophisticated uniforms in the business - in particular, its gorgeous red and white headpiece
For men, a rich chocolate suit with subtle pinstripes was chosen while women wear a mushroom-coloured suit with inverted red pleats
For men, a rich chocolate coloured suit with a subtle cream and red pinstripe was chosen. Women, on the other hand, wear an elegant mushroom coloured suit with a matching chocolate and red pinstripe pattern.
A cream blouse is worn by both cabin crew and pursers and an inverted pleat on the skirts offer a flash of red when the female flight attendants walk by.
But its the headwear - the signature red hat and white scarf - that is the crew's best accessory, also offering a nod to the Dubai-based brand's culture and history.
Air France
Crafted by Christian Lacroix, Air France's uniforms have long been considered to be one of the most unique in the air.
With a long history of working with top designers, the airline has previously contracted Balenciaga and Dior in the 1960s.
However, the latest Air France incarnation, which was introduced in 2005, may be the best yet, asLacroix's now-signature red gloves and sculptural red bow-tie belts perfectly accent the navy blue theme colour.

But the following year brought relief for the 55-year-old mother-of-two, when Andy finally took the title after defeating Serbian Novak Djokovic in the final.
'Of course I was happy, but mainly relieved, because of everything we had experienced over the years,' she continued.
The 28-year-old is looking good this year to reclaim his title from Djokovic, after winning his fourth Queen's Club title and reaching the semi-finals of the French Open at the beginning of this month.

The tennis ace has credited his new martial status for boosting his game, after marrying 27-year-old Kim Sears.
But Judy thinks the improvement in his game is down to his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, after Andy split last year from the more 'aggressive' trainer Ivan Lendl.
She thinks that Ms Mauresmo has helped develop a more feminine and intuitive side to his game, describing her as a 'smart tactician'.

Judy claims that Andy's game has reclaimed more of the 'skilful flourishes' that she so enjoys, as her favourites are 'players with a bit of guile'. 
Andy's first Wimbledon challenger is Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin, the current world number 58, who is coached by his wife Anastasia
Murray has previously said he is 'a tough guy to beat', but has defeated him in both of their previous clashes.

	'Too posh to pick up poo': Furious locals stick up sarcastic posters after getting fed up with lazy dog-walkers

	Posters mocking local dog owners have popped up in Harwood, Greater Manchester, telling them to take more responsibility in picking up their dog poo as 'the poo fairy' certainly won't do it.

Elaine Michelle Smith - who posted the pictures onto Facebook in the first place said she spotted them on Thursday.
She wrote: 'Love the new signs posted on the alleyway near Harwood meadows school that someone's put up - let's hope people take notice.'
Brad Latham-Holt added: 'Haha brilliant, it is like a minefield along that path - minging.'
Grammar fan Pauline Bateson astutely commented: 'If they are ignorant enough to let their pooches poo, they won't know the difference between too and to.'
Dog owner Joanne Davies blasted: 'I've only had my dog for 12 months and always pick up but I can't believe how lazy some dog owners are.
One of the signs mocks the pet owners by saying: 'The Poo fairy doesn't live here...Scoop your Poop'
'It's not difficult to pick it up &amp; carry it home. Unfortunately this is not just a problem in Bolton.
'It does seem to be cleaner in areas that have more bins so come on Bolton Council give us a bit of support.'
Anna Carlin chimed in: 'They should put these up for horse poo too. Ridiculous how much poo is over the streets.'
But poster Ms Smith pointed out: 'At least you can put that on your roses!'
Jackie Greenhalgh added: 'Thank god! It's disgusting in the morning.'
Last January cash-strapped Bolton Council revealed their dog mess bins were actualy being 'phased out' - instead urging owners to used regular litter bins, or take the mess home.
Joanna Davis communicated her frustration at what she branded 'lazy' dog walkers on Facebook
Local woman Lyndsey Leatherbarrow said the onus was now on the council to take more action
Facebook user Niomi Stanley has admitted that she goes as far as taking a different route just to avoid the excessive dog mess
Council chiefs said budget restrictions mean they are currently unable to install new litter bins or dog waste bins.
Yet at the same time it was revealed incidents of fly-tipping went up by 40 per cent last year, with 4,000 reports across Bolton.
The council said it has been phasing out dog waste bins for the past five years - with the authority describing the cost of maintenance of the bins and disposal of the waste as 'prohibitive'.
Waste collected in dog bins is classed as clinical waste and must be disposed of by incineration.
Just because there is not a bin near you does not mean you should drop it on the floor. There is no excuse for that - either take it home or find another bin.
Councillor Nick Peel
The council's cabinet member for the environment, Cllr Nick Peel said that while there was no 'dedicated budget' for new litter bins.
Cllr Peel said: 'Just because there is not a bin near you does not mean you should drop it on the floor.
'There is no excuse for that - either take it home or find another bin.
'When people are putting dog waste in the litter bins it should obviously be properly bagged and if the bin is too full then people should find another one or take it to their bin at home.'
A spokesman for Bolton Council said: 'Due to budget restrictions, we are unable to install both new litter bins and new dog waste bins at the current time.
'With regards to dog waste bins, we have been phasing these out over the past five years.
'Instead we encourage the public and dog walkers to put their dog waste into any litter bin and it will be collected along with the rest of the litter.
'If a resident does have a particular issue with dog waste in their area, we would advise them to contact the contact centre and our Education and Enforcement team will be in touch to discuss the issue.'

	Paul Barker, 39, and wife Kerry, 30, from Hetton, Sunderland, were due to appear in court on Tuesday over the theft of nine bottles of wine worth £89.91 but failed to arrive for their 10am hearing.

They initially appeared at Sunderland Magistrates Court in May after being taking the food on the supermarket's CCTV.
Both admitted theft but were given absolute discharges.
Their absence comes after they scavenged from bins outside their local Tesco Express (pictured) in Hetton, Sunderland, after their benefits were stopped
They said they were forced to live off discarded food, which they allege supermarkets would otherwise throw away, because they could not afford to feed themselves
Mrs Barker, who gave up her job at Durham County Council five years ago due to depression,was charged with theft and her husband, who left his job as a scaffolder after breaking his back, was accused of handling stolen goods on June 7.
Commenting on their 'no show', Mr Barker's solicitor Brian Chapman said: 'I would invite you to issue a warrant to see whether these people have indeed been stuck inside the bins in Tesco.'
A warrant was issued for their arrest. The couple will now be brought before the court when they are detained.

	British universities allow foreign students to use dictionaries in exams

	EXCLUSIVE: Among the dozens of institutions which give finalists access to a dictionary are some of the country's most prestigious universities, including 12 members of the elite Russell Group.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article
Share
In total, half of the Russell Group, which is often thought of as the top tier of British universities, sanction the use of dictionaries in exams.
However, Oxford and Cambridge, along with most leading London universities such as University College, King's College, Imperial and LSE, do not allow the practice.
University bosses claim that letting foreign students use dictionaries evens the playing field for all - pointing out that they have to attain a minimum level of English to get a student visa.
Prestigious: The University of St Andrews, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met, is one of the elite universities which allows the use of dictionaries
However, some experts have suggested that it is unfair to let one group of students use dictionaries when others are not allowed to do so.
In addition, critics link the regulations to universities' push to recruit more students from outside the EU, who pay fees many times higher than those demanded from British students.
Anger: MP Philip Davies said the university rules were 'absolutely ridiculous' and warned that institutions could compromise their standards
Tory MP Philip Davies told MailOnline: 'I think this is absolutely ridiculous. An exam should be the same for everyone and universities shouldn't be bending the rules to help foreign students and giving them qualifications when their standard of English is not up to scratch.
'It is sad that in their desperate rush to get as much money from overseas students as possible that our universities are prepared to compromise on their standards and rigour.'
Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, added: 'Once you give a dictionary to the non-English speaker, you're discriminating against English speakers. It's confusing, it's misleading, it's unfair.
'They should not be sacrificing academic integrity to recruit more foreign students.'
Universities UK, the body which represents all higher education institutions, warned that relaxing standards for overseas students could be damaging to academic excellence.
Chief executive Nicola Dandridge said: 'International students are subject to numerous tests to ensure they meet high English language requirements.
'For overseas students to benefit from studying at a UK university, they need a high level of English so that they can complete written assessments and take part in discussions and seminars.
'It is in no one's interest for international students to come to the UK if they are unable to complete their studies because they are struggling with the language.'
A spokesman for the UK Council for International Student Affairs said: 'We would welcome any support for international students.'
MailOnline surveyed a total of 127 universities in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Of those, 62 said that they do allow foreign students to use dictionaries in exams, 53 said they do not, and 12 failed to respond.
Help: At dozens of universities, students from outside the EU are given permission to take in dictionaries translating between their native language and English
Around a dozen of the 62 universities let all students use dictionaries, regardless of whether or not their first language is English.
Most of the institutions specify that students can only use a translation dictionary, between their own language and English, but some allow them to use regular dictionaries which contain words' definitions in English only.
Nearly all universities say that they check students' dictionaries to ensure that they do not contain any notes or additional material which could fuel suspicion of cheating.
Some only let students use dictionaries which are provided by exam invigilators, in a further attempt to stop students taking advantage of the policy to smuggle in crib sheets.
Universities have been keen to recruit as many students as possible from outside the EU because there is no cap on the level of fees they can charge.
Foreign students typically pay up to 14,000 a year for most courses, compared to a limit of 9,000 for students from the UK and other EU countries.
The Government requires overseas students to sit an English language test in order to qualify for a visa.
In addition, the most prestigious institutions have their own tougher language exam, which they say ensures that all students are completely fluent in English by the time they start their degree.
There is no official Government policy on the use of dictionaries in exams, because as autonomous institutions universities are free to set their own regulations in most areas.
The Quality Assessment Authority, which certifies degrees, says: 'Through inclusive design wherever possible, and through individual reasonable adjustments wherever required, assessment tasks [must] provide every student with an equal opportunity to demonstrate their achievement.'

Extra police patrols were being deployed in the area this weekend, but officers said the incident was being treated as 'isolated'.
Chief Inspector Patrick Holdaway said: 'My thoughts go out to the children who have been hurt and their families. We're providing assistance to them at the current time and both children are being treated in hospital for their injuries.
Two boys were stabbed as they walked home from school along this road (pictured) this afternoon
Police cordon off the scene where two boys were stabbed
'We'd like to reassure the local community that no-one else is being sought in connection with this assault at this time.
'Thankfully no-one else was hurt in the incident and there is no further risk to members of the public.
'Our inquiries indicate that a school in the local area had an inset day, so there were not large groups of parents and children in the area when the assault happened shortly before 3pm.
'A cordon will remain in place overnight to preserve evidence. Local officers will also be patrolling across the weekend and will be speaking to local residents to keep them informed.'
Police were last night speaking to witnesses and appealed to anyone who may have seen anything out of the ordinary in the area shortly before 3pm to come forward.
A police spokesman said: 'Police deployed immediately to the scene and a 43-year-old man of no fixed address was arrested.
'He has been taken into custody and detectives have commenced an investigation.'
Anyone with information is asked to call Hampshire Constabulary on 101, quoting Operation Narrow.
Witnesses said a knife was found in the road and that pupils and parents had recently been warned about a man hanging around the neighbourhood, exposing himself to pupils.
A woman working at a local children's nursery said the boys were walking home from nearby Warblington School at the time of the attack.
She said: 'When we heard about the attack we went into lockdown to make sure our children here were protected.
A policeman talks to a member of the public on the junction between Southleigh Road and Horndean Road
'One of our workers was at home and rang in with details as one of her friends' friends is the mother of one of the boys.
'He is 12 and it seems he was walking home with a friend when they were victims of what we understand to be a knife attack.
'It's a busy road at that time with school traffic so I would imagine there were people on the scene very quickly.
'We know police and ambulances rushed there and we had the police helicopter going overhead.'
The front page of the Warblington School website currently features a warning to parents and pupils to be 'extra vigilant' in the area at the moment.
The undated post reads: 'We would ask parents to ensure that their children are extra vigilant during their journey to and from school as there has been an incident of exposure to a student from this school within the last 24 hours. The police are involved.'
Witnesses said a knife was found in the road and that pupils and parents had recently been warned about a man hanging around the neighbourhood, exposing himself to pupils
Locals posted comments about the stabbing on Facebook this evening.
Sean Murtagh said: 'My other half passed just as the police were blocking the road. She saw a knife in the road, whether that's related to this incident or not I don't know.'
A parent of a child at the school, Pauline Matthews, said: 'There was trouble a few weeks ago there. I got a text from the school saying there was a bloke hanging around exposing himself to kids.'
A spokesman for Hampshire Constabulary today said the National Police Air Service have been called out to help police on the ground.
Extra officers will be patrolling the area this evening to provide reassurance to those living in the area.
No one else is being sought by police in connection with the incident and a cordon is in place at the scene on Horndean Road.
Police were called to the scene shortly after 3pm after a 999 call came in to say the two youngsters had been attacked in the street by a man. One of the boys was taken to Southampton General Hospital (pictured)
A witness on the ground who arrived near the scene half an hour later said: 'There was a very loud helicopter circling above and all the mums and children from the nearby school were wondering what was going on.
'There were lots of police cars and an ambulance.
'I just can't believe what's happened. It's horrific. And in a small town like Emsworth which is usually so quiet. It's awful.
'I saw a few young girls on the side of the road very upset.'
Delivery driver Derek Wherry, 39, who lives on the road where police arrested the man, described the news as 'worrying'.
He said: 'We don't expect this to happen around here.
'There's so many police around here you wouldn't believe it. There's been police cars all afternoon screaming around the place and helicopters circling above.
'It's worrying to know that one of the kids had been taken to Southampton General but also reassuring to hear someone is in custody.'
Hampshire Constabulary (headquarters pictured) said a man had been arrested in relation to the attack and are appealing for witnesses

Martinstetter warned 'You can buy these things on the internet and easily put explosives on them but there is no efficient protection against them.
The system, which the German Ministry of Defense is part funding, envisages an external sensor like a radar spotting the target before a low power laser beam illuminates it for better targeting.
An optical sensor then locks onto the target and guides the laser.
The new weapon is reminiscent of the one used by the Death Star in the propular star Wars films
The drone, circled, landed in front of Ms Merkel as she delivered a speech in Germany sparking fears that the device could easily be used to commit a terrorist act.
The four, 10 kilowatt lasers are focused into one beam by a mirror. The sytems' efficiency is about 30 percent, meaning that 400 to 500 kilowatts of battery power are required to produce the 100 kilowatt laser.
'We have designed a system with six lasers and 8 to 10 is possible, but 4-6 is the best number for reasons of size,' Martinstetter told Defence news.
The four laser, 100 kilowatt set-up would be mounted on the same type truck used to ferry the MEADS missile defense system, he said.
The firm plans to have the ability to knock out IEDs using a 5 to 20 kilowatt laser mounted on a vehicle at a range of less than 500 meters , as well as the ability to blind or destroy optics using a 5 kilowatt laser at a range of 2.5 kilometers.
Five years after the signing of a full development contract, the firm would be able to offer a counter piracy laser with a range of less than 1,000 meters using a 10-40 kilowatt laser.
Experts are
A mid to long range plan is for an antimissile laser firing a 100 kilowatt beam up to 3 milometers .
'We are now working on a deployable, ruggedized laser demonstrator, but the principal technology is proven,' said Martinstetter.
Earlier this year it conducted the first tests of its systems.
Man tackled to ground for trying to fly 'drone' over White House
It deployed a laser effector to acquire, track, and defeat a free-flying mini drone, the first time such technology has been used to this effect.
The mini drone was destroyed within seconds of the start of the test which was carried out at MBDA Deutschland's testing area in Schrobenhausen.
The drone in question manoeuvred in the target area at a range of about 500m with the test proving the laser effector's capability to combat realistic targets with precision, speed and safety.

	Robert Ewing, 60, is accused of grooming the 'very troubled and vulnerable' Blackpool youngster before he allegedly beat her to death, possibly with a hammer.

'We are going to suggest, with reasons connected with her background, there were powerful reasons for Paige Chivers to finally leave home.
'Can I be sure she is alive? No I cannot but equally you cannot be sure she is dead either. The evidence is simply not good enough to make any rational, careful person be sure.'
Detectives hunting for Paige Chivers, who vanished in suspicious circumstances eight years ago, dug up a farmer's field amid fears she maybe buried in a shallow grave but still no trace of her has been found
Police investigate a site in Thornton Cleveleys in Lancashire during an earlier search for Paige's body
An extensive proof of life inquiry had not found any evidence Paige was alive and she had yet to claim a 'significant' inheritance sum left to her on her mother's death once she turned 18, the jury heard.
The Crown has told the jury they can be sure Paige is dead even though no body has been found.
Ewing was arrested in connection with her disappearance in September last year and is currently on trial at Preston Crown Court.
But Mr Denney said there are people who 'badly' do not want to be in contact with the authorities for various reasons.
He also pointed out that four separate, independent witnesses - including her brother - said they had seen Paige locally in the weeks after her supposed murder
He said: 'How are you to exclude that Paige Chivers is not findable in the United Kingdom because she is elsewhere?
'All I say to you is the fact is if Paige Chivers or any 15-year-old wanted to disappear and stay disappeared she certainly could if she wished.'
In his closing speech to the jury on behalf of Ewing,s barrister Stuart Denney QC suggested the 'off the rails' and 'wild' teenager (pictured) had decided to run away and is still alive
Police search field for the body of missing Paige Chivers
Addressing the inheritance, he said: 'She knew there was something coming for her, yet she did not know how much it was.
'If she made a fresh start for herself in 2007 do you think it makes any sort of common sense to come back three years later. Her family have been distraught, the police have expended so much and she strolls back.'
Ewing, formerly of Bispham, Blackpool, denies the murder of Paige between August 23 and August 27 2007.
He also denies intending to pervert the course of public justice by intimidating witnesses and providing false information to the police in their investigations.
A co-defendant, Gareth Dewhurst, 46, of Duncan Avenue, Blackpool, also denies intending to pervert the course of public justice.
Dewhurst has also pleaded not guilty to sexual penetration of a corpse and not guilty to assisting an offender in disposing of a body.
He is said to have told a 16-year-old boy that Ewing had killed Paige and then made him have sex with her corpse before forcing him to use his car to dispose of her body.
The court previously heardEwing had an 'inappropriate sexual interest' in 15-year-old Paige and took advantage of her 'chaotic and dysfunctional' upbringing which had left her 'very troubled and vulnerable'.
Paige was 15 when she vanished after a row with her father at their seaside home and, despite appeals from police and a 12,000 reward offer from TV chat show host Jeremy Kyle, no trace of her has ever been found.
The trial continues.

'A small bag was found onboard which nobody claimed and the crew therefore decided to contact Copenhagen airport to ask for permission for an emergency landing,' Kristian Aaskov, duty police officer, told Reuters by telephone.
Dr. Ali Genc, a spokesman for Turkish Airlines, said there the Boeing 777 plane had been diverted to Copenhagen 'as a precautionary measure following a possible security alert.'
He said all passengers and cabin crew were safely evacuated to the terminal building. The plane eventually reached New York around four hours behind schedule.
MailOnline Travel has contacted Turkish Airlines for comment and is awaiting a response.
Passengers were forced to return to the airport as the plane was checked by security officials
Back in March a Turkish Airlines flight was forced into an emergency landing after a note with the word 'bomb' was reportedly found in the toilet.
The flight from Istanbul scheduled for Sao Paulo, Brazil touched down in Casablanca, Morocco after declaring an emergency over North Africa.
The airline confirmed the Boeing 777 with the flight number TK15 was carrying 256 people and made a diversion due to a 'bomb threat'.
Only two days earlier, a Turkish Airlines flight out of Istanbul was subject of a bomb threat.
Flight TK-52 from Istanbul to Tokyo was forced to land at Ataturk Airport after the words 'C4-Cargo' were discovered written in the toilet.
The words relate to the plastic explosive C-4.
BGN News reported that the words were discovered by the cabin crew. They alerted the pilot who sent out a signal to make an emergency landing.
After the passengers were evacuated after landing, a full sweep took place involving mobile technology, but no threat was discovered.

        <MainBody>Corey Davison, 11, was left paralysed down one side of his face after life-saving surgery for a brain tumour
It was an operation that saved his life after he was diagnosed with a deadly brain tumour.
But while it was successful, the surgery leftCory Davison with a further devastating problem - paralysis down the side of his face.
The 11-year-old defied the odds to survive a rare and aggressive form ofcancer, diagnosed when he was just six years old.
After a tumour the size of a plum was discovered around Cory's brain stem, he was forced to undergo a delicate seven-hour operation.
During it, surgeons attempted to remove as much of the growth as possible, withoutdamaging his brain.
But while performing the procedure, which ultimately saved his life, medics were forced to cut through delicate nerves, leaving one side of his face paralysed.
For the past four years, Cory, who has a twin called Cain, has lived with the damage surgery caused to his sight, hearing, balance, and  movement in his face.
Now tumour-free and preparing to start high school, Cory, from Blyth, Northumberland, has taken the decision himself to go under the knife again.
On Monday, a team of surgeons will take muscles from his legs and insertthem in his face in the hope that he will regain movement.
His father Steven said the family hoped the surgery,which will last around eight hours, will help Cory have a normal childhood.
The 35-year-old said: 'It was Cory's choice to do this. He's going to highschool in September and obviously he's at an age now where he is consciousabout his looks.

	Alexander Wood, 33, was due at Highbury Magistrates Court, where he is accused of claiming to be the Duke of Marlborough at the luxury Great Northern Hotel in King's Cross.

Officers arrested the man on suspicion of fraud. He was later charged with making off without payment of a sum of 645.60.
The hotel - where a night's stay can cost up to 325 - has refused to comment on the incident.
The alleged con resembles the plot in an episode of Fawlty Towers - the iconic 1970s comedy starring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.
The pilot episode, called 'A Touch of Class', follows Basil as he tries to raise the tone of the hotel as the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.
Basil starts fawning over his Lordship, ignoring the rest of his guests and even cashing dodgy cheques for him, until workers discover the man is actually a fraudster.
The alleged con resembles the plot in the pilot episode of Fawlty Towers - the iconic 1970s comedy starring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty - where a fraudster claimed to bearistocratic Lord Melbury (pictured above)
The Great Northern Hotel was designed by Victorian master builder Lewis Cubitt and first opened its doors in 1854.
It describes itself on its website as 'magnificently refurbished' and the 'finest luxury boutique hotel in London'.
It adds: 'Exquisitely re-designed to evoke all the glamour and grace of this iconic building's extraordinary past, there is no boutique hotel in London more elegant.'
A new hearing date for Wood is yet to be set.
FRAUDSTER CONS BASIL FAWLTY BY POSING AS LORD IN ICONIC SITCOM
The alleged fraud is similar to an episode of theiconic 1970s comedy Fawlty Towers, which starred John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.
The pilot episode, called 'A Touch of Class', follows Basil as he tries to raise the tone of the hotel as the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.
Basil starts fawning over his well-dressed Lordship, ignoring the rest of his guests and even cashing dodgy cheques for him, after becoming infatuated by his air of class.

Polly (right) discovers thatLord Melbury is in fact a fraud and a confidence trickster and breaks the news to Basil and his wife Sybil (centre). The man claiming to be Melbury is  ordered out of the hotel and arrested
However, all is not as it seems and hotel worker Polly Sherman - played by Cleese's real-life ex-wife Connie Booth - discovers thatLord Melbury is in fact a fake.
She makes the discovery after going into Torquay - the town where the comedy is set - and bumping into local policemen who inform her they have been watching Melbury.
He is revealed to be a confidence trickster pulling off a large scam in the town.
Polly later returns to the hotel and informs Basil he has been duped. The fraudster posing as Melbury is frogmarched out of the hotel and later arrested by police.
Fawlty Towers was a BBC sitcom which ran in the 1970s. Only two series - a total of 12 episodes - of the hit-show were ever made, being aired for the first time in 1975 and 1979 respectively.
The series was set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, in the 'English Riviera' of south Devon.
It has previously been named several times as one of the best British television series of all time.

	Aaron Dunford, 22, suffered from chronic nerve pain caused by repeatedly inhaling laughing gas, an inquest heard. His death in Brighton was recorded as a verdict of misadventure.

Mr Dunford said Aaron was just 'a typical lad at university enjoying himself but fell foul to this legal high.'
He said: 'It should be made illegal because it's harming kids.
'It's down to the government who need to make it illegal, it's really doing damage to kids.
'To be honest I didn't have a clue about the drug before but it seems to be a cheap party drug in university towns. Taking it even once may be too much.
'It's a proven fact that kids have died so I don't get why the kids are doing it.'
Time to ban it: Today, the former stepfather of the hospitality and event management graduate called for the government to make use of the drug illegal (file photo)
Mr Dunford added: 'I was not aware that he was taking the drug and I had seen him about four months before he died.
'His younger brothers are devastated. He was a typical lad at university enjoying himself but fell foul to this legal high.
'I've done a bit of research into it and it's so easy to get hold of on the internet.'
Aaron's chronic nerve pain was due to a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by inhaling the dangerous nitrous oxide gas, the inquest heard.

Stephen Dunford, Aaron's former stepfather
According to findings in the Global Drugs Survey,some 15 million people in the UK have inhaled nitrous oxide for feelings of light-headedness and euphoria.
Detective Inspector Mick Jones of Sussex Police, who oversaw the investigation into Aaron's death, said people should think again before taking the drug.
Following the inquest, DI Jones said: 'Anyone considering using this substance in this way should think again.
'The effect of asphyxia through inhalation could happen on the first occasion it is used or after repeated use.
'This tragic case has highlighted that even when it does not result in a fatality that there are longer term effects on your health.
'Despite the deceased being a young man, he was unable to walk down a simple flight of steps due to the chronic pain he had in his knees, which was a direct result of using nitrous oxide gas.'
The University of Brighton student's death was recorded as a verdict of misadventure by asphyxiation, inhalation of nitrous oxide and chronic nerve pain likely due to B12 deficiency caused by chronic use of the gas, Brighton Coroner's Court, East Sussex heard.
Death: Aaron Dunford's chronic nerve pain was due to a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by inhaling the dangerous nitrous oxide gas, the inquest heard. He was found dead at his home in Brighton (pictured)
Nitrous oxide continues to have several legitimate uses, such as numbing pain for dental work, increasing power in engines and food production.
Although not illegal to possess, it can be very dangerous to inhale - not least because it pushes oxygen out of the lungs.
It was responsible for 17 deaths in the UK between 2006 and 2012, according to research from the Royal Alexandra Children's Hospital in Brighton.
And according to the Global Drugs Survey, which quizzed 102,000 people extensively on their use of substances, only Holland inhales more hippy crack than Britain.
Just yesterday at the Glastonbury festival, hundreds of revellers were pictured taking the substance with balloons.
Aaron, originally from East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, died on March 2.

An article on May 27 said that burglar Wayne Bishop had been released early from prison so that he could look after his five children on the grounds that their rights were more important than the rights of his victims. We are happy to make clear that the judgment in fact weighed the childrens rights against the seriousness of Bishops offences and not against the victims rights.
A graphic accompanying a news item published in one edition yesterday wrongly stated that the cost of Prince Harrys 2014 visit to Brazil and Chile was 185,626. In fact, as the article itself stated, the trip cost 85,626.
