LONDON  Three men from the same British family, a recently engaged lifestyle blogger and a couple whose children launched a desperate social media campaign to find them were among those feared killed in the Tunisian beach attack.
Britain's government says at least 15 Britons were among the 38 killed when a university student opened fire Friday at the Sousse beach resort. Officials haven't officially confirmed the names of the victims, but families and friends have released details of those killed to British media. Other families were still fearing the worst Sunday.
Tunisian authorities have said other victims include people from Germany, Ireland, Belgium and Portugal.
Here is a look at some of those believed killed:
___
Joel Richards, a 19-year-old student and active soccer player, was reportedly killed along with his uncle, Adrian Evans, as well as his grandfather, 78-year-old Charles Evans. All three were keen soccer fans who were holidaying together at the beach.
"A young, talented referee with the world at his feet. He was highly thought of and will be sadly missed," Ian Murphy of the Birmingham County Football Association said of Richards. "He was such a talented lad," he added to Sky News.
Another Birmingham-based club, James Connolly's GFC, said Richards was an "exceptionally talented footballer" who represented his club and county on numerous occasions.
Joel's 16-year-old brother, Owen, who was also at the beach, reportedly fled the scene, surviving a bullet wound to his shoulder.
A local council paid tribute to Adrian Evans, 49, described as a popular and long-serving employee who managed gas services.
___
Carly Lovett, 24, was a budding lifestyle blogger on holiday with her fiance Liam Moore.
Lovett, a University of Lincoln graduate and a photographer, had just recently launched a blog sharing her love for beauty products.
The university's school of film and media confirmed Lovett graduated in 2013, and tweeted it was saddened to hear news reports about her.
As friends and fellow bloggers paid tribute to her on social media, a poignant message Lovett wrote on Wednesday is still on Twitter: "Definitely leaving in like three hours and definitely am not finished packing..."
Her fiance was reportedly traveling home.
___
Like others, 23-year-old Conor Fulford turned to social media for help when he became increasingly worried about his missing mother Sue Davey, 44.
Fulford, who thought he may have seen his mother on television as she was being taken away on a stretcher, repeatedly tweeted pleas for information.
So did Ross Nayler, whose father, 42-year-old Scott Chaulkley, was on holiday in Tunisia together with Davey.
"I'm checking Twitter and all the other social media just for anything really, just for any update," Nayler told ITV News.
But by Saturday night, both sons learned the truth. Fulford wrote: "Sorry to tell you we lost my mother Sue Davey tonight." He added: "Love you always Mom, I've got my teddy bear you got me tonight. Rest easy."
Severn Trent Water, where Davey and Chaulkley worked, paid tribute to the pair Sunday. "Sue and Scott had a passion to help others however they could, they cared enormously for all those they worked with and were totally committed to our customers and our company," the company said in a statement.

YEREVAN, Armenia  Demonstrators protesting higher household electricity rates are blocking the Armenian capital's main avenue for a seventh straight day, but they plan to decide Sunday evening whether to call a halt to their protest after the president promised to suspend the rate hikes.
President Serzh Sargsyan announced late Saturday that the government would bear the burden of the higher electricity costs until an international audit of the power company could be done. The protesters claim the Russian-owned utility is riddled with corruption.
Protest organizer Vaghinak Shushanian said Sunday the demonstrators could claim success in battle, if not a complete victory, and it made sense for them to take a break. But he said the decision on whether to halt the protest would be made by the demonstrators in the evening.

KABUL, Afghanistan  An Afghan official says the Islamic State group now has a presence in three provinces but that the government is determined to drive it out.
Zafar Hashimi, the Afghan president's deputy spokesman, said Sunday that the group  which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria  is active in the eastern Nangarhar, western Farah and southern Helmand provinces.
Hashimi says security forces have launched successful operations against the IS group but gave no further details.
The Taliban, which have been at war with the government for nearly 14 years and are also active in the three provinces, have warned the IS group to stay out of the country. Both groups want Islamic rule but the Taliban do not recognize the IS group's self-styled caliphate.

PARIS  French officials say the main suspect in the beheading of a French transportation company manager has admitted to police he carried out the killing that authorities have called a terror attack.
Yassine Salhi, a deliveryman with a history of ties to Islamic extremists, remained in custody Sunday along with his wife and sister.
Security officials say investigators have found no links to any international terror group in the attack Friday. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.
Salhi, arrested Friday, was to be transferred to counterterrorism police headquarters outside Paris. He allegedly crashed a truck into a U.S.-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employer's head on the factory's gate. Officials say he sent a "selfie" of himself and the victim to a Canadian mobile phone number.

BRUSSELS  A bus carrying British schoolchildren has gone off the highway and overturned near the Belgian coast.
The mayor of Middelkerke, Janna Rommel-Opstaele, said one person was killed in the Sunday morning accident on the E-40 highway. The mayor said all of the children survived.
Belgian media said the person killed was an adult accompanying the children and the driver was also reportedly hurt.
Belgian highway authorities said the vehicle apparently went out of control, struck the pillar of a bridge, then shot off the road.
The Flemish broadcasting company VTM said the bus had been carrying 34 children and six adults. Some of the children were taken to Middelkerke to be treated for minor injuries.

ATHENS, Greece  Greece is anxiously awaiting a decision by the European Central Bank on whether to increase the emergency liquidity assistance banks can draw on from the country's central bank.
Worried Greeks on Sunday kept lining up at ATM machines after the prime minister called Saturday for a referendum on creditors' financial proposals in return for rescue loans. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' move has startled Greece's European partners and thrown the country's bailout negotiations with international lenders into turmoil.
If the ECB decides Sunday not to increase the emergency liquidity, which currently stands at just under 90 billion euros ($100 billion), Greece's banks will soon run out of cash and restrictions on transactions will likely be imposed.
Parliament approved Tsipras' referendum call early Sunday, with the national vote set for July 5.

KUWAIT CITY  Kuwaiti authorities are identifying the suicide bomber behind Friday's attack on a Shiite mosque that killed 27 people as a Saudi citizen who flew into the Gulf nation just hours before he blew himself up.
The Interior Ministry on Sunday named the bomber as Fahad Suleiman Abdulmohsen al-Gabbaa and said he was born in 1992, making him 22 or 23 years old.
It said in a statement carried by the official Kuwait News Agency that he arrived on a flight to Kuwait International Airport at dawn Friday.
The ministry said earlier it arrested several suspects, including a Kuwaiti, in connection with the attack.
A local affiliate of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack during midday Friday prayers inside one of Kuwait's oldest Shiite mosques.

ATHENS, Greece  The latest developments on Greece's bailout negotiations:
___
12:25 p.m.
A Greek finance official says the government expects the European Central Bank to continue approving emergency liquidity assistance that Greek banks can draw even after Tuesday, when Greece's international bailout officially expires.
The ECB was expected to meet Sunday to decide what action to take about Greece. The central is bank is under pressure to end that emergency assistance.
A decision by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to call for a national referendum on creditor demands in exchange for bailout loans has thrown Greece's negotiations with its international lenders into turmoil. In response, other nations in the 19-nation eurozone are refusing to extend Greece's bailout program beyond its Tuesday expiration date.
Alternate Greek Finance Minister Nadia Valavani told private Mega television on Sunday "we are expecting the funding of Greek banks to continue normally via the ELA after Tuesday."
Worried Greeks have formed lines at ATM machines all weekend and some machines were running out of cash Sunday morning.
Valavani said the country's banks could see "business as usual" next week if they receive the emergency support "so long as there is calm" and Greeks don't attempt to withdraw all their savings.

BUJUMBURA, Burundi  Witnesses say two people have been killed in overnight attacks that they believe were carried out by Burundian police.
Witnesses in Jabe neighborhood in the nation's capital of Bujumbura, reported intense gunfire Saturday night in an apparent police crackdown on areas seen as hosting anti-government protesters.
Mohamed Masumbuko said his brother, Masumbuko Prime Abdul, was killed in a grenade attack, his "face completely shredded."
Another victim, Patrick Ndikumana, was first hit by a bullet but was killed in a subsequent grenade attack, according to witness Joshua Ngendakumana.
It was not immediately possible to get a comment from the police, who have previously blamed an escalation of violence on protesters opposed to a third term for President Pierre Nkurunziza.
Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place Monday despite the violence.
