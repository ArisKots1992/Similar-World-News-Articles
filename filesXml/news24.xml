Kuwait arrests suspects in mosque attack, mourns dead
Beirut - The Islamic State group has executed more than 3 000 people in Syria, including hundreds of civilians, in the year since it declared its self-described "caliphate", a monitor said on Sunday.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based group monitoring Syria's conflict, said it had documented 3 027 executions by ISIS since June 29 2014.
Among those executed are 1 787 civilians, including 74 children, said the Observatory.
Members of Sunni Shaitat tribe account for around half of the civilians murdered.
ISIS killed 930 members of the clan in Deir Ezzor last year after they rose up against the extremist Sunni Muslim group.
The toll also includes recent mass killings by ISIS in the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane, which the jihadist group re-entered briefly this week after being expelled in January.
The monitor said it had counted at least 223 executions in the border town this week.
The Observatory also documented 216 ISIS executions of rival rebel factions and Kurdish fighters, as well as the executions of nearly 900 regime forces.
ISIS has also executed 143 of its own members it accused of crimes including spying, many of them captured as they were trying to desert the group, the Observatory said.
And at least 8 000 ISIS militants have been killed in battles and US-led air strikes, added the monitor.
ISIS emerged in Syria in 2013, growing from al-Qaeda's one-time Iraq affiliate and initially seeking to merge with al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate al-Nusra Front.
When al-Nusra refused the merger, the two groups become rivals, and ISIS went on to announce its "caliphate" in territory in Syria and Iraq last year, proclaiming its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi "Caliph Ibrahim".

Flash floods kill 41 in western India
Dhaka - At least 23 people have died in flash floods and landslides triggered by heavy rains that lashed southeastern Bangladesh, officials said on Sunday.
Tens of thousands of people were marooned on higher ground as flood waters submerged areas around Cox's Bazar and the hilly district of Bandarban.
Local police official Habibur Rahman confirmed the toll to reporters after four more bodies were recovered from a river on Sunday.
Bangladesh - one of the world's most densely populated countries - is highly vulnerable to natural disasters, including cyclones, droughts, floods and earthquakes.
India, Bangladesh and China are most at risk from river floods, with an increasing number of people threatened because of climate change and economic growth in low-lying regions, a study said in March.

Assad says ISIS has expanded since US air strikes began
Damascus - Mohammed Nasif Khayrbik, a senior Syrian government security official close to President Bashar al-Assad, died on Sunday morning after a long illness, state media said.
Khayrbik was a key confidante of the Assad family and the target of EU and US sanctions for his alleged role in putting down anti-government demonstrations and interfering in neighbouring Lebanon.
"The presidency announces the death this morning of retired general Mohammed Nasif Khayrbik, deputy vice-president of the republic, after a long illness," Syrian state television said.
Khayrbik's ties to Syria's ruling family go back to the days of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father and predecessor as president.
Khayrbik was an advisor to him, and oversaw ties with Iran, and well as US-Syrian relations.
He remained close to the presidential palace after Bashar al-Assad succeeded his father, and in the 1990s served as chief of the country's internal security.
In 2005, he was named vice-president for security affairs.
In 2007, he was targeted by US sanctions for allegedly aiding efforts by Damascus "to undermine Lebanese democracy".
And in May 2011, after security forces moved to put down protests against Assad's regime, Khayrbik was among the officials added to an EU travel ban and asset freeze list.

        <MainBody>Episcopal Church elects first black presiding bishop
2015-06-28 14:10
Salt Lake City - The Episcopal Church elected its first African-American presiding bishop, choosing Bishop Michael Curry of North Carolina during the denomination's national assembly on Saturday. He will now lead a nearly 1.9 million-member denomination known for its history as the faith home of many of the US presidents.
The New York-based Episcopal Church is the US body of the Anglican Communion, an 80-million member worldwide fellowship of churches with roots in the Church of England.
Curry was elected in a vote by bishops at the Episcopal General Convention, the top legislative body of the church. Curry won in a landslide, earning 121 votes. The other three candidates had 21 votes or less. The decision was affirmed on a vote of 800-12 by the House of Deputies.
Curry will succeed Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, who will complete her nine-year term on 1 November. She was the first female presiding bishop and the first woman to lead an Anglican national church.
Curry, 62, has been bishop of North Carolina since 2000. He is known for his emphasis on evangelism, public service and social justice.
"This is beautiful," said Norberto "Bert" Jones, 65, a lay deputy and African American. "God works awesome wonders, man. We're getting to that point of understanding that it's not about color and culture, but what you bring to the table. "
Curry takes charge at a time when fewer Americans are formally affiliating with a particular religious group, contributing to steady membership declines in the Episcopal Church and other liberal Protestant groups.
Membership in the Episcopal Church has dropped by 18% over the last decade.
Next week, the convention will vote on eliminating gender-specific language from church laws on marriage so religious weddings can also be performed for same-sex couples. Clergy could decline to perform the ceremonies.

Police release 1 of 4 suspects held over France attack
Paris - The man suspected of decapitating his boss in an attack on a gas factory in France has confessed to the grisly crime, sources close to the investigation said on Sunday.
Yassin Salhi, 35, "has also given details about the circumstances" surrounding the killing, according to the sources, who said he would be transferred to Paris for further questioning later Sunday by anti-terrorist police.
Salhi's confession came after it emerged the married father-of-three sent a gruesome selfie photo of himself and the severed head to a WhatsApp number in Canada.
Investigators have warned however that it could be a relay number and the intended recipient could be anywhere in the world.
After several hours of silence, Salhi has begun to open up to investigators about the assault, which came six months after 17 were killed in Islamist attacks in Paris that began with the Charlie Hebdo massacre.
On Friday morning, Salhi rammed his van into the US-owned Air Products factory near France's second city of Lyon in what President Francois Hollande said was a "terrorist" attack designed to blow up the whole building.
He was overpowered by a firefighter as he was trying to prise open a bottle of acetone in an apparent suicidal bid to destroy the factory.
Police then made the grisly discovery of the severed head of Salhi's boss, 54-year-old Herve Cornara, lashed to the gates of the factory near two flags on which were written the Muslim profession of faith.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls repeated that the world was engaged in a "war against terrorism".
"We cannot lose this war because it's fundamentally a war of civilisation. It's our society, our civilisation that we are defending," Valls told iTELE rolling news channel.
France is facing "a major terrorist threat" which needs to be fought "over the long-term", warned the prime minister.
It's not a question of whether there will be another attack, but "when" and "where", stressed Valls.
Day of bloodshed
Friday's attack came on a day of bloodshed on three continents that saw 38 people mown down on a Tunisian beach and 26 killed in a suicide attack in Kuwait.
The Islamic State extremist group has claimed responsibility for those two attacks but no group has said it carried out the French operation.
Sources close to the investigation said Salhi was radicalised more than a decade ago after contact with Muslim convert Frederic Jean Salvi - known as "Ali" - who is suspected of preparing attacks in Indonesia with al-Qaeda militants.
An autopsy on the victim has proved inconclusive, with experts unable to determine whether he was killed before being beheaded or decapitated alive.
The French probe is naturally focusing on Syria, where hundreds of people from France have gone to wage jihad, officials said.
Anti-terrorist authorities have identified 473 people who have left France to fight in Iraq or Syria and Valls said 1,800 people in France were "linked" in some way to the jihadist cause.
'Being here, together'
Nearly six months after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the attack raised painful memories for France, which is still on high alert for potential repeats.
Around 200 people in the town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier - where the attack took place - staged a minute's silence in the victim's honour followed by a rousing and spontaneous rendition of the French national anthem.
One man, Philippe Ouastani, said he came to show solidarity with the victim. "It's unheard of to decapitate someone in the 21st century. What weapons do we have to combat that? Being here, together."
Another woman, wearing the Muslim headscarf, said she was "unable to speak" when she heard the news.
"These acts have got nothing to do with religion. The Prophet never said to kill innocent people," raged the woman, who asked to remain anonymous.
Trying to find the words to explain the killing to her 4-year-old son, she said: "There are naughty people who have done bad things. The police will put them in prison to punish them for their silly, silly actions."
Like the Charlie Hebdo attackers and Islamist Mohamed Merah who gunned down soldiers and Jewish children in the southwest city of Toulouse in 2012, Salhi had been known to French security services for "radicalisation" but slipped through the net.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Friday Salhi had been investigated for links to radical Salafists in Lyon, but was not known to have participated in terrorist activities and did not have a criminal record.
Europe has for months been bracing for so-called "lone wolf" attacks by supporters of Islamic State, which has urged its followers to strike wherever they can.
France, which has the highest Muslim population in Europe, last week passed a controversial new spying law granting sweeping powers to snoop on citizens.

In a statement carried by the official KUNA news agency, the ministry identified the attacker as Fahd Suleiman Abdulmohsen al-Qaba'a.
IS claimed the Friday attack, which killed 26 and wounded 227 worshippers at the Al-Imam Al-Sadeq mosque in Kuwait City.

Nearly 200 injured amid fire explosion in Taiwan
Taipei - Witnesses described the scene at a Taiwan water park as "hell" after a ball of fire ripped through a crowd, with authorities putting the number of injured at more than 500 on Sunday, almost 200 of them seriously.
The number of those injured in the blast late Saturday, which came as coloured powder being sprayed on the partygoers ignited, more than doubled as authorities began to track down victims who had taken themselves to hospital or been ferried there by others.
Horrifying amateur video footage showed crowds of young revellers dancing in front of a stage and cheering as clouds of green and yellow powder covered them at the "colour party".
But their joy turned to terror when the powder suddenly erupted into flames engulfing them in an inferno as they ran screaming for their lives.
Some were dressed only in swimwear and images from the scene show many with severe burns being tended by those who escaped.
One male student who sustained minor injuries described the scene as "hell".
"There was blood everywhere, including in the pool where lots of the injured were soaking themselves for relief from the pain," he told reporters.
His visibly shaken girlfriend added: "I saw lots of people whose skin was gone."
Ambulances had struggled to reach the scene, and victims were carried away on rubber rings and inflatable dinghies as friends desperately tried to get them out.
Bystanders poured bottles of water on the scorched skin of the injured. Trails of bloody footprints leading away from the stage remained.
Around 1 000 spectators had been at the Color Play Asia event at the Formosa Fun Coast water park, just outside the capital Taipei, according to officials.
One male witness told local news channel CTI: "It started on the left side of the stage. At the beginning I thought it was part of the special effects of the party but then I realised there was something wrong and people started screaming and running."
Lee Lih-jong, deputy chief of the health bureau of the New Taipei City government, said 519 people had been injured with 190 of them seriously hurt.
The severely wounded are being treated in intensive care units at 37 different hospitals.
"The reason why the burns were so severe was that in addition to burns to the skin, there were also injuries caused by burns to the respiratory organs from the large amount of colour powder inhaled," Lee told AFP.
"The next 24 hours will be critical for those severely injured."
Young victims
One father broke down as he told how his daughter was in intensive care with third degree burns.
"She was attending a music concert... why would there be an explosion?" he wept bewildered.
"More than 80% of her body has been scorched," he told reporters.
The man, who was not named, lashed out at authorities saying they had not contacted him or offered any help.
The health bureau's Lee said details of the ages of the victims were not yet available, "but all looked very young, in their 20s or even younger".
Media reports said some victims had suffered burns to more than 40 percent of their bodies.
"Our initial understanding is this explosion and fire... was caused by the powder spray. It could have been due to the heat of the lights on the stage," said a spokesman for the New Taipei City fire department.
Deputy fire chief Chen Chung-yueh said Sunday the blast may have been caused by "sparks from machinery or lighting equipment".
Five people including event manager Lu Chung-chi were detained by police.
They are now being questioned by prosecutors on charges of offences against public safety and negligence of duties that caused severe injuries, a police spokesman said.
Color Play Asia has also run other "colour parties" in Taiwan in the past two years.
Taiwan's premier Mao Chih-kuo, who visited the injured Sunday, ordered that all such events be banned unless their safety could be assured.

Washington - One man died and eight other people were rescued on Saturday after their boat went over a dam in the state of Maryland, US media reported.
The incident on Lake Linganore left four people desperately hanging onto the dam for their lives, NBC news said, citing Frederick County Fire and Rescue Services Division Captain Kevin Fox.
The four were rescued, along with three more who were pulled from the dam's spillway by helicopter and another who was pulled out by boat.
Maryland Department of Natural Resources Police said the 62-year-old victim's body had been recovered after becoming trapped underwater by the force of the dam, according to NBC.
Fox told ABC News that residents heard people calling for help and reported the incident around 18:30 (22:30 GMT).
The cause of the accident was unknown but occurred amid heavy flooding.
Lake Linganore is located around 72km northwest of Washington.

Saudi Arabia says it has shot down Scud missile
Riyadh - A Saudi soldier was killed in a rocket attack on the kingdom's border with Yemen, where Riyadh is leading an air war against Iran-backed rebels, the interior ministry said.
The rocket fire in the southern city of Jazan killed Faisal Mohammed Belqasem Maqaadi and wounded another soldier, an interior ministry spokesman said in a statement carried by the official SPA news agency late on Saturday.
It did not specify the source of the fire but cross-border shelling by Yemeni rebels has become common since Riyadh launched an air campaign against them in late March.
At least 44 people, civilians and troops, have now lost their lives in shelling and skirmishes along the Saudi side of the border since the campaign began.
Last week, three Saudi soldiers and an Emirati were killed in the border area.

Kuwait says security raised to highest after attack
Kuwait City - Kuwaiti police have arrested the driver who transported a suicide bomber to a Shi'ite mosque where he blew himself up, killing 26 and injuring 227 in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group, official media reported.
Authorities have also detained the owner of the house where the bomber was staying, a Kuwaiti national who subscribes to "fundamentalist and deviant ideology", the KUNA news agency said, citing a statement from the Interior Ministry.
The driver, named as Abdulrahman Sabah Eidan Saud, was described as an "illegal resident" born in 1989, who took the bomber to the Al-Imam Al-Sadeq mosque in Kuwait City on Friday, it said.
The arrest came after thousands of Kuwaitis braved scorching summer heat on Saturday to attend the funerals of 18 out of 26 victims of the bombing, claimed by the Islamic State group.
The bodies of the remaining eight victims were flown to Iraq's Shiite holy city of Najaf for burial, State Minister for Cabinet Affairs Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah Al-Sabah said.
Draped in Kuwaiti flags, the bodies were borne by mourners chanting religious slogans.
Mourners turned out in large numbers despite the Ramadan daylight fast and as temperatures hit 45 degrees Celsius.
"This crowd is the proof that the objectives of the criminal act have failed," parliament speaker Marzouk al-Ghanem told reporters.
The mourners, who included women clad in black Islamic dress, carried Kuwaiti flags and black and green banners bearing religious slogans.
The health ministry said that 40 wounded are still in hospital following the attack, one of the country's worst bombings and its first ever on a mosque.
The interior ministry said authorities will "continue efforts to uncover the conspirators in this criminal act and to reveal all of the information and circumstances behind it".
Sunni solidarity
Two of the dead were Iranian, the Shi'ite-dominated Islamic republic's foreign ministry said.
In Iraq, relatives wept as the eight coffins arrived and were taken inside the airport terminal at Najaf, an AFP journalist said.
"We want to deliver a message to Daesh (an Arabic acronym for IS) that we are united brothers among the Sunnis and Shiites, and they cannot divide us," Abdulfatah al-Mutawwia, a Kuwaiti who lost his brother in the bombing, said in Iraq.
Friday's attack targeted Al-Imam Al-Sadeq mosque in Kuwait City during Friday noon prayers.
Mosque official Abdulnabi Mansur said the victims flown to Iraq were seven Kuwaitis and a Saudi, and that they would be buried in the Wadi al-Salam cemetery surrounding the shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf.
In Kuwait, condolences were being accepted for three days from Saturday at the Grand Mosque, the largest place of worship for Sunni Muslims, in a show of solidarity.
Kuwait's emir, the government, parliament and political groups and clerics have all said the attack aimed to stir up sectarian strife in the emirate.
The radical Sunni group Islamic State considers Shiites to be heretics.
Shi'ites comprise a third of Kuwait's 1.3 million native population. Sunni religious and political groups were quick to condemn the attack.
The emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who visited the site immediately after the bombing, said the "criminal attack is a desperate and evil attempt targeting Kuwait's national unity".
Countries and organisations including the United Nations and the United States deplored the bombing.
Eight Islamist, liberal and Shi'ite political groups condemned the attack in a joint statement and called on the government to confront extremists.
Security measures
The government had briefed MPs about measures it has taken since the bombing, Sheikh Mohammad told reporters.
An interior ministry statement said, without elaborating, that an unspecified number of suspects were held for questioning in connection with the attack.
The cabinet announced after an emergency meeting on Friday that all security agencies and police had been put on alert to confront what it called "black terror".
Justice and Islamic Affairs Minister Yacoub al-Sane said additional security measures will be taken around mosques and places of worship.
National oil conglomerate Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) said on Saturday it had raised security at oil facilities to maximum level.
Oil is Kuwait's main source of income, accounting for around 90 percent of public revenues.
The OPEC member says it sits on around 10% of global reserves and pumps around 2.8 million barrels of oil per day.

Nearly 200 injured amid fire explosion in Taiwan
Taipei - The number of people injured in a fire at a Taiwan water amusement park rose to 516 on Sunday, government officials said, with more than 180 still in intensive care.
Media reported four mainland Chinese and two foreigners were among those injured after Saturday's fire, during a party where up to 1 000 revellers were sprayed with coloured powder as they danced to music, seeking to escape the summer heat.
The blaze, which broke out around 20:30 at the Formosa Fun Coast water park on the outskirts of the capital, Taipei, is suspected to have been caused by an explosion of the powder, local government official Lin Chieh-yu told Reuters.
"It remains under investigation as to what made the powder explode," he added, however.
Authorities have banned the use of the powder until the investigation is completed.
"The next few days will be a critical time for the injured," Taiwan Premier Mao Chi-kuo told reporters, adding that 410 people were still in hospital on Sunday, with 194 being treated for serious injuries.
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, rescuers treated hundreds of people, most of them aged between 20 and 30, wearing wet swimsuits and lying on inflatable plastic doughnuts. Television showed images of people running from sky-high flames.
"There was blood and people were on fire," one injured man said.
No death has yet been reported, but victims of the incident suffered burns to the limbs, with some passing out from the pain while others had burned clothes stuck to their skin, media reports and pictures showed.
"She is young. A student," sobbed the father of an 18-year-old girl with burns on 80% of her body, according to television footage.
Soldiers, army vehicles and medical services joined the rescue effort, while hospitals in four municipal precincts, along with Taipei, are treating sufferers.
"We are very sorry about what happened and we will investigate the cause to find out who is responsible," Eric Chu, the mayor of New Taipei City, where the park is located, said on Saturday, adding that it had been ordered to shut down.
The amusement park has been closed temporarily, it said on its website on Sunday.
Taipei has sweltered in temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius in recent weeks.

San Francisco - Police say a bystander has been shot at a gay pride event in San Francisco when an argument between several young men turned violent.
Officer Carlos Manfredi says several people were detained for questioning after the shooting on Saturday evening.
The shooting triggered a chaotic scene as dozens of people ran screaming as officers carrying handguns rushed to the scene.
Manfredi says a 64-year-old man who was caught in the crossfire got shot in the arm. He was hospitalised in a stable condition.
Four shots were heard in a witness video posted online.
Manfredi says the argument had nothing to do with the gay pride event.
A concert that was part of the weekend-long gay pride celebration across the city was ending around the time of the shooting.

1st funerals set for Charleston church shooting victims
Charleston - Funerals for three more victims of a deadly shooting during a Bible study group in South Carolina were being held Saturday at the church where they were slain.
Services were first held for 54-year-old Cynthia Hurd at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, 11 days after a gunman entered the church and killed her and eight other people - all African-Americans. Police contend the attack was racially motivated.
Hurd, a long-time Charleston librarian, will be remembered as a tireless public servant and loving family member, speakers at her funeral said. Attendees included South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, US Senator Tim Scott and the Reverend Jesse Jackson, a leading civil rights activist.
"Her death will lead to change and Cynthia Hurd will be helping millions," said Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley Jr during a eulogy.
Riley remembered Hurd as a young girl serving ice cream. She went from serving people ice cream, he said, "to leading them to knowledge," as a librarian for almost 30 years.
Funerals for Tywanza Sanders, 26, and Susie Jackson, 87, were to take place at the church later in the day.
Obama eulogy
The funerals follow one on Friday for another victim, the Reverend Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor, whose eulogy was delivered in person by President Barack Obama.
Obama sang a hymn of hope and spoke with the fervour of a preacher as he eulogized Pinckney, and minced no words in calling for an end to racial injustice and gun violence in the United States. Obama suddenly began singing the hymn "Amazing Grace," quickly joined by ministers and some of the thousands who packed into the arena at the College of Charleston in South Carolina.
The nation's first black president called for gun control and efforts to eliminate poverty and job discrimination, and said the Confederate battle flag  long a symbol of Southern pride  must be removed from places of honour.
"For many  black and white  that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now," he said during Pinckney's funeral.
Hours later, a woman was arrested early on Saturday on the grounds of the South Carolina Capitol in Columbia after scaling a flagpole to rip down a Confederate flag that flew at the Statehouse. Bree Newsome, 30, was arrested immediately afterward.
She and James Ian Tyson, 30, also of Charlotte, face misdemeanour charges in the incident.
The Confederate flag was carried by forces supporting the secessionist, pro-slavery southern states during the American Civil War.

Taipei - About 200 people were injured after a fire suspected to have stemmed from the explosion of an unknown flammable powder occurred in a recreational park in northern Taiwan, local media reported on Saturday.
The fire broke out at the centre of the stage when up to 1 000 people were having a colour play party - a festival of dance and music where revellers are sprayed with clouds of coloured powder. Footage from TV stations showed flames reaching into the sky with some people running to escape.
"178 people that have been injured have been sent to hospitals nearby. We are very sorry about what happened and we will investigate the cause to find out who is responsible," New Taipei City mayor Eric Chu told reporters.
"We have demanded the park shut down immediately for inspection," he said.
The number of injured could rise, local media said.

The Holland America Line cruise ship Westerdam sits in dock in Ketchikan, Alaska. Officials say eight passengers on an excursion off the ship and a pilot were in a plane that was found crashed against the granite rock face of a cliff northeast of Ket
Last MH17 crash remains arrive in Netherlands
Juneau - A recovery crew reached a remote site in southeast Alaska where a sightseeing plane crashed, killing all nine people aboard.
Chris John of the Ketchikan Volunteer Rescue Squad said on Friday that the aircraft was sitting at a steep angle and three members from his organization had to secure it so they could safely work to recover the bodies.
Eight cruise ship passengers and the pilot died when the DeHavilland DHC-3 Otter turboprop went down on Thursday in Misty Fjords National Monument near Ketchikan.
The cause of the crash remained under investigation.
Authorities tentatively identified the victims as Hal Cheney, 71, and Mary Doucette, 59, of Lodi, California; Glenda Cambiaso, 31, and Hugo Cambiaso, 65, of North Potomac, Maryland; June Kranenburg, 73, and Leonard Kranenburg, 63, of Medford, Oregon; Margie Apodaca, 63, and Raymond Apodaca, 70, of Sparks, Nevada; and the pilot, Bryan Krill, 64 of Hope, Idaho.
The plane crashed on a cliff above a lake in steep, muddy and slippery terrain, John said. The fuselage was largely intact but the wings and tail were separated or heavily deformed, he said.
On Thursday, the Coast Guard received a report that the plane was overdue. An emergency locator transmitter activated and a helicopter pilot later spotted the downed aircraft.
Wind and rain prevented any recovery on Thursday. Winds were not a concern on Friday but there was cloud cover.
A National Transportation Safety Board team was assembled to investigate the crash. Plans were being made to take them to the site on Saturday, John said.
Ketchikan-based airline Promech Air operated the shore excursion offered through Holland America Line. The eight passengers were travelling on the Westerdam on a seven-day cruise that had departed Seattle last Saturday.
"We are incredibly distressed by this situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with those onboard the plane and their families," Holland America said in a statement.
The airline echoed those sentiments.
"There is nothing I can say that can alleviate the pain and overwhelming sense of loss that we and the loved ones of those affected are feeling," Marcus Sessoms, president of Promech Air, said in a statement.
The ship left Ketchikan on Thursday night and was expected back in Seattle on Saturday.
Promech's website advertises tours of the more than 7 770-square-kilometre Misty Fjord National Monument in its floatplanes.
"Towering granite cliffs, 1 000-foot waterfalls, lush and remote valleys and serene crystalline lakes make up this incredible landscape," it says.

White House condemns France, Tunisia, Kuwait attacks
Kuwait - Thousands of people in Kuwait took part in a mass funeral procession on Saturday for 27 people killed in a suicide bombing that targeted a Shi'ite mosque a day earlier.
Police in Kuwait said they are interrogating a number of suspects with possible links to the suicide bombing, which was claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
An Interior Ministry statement on Saturday said police arrested the owner of the car that was used by the bomber to drive to the Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait City, where he detonated his device inside among the worshippers. Police did not say how many suspects are being interrogated.
The bombing, which also wounded more than 200 male worshippers who were taking part in midday Friday prayers, was the first terrorist attack in Kuwait in more than two decades.
The government helped plan Saturday's mass funeral for those killed. Thousands of Sunnis and Shiites from across the country took part in the procession and prayer at Kuwait's Grand Mosque. Many carried the Kuwaiti flag; others a simple black flag to signify mourning. Some in the crowd chanted, "Sunnis and Shi'ites are brothers!"
Sunni groups in Kuwait and leaders from across the Middle East have strongly condemned the attack, which Gulf officials say is aimed at provoking a backlash from Shiites and sparking sectarian war. More than a third of Kuwait's 1.2 million citizens are believed to be Shi'ite. The majority of Kuwaitis are Sunni Muslims.
Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al-Hamad Al-Sabah was quoted in the official Kuwait News Agency describing the bombing as "grotesque" and vowing to "cut the evil hand" that tampers with the country's security.
The news agency also carried a statement from Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, extending his condolences to the families of the victims.

Fontaines-Sur-Saone - Officials say the top suspect in the beheading of a French businessman took a "selfie" photo with the slain victim and sent the image to at least one recipient.
Two French officials said authorities were working to confirm the identity of the recipient, but were not able to immediately confirm media reports that it was sent to an unspecified person in Syria.
On Friday, key suspect Yassine Salhi allegedly crashed a truck into an US-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employer's severed head on a factory gate in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier  in what authorities are calling a terror attack.
He was arrested and remained in police custody on Saturday.
Authorities noted the similarity to tactics used by the Islamic State group, though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Serbian church blasts gays over parade plan
Berlin - Several hundred thousand people filled the streets of Berlin for the city's Gay Pride parade on Saturday, a day after the US Supreme Court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide.
The crowds were a riot of colour under grey skies, with many demonstrators in costume - including US embassy staffer Tim Standaert, who painted his torso blue with an enormous red heart as he waved a rainbow-hued Stars and Stripes flag.
"We are all different, we are all the same," was the theme of this year's march, which comes a day after the landmark Supreme Court ruling that all 50 US states must carry out and recognise same-sex marriages.
Germany introduced civil unions for gay and lesbian couples in 2001, but they do not have the right to marry and are still also forbidden from jointly adopting children.
Earlier this month the upper house of the German parliament adopted a resolution calling for the legalisation of same-sex marriage, which is opposed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
Saturday's pride march was a typically festive affair, with lashings of sequins, fake eyelashes, wigs and feather boas, rainbow flags, and even one reveller who appeared to have dipped his penis in gold paint.
"A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine," read one placard that seemed especially fitting for the miserable weather.
The parade came as tens of thousands of revellers also gathered in Dublin for the Irish capital's pride event, a month after that country became the first in the world to vote by referendum in favour of legalising gay marriage.

French PM warns of more attacks after man decapitated
Paris - French police were grilling a suspected Islamist Saturday about an attack in which the man displayed his boss's severed head, in what appeared to be the second jihadist attack in France this year.
Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who cut short an official trip to South America to rush home, warned France faced more attacks and that Friday's assault on a gas factory near the second city of Lyon would increase tensions in the country, putting citizens' resilience "to the test".
No jihadist group has claimed Friday's attack, which came on the same day as a massacre at a Tunisian beach resort in which 38 people were gunned down and a suicide bombing in Kuwait that killed 26.
The other two attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State group.
Suspect Yassin Salhi, a 35-year-old married father-of-three, was arrested after causing an explosion by driving a delivery van into a warehouse containing bottles of dangerous gas and chemicals at the US-owned Air Products factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, some 40km from Lyon.
The prosecutor in the case said firefighters overpowered Salhi as he was trying to open acetone bottles in what is believed to have been an attempt to cause a larger explosion.
The firefighters then discovered the decapitated body of his 54-year-old boss Herve Cornara - who ran a delivery firm - near the car, along with a knife.
Cornara's head was pinned to a nearby fence.
"The head was surrounded by two Islamic flags bearing the Shahada, the profession of [the Muslim] faith," said prosecutor Francois Molins.
'Unable to speak'
Authorities hope an autopsy, expected to be carried out later on Saturday, will offer more clues. A source close to the case said it would seek to determine if the victim was first killed before being decapitated.
Meanwhile, in the town of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, shocked residents held a minute's silence, followed by a pulsating rendition of France's national anthem.
One man, Philippe Ouastani, said he turned out in solidarity with the victim. "It's unheard of to decapitate someone in the 21st century. What weapons do we have to combat that? Being here, together."
Another woman, wearing the Muslim headscarf, said she was "unable to speak" when she heard the news.
"These acts have got nothing to do with religion. The Prophet never said to kill innocent people," raged the woman, who requested to remain anonymous.
She tried to find words to explain the killing to her 4-year-old son.
"There are naughty people who have done bad things. The police will put them in prison to punish them for their silly, silly actions," she told him.
'Better armed'
The gory attack in France came nearly six months after a three-day Islamist killing spree in Paris left 17 people dead, most of them gunned down in the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Like the Charlie Hebdo attackers and Islamist Mohamed Merah who gunned down soldiers and Jewish children in the southwest city of Toulouse in 2012, Salhi had been known to security services for "radicalisation", but slipped through the cracks.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Friday that Salhi had been investigated for links to radical Salafists in Lyon, but was not identified as having participated in terrorist activities and did not have a criminal record.
Speaking after a ministerial meeting on Saturday with President Francois Hollande, Cazeneuve vowed the government would "continue to work relentlessly" against terrorism.
France is on high alert over hundreds of citizens who have gone to wage jihad in Iraq and Syria, as well as those involved in recruitment or radicalisation online.
Similarly, Europe has for months been bracing for so-called "lone wolf" attacks by supporters of Islamic State, which has urged its followers to strike wherever they can.
High threat
Cazeneuve outlined measures taken by the government in recent months to face "a threat which has never been as high" such as the creation of hundreds of new jobs for police, gendarmes and intelligence agents.
Some $256m will also go to modernising surveillance methods to keep track of jihadists online.
Earlier this week, France passed a controversial new spying law granting sweeping powers to snoop on citizens.
Cazeneuve said the law allowed security services to be "better armed" to fight the jihadist threat
Valls warned Friday's attack would fuel tensions in France - home to Western Europe's largest Muslim population - that "will be exploited".
"This macabre act of decapitation, staged with flags, is new in France" and aimed at "making an impact," Valls said.
"It's difficult for a society to live for years under the threat of attack," he told AFP on a flight back from Colombia.
"The question is not... if there will be another attack, but when."
