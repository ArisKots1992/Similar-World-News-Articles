Chinese man crashes balloon near disputed isles
Istanbul - A Turkish medical official says that 18 tourists were hospitalised after a hot air balloon accident in the Cappadocia area of central Turkey.
District medical director Dr Rahim Unlubay says that none of the tourists is in a critical situation. Nine have already been released from the hospital and he expects the rest to be released soon.
He confirmed Turkish media reports that there were foreigners among the injured Friday.
Turkish news agency DHA say the hot air balloon went down after being buffeted by winds and hitting an electrical wire.
Anadolu news agency says that 14 of the tourists were Chinese, two were American, one was Brazilian, two were Greeks and one was Turkish. It is not immediately clear which among them was injured.

Charleston shooting: 4 000 pay respects to slain pastor
Charleston - President Barack Obama was on Friday set to deliver a eulogy for the chief pastor gunned down in an apparent racially-motivated attack that shocked the nation.
Obama will deliver the remarks for pastor Clementa Pinckney, who was gunned down along with eight other African Americans during Bible study in a historic church nine days ago.
The shooting was allegedly carried out by Dylann Roof, aged 21, a white supremacist.
The carnage renewed discussions of racism and hate groups in America and led to a furor over the controversial Confederate flag, which is present throughout the south but that many see as a symbol of racism.
For Obama, the shooting touched a particular nerve because it overlapped with two thorny issues in his presidency: gun control, which he never managed to overhaul, and racial divides.
Soon after the killings, a frustrated and angry Obama condemned the country's lack of action over mass shootings.
Several thousand people, including Vice President Joe Biden, are expected at the ceremony at a university in Charleston near the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church where the shooting took place.
Mourners held the first funeral services Thursday for some of the nine African Americans killed.
Hundreds filed past the open coffin of Ethel Lance, aged 70, at a funeral home in North Charleston, ahead of an afternoon service for Sharonda Singleton, aged 45.
Emotions ran high at the Royal Missionary Baptist Church as friends and relatives bid a final farewell to Lance, a custodian at a Charleston arts center.
"I am here to tell you that we are stronger because we are together as a community," Reverend Norvel Goff told the mourners, the local Post and Courier newspaper reported.
Lance was later laid to rest at the Emanuel cemetery, where her children and grandchildren kissed her coffin and well-wishers threw roses into her grave.
Singleton, a speech pathologist, high school track coach and pastor at Emanuel, was remembered by a capacity crowd at the 2 000-seat Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church.
"She believed she could change every child," said South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who attended both funeral services.
Seen in the pews were Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, two of the most recognizable civil rights activists in the United States today.
Thousands pay respects
On Wednesday, thousands filed past Pinckney's open coffin at the South Carolina legislature in the state capital Columbia, where he had served as a senator.
Services for the other victims are scheduled throughout the weekend and into next week.
Meanwhile, the campaign against the Confederate battle flag flying outside the South Carolina legislature picked up steam.
Adding his voice to the movement was College of Charleston president Glenn McConnell, a former Republican lieutenant governor and avid Civil War battle re-enactor.
As a state senator, McConnell favored positioning the flag alongside a Confederate memorial on the State House grounds 15 years ago.
"Today is a different time," he said, adding that the flag should come down as a "statement of courtesy and goodwill to all those who may be offended by it."
Some revere the Civil War-era flag as an emblem of Southern heritage, but others condemn it as a symbol of racial hatred and white supremacy.
Roof's getaway car, he was arrested a day after the shooting in North Carolina bore a Confederate license plate, and photos later emerged online of him brandishing the flag together with a handgun. He reportedly hoped to trigger a race war with the shooting.
South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a Republican with Tea Party support, has come out in favor of removing the flag, but the final decision hinges on a vote by the state legislature.
Proliferation of petitions
MoveOn.org, a left-leaning campaign group, said more than 600 000 people have signed more than 50 petitions hosted on its website against the flag.
In Washington, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said it was too early to say whether Roof will face federal civil rights charges.
A hate crimes investigation is unfolding, she said, but "it's simply premature at this point to be able to announce" how Roof might be charged.
South Carolina has charged Roof with nine counts of murder, one for each victim. He remains in solitary confinement at a North Charleston jail.
Haley has said that she favors the death penalty for Roof if he is convicted.

Dubai - A suicide bomber blew himself up at a Kuwaiti Shi'ite Muslim mosque in Kuwait city during Friday prayers, wounding at least eight people, Kuwaiti newspaper al-Jarida said on social media.
The newspaper said the attack targeted Imam al-Sadeq Mosque in the Sawaber district.
"Eight casualties have been taken to the Emiri hospital, two in critical condition," al-Jarida said on its Twitter feed, without giving a source.
Arab television stations al-Arabiya and Al Jazeera earlier reported that an explosion hit the mosque and caused several casualties.

Brussels - Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to President Francois Hollande on Friday to convey his sympathies over what a British government source said appeared to be an appalling incident at a gas factory in France.
"The Prime Minister has just spoken to President Hollande to express his sympathies for what looks like an appalling incident there," the source said.
"It clearly looks an extremely concerning situation and our thoughts are with all those affected by it."

Italy rescues 4 500 migrants, 10 die
Brussels - Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi launched a furious broadside at fellow EU leaders on Thursday for failing to help deal with a tide of Mediterranean migrants, sources said.
"If that's your idea of Europe, you can keep it," Renzi told his 27 counterparts at a European Union summit in Brussels, Italian sources told AFP.
"Either give us solidarity or don't waste our time," they quoted him as saying.
Renzi lashed out after the EU leaders at the summit failed to reach a consensus on mandatory quotas for migrants who land in frontline states like Italy, Greece and Malta.
They rejected European Commission proposals that 40 000 Syrian and Eritrean asylum-seekers who have already arrived in Europe should be redistributed according to a compulsory system.
"If you don't want to take the 40 000 you are not fit to be called Europe," added Renzi.
More than 100,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean so far this year, most of them landing in Italy, Greece and Malta who say their EU peers should share more of the burden.
The EU held an emergency summit on April 23 after around 800 migrants died when their boat sank in one of the worst disasters of its kind in the Mediterranean.
Renzi's comments came after an Italian mayor on the frontline of the crisis said failing to provide asylum seekers with safe passage to the EU was tantamount to genocide.
Tensions erupted between Italy and France recently over a crisis that saw hundreds of refugees blocked at the border between the two countries.

Dozens to speak at Boston bomber's sentencing
Boston - Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev arrived at the US Penitentiary in Florence, Colorado, on Thursday, a day after he was sentenced to death.
A spokesperson for the US Department of Justice confirmed that Tsarnaev was being held at the high-security facility.
The penitentiary is in the same prison complex as the ADX, a Supermax prison, but is a different institution.
After a judge formally imposed a jury's recommendation of the death penalty on Wednesday, Assistant US Attorney William Weinreb said Tsarnaev is eventually expected to go to the death row unit at the US Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana.
Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh was also put to death at the facility, and more than 50 other people are awaiting execution.
Tsarnaev could spend years or even decades there as his appeal makes its way through the court system.

Paris - French police are searching for a second man after arresting one man following a suspected Islamist attack on a chemical factory in the south-east of the country, a local newspaper reports.
A helicopter is sweeping the area around the Air Products factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier after the attackers drove a car onto the site, ramming gas tanks and causing an explosion and a fire, according to Le Dauphine Libere.
An emergency unit has been set up at a local hospital to treat the many injuries. A decapitated body was found at the scene, with the head placed on the factory's fence.
The Public Prosecutor in Paris has opened a terrorism investigation.

Paris - France opened a terrorism investigation after an attack at a gas factory Friday left one person decapitated and multiple people wounded, officials said. One official said banners with Arabic writing were found near the body.
Two French officials said the attack began mid-morning when two men crashed a car into the entrance of a gas factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier in southeastern France, hitting gas canisters and touching off an explosion.
One of the attackers was arrested, they said. It was unclear what happened to the other attacker.
The decapitated body and banners with Arabic inscriptions were found near the factory entrance, one of the officials said.
Both officials spoke condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the news media.
In a statement, France's anti-terror prosecutor said an investigation was opened into the attack, which he said was carried out by "a terrorist group."
France went on high alert after an attack in January that left 20 people dead in the Paris region, including the Islamic extremist attackers.

Paris - French authorities found a man's decapitated head covered in Arabic writing attached to the gates of a gas factory that was attacked Friday, legal sources said.
The suspected attacker was arrested and was known to intelligence services, the sources said. Authorities are in the process of investigating whether he had an accomplice.
According to AFP, the suspect entered the factory and set off several small explosive devices.
Police said it was unclear whether the attacker was acting alone, or had accomplices.
"According to the initial findings of the enquiry, one or several individuals on board a vehicle, drove into the factory. An explosion then took place," said one of the sources.
"The decapitated body of a person was found nearby the factory but we do not yet know whether the body was transported to the place or not," added this source, adding that a "flag with Arabic writing on it was found at the scene."
A man thought to be the person who carried out the attack has been arrested, according to sources close to the enquiry, who said he was known to the security services.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he would go "immediately" to the scene, his office said.
Charlie Hebdo
Prime Minister Manuel Valls ordered increased security measures at all sensitive sites in the area.
Two Islamist brothers attacked the satirical magazine, killing 12. A policewoman and four hostages in a Jewish supermarket were also killed during the three-day attacks.
The January attacks drew record crowds onto the streets of Paris in a historic "march against terrorism".
Nearly four million people marched through the streets of France and more than 1.5 million in the French capital along with dozens of world leaders to express defiance in the wake of the attacks.
France has a high proportion of people that have gone to fight alongside Islamists in Iraq and Syria and has been on alert for possible attacks on its soil since the Charlie Hebdo attacks.
Earlier this week, the country passed a controversial new spying law granting sweeping powers to snoop on citizens.
The new French law allows authorities to spy on the digital and mobile communications of anyone linked to a "terrorist" inquiry without prior authorisation from a judge, and forces Internet service providers and phone companies to give up data upon request.
Intelligence services will have the right to place cameras and recording devices in private dwellings and install "keylogger" devices that record every key stroke on a targeted computer in real time.

Charlie Hebdo says prize protest a 'misunderstanding'
Saint-Quentin-Fallavier - An attacker carrying an Islamist flag killed one person and injured several others on Friday at a gas factory in eastern France, according to a legal source.
The suspected attacker entered the factory and set off several small explosive devices, the source said. A decapitated body was found nearby the factory, another source said.

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he would go "immediately" to the scene, his office said.
The attack occurred around 10:00, according to local media.
The attack came nearly six months after the Islamist attacks in and around Paris that killed 17 people in January that started with a shooting at satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Two Islamist brothers attacked the satirical magazine, killing 12. A policewoman and four hostages in a Jewish supermarket were also killed during the three-day attacks.
The attacks drew record crowds out on the streets of Paris days in a historic "march against terrorism".

North Korea claims it has cure for MERS, Ebola, Aids
Seoul - South Korea has introduced a new law designed to curb a MERS outbreak, tightening quarantine restrictions and imposing jail sentences on those who defy anti-infection measures in a crisis that has now left 31 dead.
Under the new law, passed in parliament late on Thursday, people infected with the virus who lie to state investigators about how they came into contact with the disease will face a fine or a prison sentence.
"False testimony would entail up two years in prison or $18 000 in fines," said the new law, which replaces the fine that could be meted out to anyone who did not tell the truth under previous legislation.
"Interviewees will [now] feel compelled to provide honest answers."
The new law also strengthens officials' power to restrict the movement of infected people and close contaminated facilities, with offenders who refuse to follow their orders also facing two years in prison or a $18 000 fine.
The number of state health workers in charge of preventing outbreaks and tracing them will also be doubled to more than 60.
Government failure
The legislation comes as South Korea's government is facing criticism for failing to stop the MERS outbreak, which has now become the largest ever outside Saudi Arabia.
Two new fatalities were reported on Friday, the health ministry said - both women, aged 79 and 80, who had existing health conditions.
A doctor at Seoul's Samsung Medical Centre, the hospital to which nearly half of all infections have been traced, was also confirmed to have contracted the disease.
The hospital earlier this week decided to extend indefinitely a 12-day suspension of normal services as patients, doctors and visitors continued to be diagnosed with the disease.
The latest fatalities brought the total death toll to 31, the health ministry said, with 181 people diagnosed with the deadly virus since the first case emerged on May 20.
Of those diagnosed, aside from the number of dead, 81 have recovered and 69 are still being treated, including 13 listed in critical condition.

Journalist kidnapped, killed in India
Bogota - A Colombian court has sentenced a state legislator to 36 years and three months in prison as the mastermind behind the killing of a well-known journalist.
Ferney Tapasco was convicted in the 2002 shooting death of Orlando Sierra, the deputy editor of La Patria newspaper in Manizales, about 165 kms northeast of Bogota. The sentence was announced on Wednesday.
The Committee to Protect Journalists on Thursday praised the sentencing, which came after years of delays and a series of questioned rulings in the case.
Sierra had been a harsh critic of politicians in the region.
One of the witnesses in the case testified that Tapasco paid for Sierra to be killed.

Moroccan men jailed for kissing in public: NGO
Jersey City - A nonprofit organisation that claimed it could turn gay men straight violated New Jersey's Consumer Fraud Act, a jury concluded on Thursday in a civil trial that an attorney for the plaintiffs called "a momentous event" for LGBT rights.
The jury said that Jews Offering New Alternatives for Healing, co-founder Arthur Goldberg and counsellor Alan Downing made misrepresentations and engaged in unconscionable business practices.
Three men and two parents were awarded about $72 000 in damages. The judge will rule later on their request to revoke the company's license, plaintiffs' attorneys said.
"This is a momentous event in the history of LGBT rights," attorney David Dinielli said. "The same lies that motivate gay conversion therapy motivate homophobia, that gay people are broken and need to be fixed. The strength of our plaintiffs brought that to light."
Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued during the trial that the group, known by the acronym JONAH, claimed a success rate that wasn't backed up by actual statistics and used therapy methods that had no scientific basis, including having one client beat a pillow, meant to represent his mother, with a tennis racket.
In an emailed statement, defense attorney Charles LiMandri called the verdict "a sad day, not just for my clients, but for America."
LiMandri said he would "seek justice on appeal".

ISIS video places UK hostage in Kobane
Ankara - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday dismissed as "propaganda" accusations that Islamic State fighters had been allowed to cross from Turkey into Syria to launch a fresh assault on the symbolic battleground town of Kobane.
"We condemn the heinous attack by the terrorist ISIS organisation that targeted innocent civilians in the city of Kobane," Erdogan said in a speech.
Dozens of civilians and fighters on both sides were killed when the ISIS jihadists made a surprise return to Kobane on Thursday, detonating a suicide car bomb near the border and battling Kurdish fighters in the city. Two more bombs exploded later in the day.
Claims circulating on the Internet suggested several cars loaded with IS militants passed through the Mursitpinar border crossing in Turkey to make their way into Kobane.
Describing those allegations as "defamation and propaganda", Erdogan said: "No one has the right to link Turkey to terrorist organisations".
Trending topic on Twitter
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 35 civilians and Kurdish fighters were killed in the car bomb and subsequent fighting in the centre and south of the town, along with 22 IS militants.
Turkish officials meanwhile said four victims had died in Turkish hospitals while 135 wounded received treatment on the Turkish side of the border.
The Turkish government said video footage taken from Turkish border security units and broadcast by the state-run Anatolia news agency showed a bomb-laden car did not pass through the Turkish border crossing.
But Kurdish activists accused Turkey on social media of assisting the ISIS group, with the hashtag #TerroristTurkey becoming a trending topic on Twitter.
Arin Shekhmos, a Syrian Kurdish activist, told AFP in Beirut earlier that ISIS had entered Syria from Turkey through the Mursitpinar border crossing.
He claimed the ISIS forces were wearing Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) uniforms as a disguise when they entered.
'Back and forth'
The accusations come amid growing tensions between Syrian Kurds and Turkey.
Turkey says Syrian Kurdish forces who recently made gains in Syria against IS are linked to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which for decades has waged a deadly insurgency inside Turkey.
Western states have repeatedly accused Turkey of not doing enough to halt the flow of jihadists in both directions across its 911km border with Syria.
Turkey fiercely rejects the accusations, saying it is making every effort to secure a long border and in turn has accused the West of not playing its part to shoulder the burden of hosting refugees from Syria.
But Turkey's opposition pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) accused the authorities of long allowing IS fighters back and forth across the border.
"IS has in every period being using the Turkish border. It's been going back and forth. There's lots of proof of this," HDP co-chair Figen Yuksekdag said.
"It's not logical to think that ISIS is no longer using the border when it has been doing so for so long before," she added.
Kurdish forces backed by US-led air strikes and peshmerga fighters from Iraq scored a major victory in January by winning a hugely symbolic battle for Kobane.
Months of fighting has prompted a mass exodus of local residents, with some 200 000 fleeing across the border into Turkey.
At least 35 000 Syrians returned home after Kobane's liberation, another Turkish official told AFP.
The official added that the border crossing of Mursitpinar that lies opposite Kobane has remained closed except for limited use by civilians returning after January.
He also said there was no sign of any new refugee influx so far.

Russia to boost nuclear arsenal - Putin
Washington - Russian President Vladimir Putin called his US counterpart Barack Obama on Thursday to discuss the conflict in Ukraine, the Islamic State group's advances and a deal on Iran's nuclear program.
The crisis in Ukraine has triggered the worst standoff between Russia and the West since the Cold War, and the US said earlier this week it would deploy heavy weapons in central and eastern Europe for the first time.
The US announcement followed promises by Nato on Monday to step up its military presence in eastern Europe, against the backdrop of the conflict in Ukraine.
Putin, who has consistently denied backing the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine, initiated the phone call with Obama, according to the White House.
"President Obama reiterated the need for Russia to fulfill its commitments under the Minsk agreements, including the removal of all Russian troops and equipment from Ukrainian territory," it said in a statement.
The crisis in Ukraine has killed 6 500 people in a little over a year and a peace deal struck in Minsk, Belarus has unravelled.
Obama and Putin also discussed Syria, where the self-proclaimed Islamic State group has made rapid gains, as well as historic negotiations between world powers and Iran over its disputed nuclear program.
"The leaders discussed the increasingly dangerous situation in Syria, and underscored the importance of continued P5+1 unity in ongoing negotiations to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon," the White House said.

Alabama lowers Confederate flag
Charleston - Emotions ran high as defiant mourners held the first funeral services on Thursday for nine African Americans shot dead by a white alleged supremacist in a Charleston church.
Hundreds filed past the open coffin of Ethel Lance, aged 70, at a funeral home in North Charleston, ahead of an afternoon service for Sharonda Singleton, aged 45.
The deceased were among the Bible study group that was targeted in the June 17 massacre at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.
Dylann Roof, aged 21, is charged with murder in connection with the multiple killings, which he reportedly hoped would trigger a race war between blacks and whites.
President Barack Obama is scheduled to deliver the eulogy at Friday's funeral of another victim, Emanuel's chief pastor Clementa Pinckney, aged 41.
Obama will also meet the families of some of the other victims.
There was raw emotion at the Royal Missionary Baptist Church as friends and relatives bid a final farewell to Lance, a custodian at a Charleston arts centre.
"I am here to tell you that we are stronger because we are together as a community," Reverend Norvell Goff told the mourners, the local Post and Courier newspaper reported.
Lance was later laid to rest at the Emanuel cemetery, where her children and grandchildren kissed her coffin and well-wishers threw roses into her grave.
Singleton, a speech pathologist, high-school track coach and pastor at Emanuel, was remembered by a capacity crowd at the 2 000-seat Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church.
"She believed she could change every child," said South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who attended both funeral services.
Seen in the pews were Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, two of the most recognizable civil rights activists in the United States today.
Obama "will be mindful of not just how sad it is that those individuals were taken from us, but also use the occasion to celebrate their lives," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.
"Many of them, in the way that they went about their day-to-day lives, I do think serve as a genuine inspiration to others about the way that they lived their lives and about the values that they sought to embody."
Thousands pay respects
Thousands have visited Pinckney's open coffin at the South Carolina legislature in the state capital Columbia, where he had served as a senator.
Services for the other victims are scheduled throughout the weekend and into next week.
Meanwhile, the campaign against the Confederate battle flag flying outside the South Carolina legislature picked up steam.
Adding his voice to the movement was College of Charleston president Glenn McConnell, a former Republican lieutenant governor and avid Civil War battle re-enactor.
As a state senator, McConnell favoured the positioning of the flag alongside a Confederate memorial on the State House grounds 15 years ago.
"Today is a different time," he said, adding that the flag should come down as a "statement of courtesy and goodwill to all those who may be offended by it."
Some revere the Civil War-era banner as an emblem of Southern heritage, but others condemn it as a symbol of racial hatred and white supremacy.
Roof's getaway car, he was arrested in North Carolina one day after the shooting bore a Confederate license plate, and photos later emerged online of him brandishing the flag together with a handgun.
Haley, a Republican with Tea Party support, has come out in favour of removing the flag, but the final decision hinges on a vote by the state legislature.
'Truly sorry'
Roof's relatives said they had been asked many questions about the massacre.
"As more information becomes available, we will do our best to answer them," read a statement widely circulated in US media.
"We would like to take this time to reflect on the victims and give their families time to grieve. We feel it would be inappropriate to say anything at this time other than that we are truly sorry for their loss."
In Washington, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said it was too early to say whether Roof is liable to face federal civil rights charges.
A hate crimes investigation is unfolding, she said, but "it's simply premature at this point to be able to announce" how the case will be handled.
Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder, one for each victim, and he is being held in solitary confinement.

EU approves military to tackle migrant smugglers
Brussels - EU leaders agreed early Friday to the principle of redistributing 40 000 asylum seekers across their bloc, but left the details to be hashed out later, amid hefty disagreement on whether member states should be obliged to take in the migrants.
Conflicts and repression in Africa and the Middle East have driven thousands of people to travel to the European Union in search of protection or a better life.
Many have lost their lives during attempts to cross the Mediterranean Sea, while the bulk of arrivals to the bloc have been concentrated in a handful of member states, stretching resources there. Less affected EU countries have been under pressure to show solidarity.
"Leaders agreed that 40 000 persons in need will be relocated from Greece and Italy to other states over the next two years," said EU President Donald Tusk, following late-night talks in Brussels.
A further 20 000 refugees will be resettled from outside the EU, such as displaced Syrians, the leaders agreed. EU interior ministers will finalize the scheme by the end of July, Tusk said.
But the summit discussion was bogged down by a fierce debate, after it became clear that several member states would oppose a mandatory scheme for the relocation of the 40,000 asylum seekers.
Frustration
"Passions are inflamed," one EU source said, as the talks dragged on into the early hours of Friday.
"If you do not agree with the 40 000, you do not deserve to be called Europe," Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told his counterparts, according to another source. "Either there is solidarity, or please don't waste our time," he added.
Sources said tensions were further exacerbated by a showdown between EU President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker over the decision-making process.
But the two top officials later played down their differences, locking arms as they walked to a joint press conference. Frustration was still evident, however.
Juncker said the leaders had reached a "modest" decision. "That we take hours to agree on the system to apply proves that Europe is not up to the ambitions that it declaims on every occasion," he added.
It is now expected that interior ministers will proceed with a voluntary redistribution scheme.
"Every country must offer its own contribution, and then afterwards we will see whether the sum of contributions allows us to reach the objective, and if it is not the case, corrections will have to be made," said French President Francois Hollande.
Tusk singled out circumstances in Hungary and Bulgaria, noting that they are also affected by "strong migratory flows," and said they would probably "be treated by us as specific cases when the time comes to distribute the pledges."
While attention has focused on the plight of migrants crossing the Mediterranean, the two eastern European countries have faced an influx of people crossing their land borders to reach the EU.
Hungary has the bloc's highest number of asylum requests, relative to population size, and Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been one of the strongest opponents of the proposed relocation scheme.
Earlier this week, Hungary controversially announced that it has stopped accepting asylum seekers being sent back to its territory after moving on to other EU countries.
EU rules stipulate that asylum claims must be processed in the member state where migrants first set foot.
Following the summit debate, German Chancellor Angela Merkel described migration as the "biggest challenge" that the EU had faced during her time in office.
"I see a huge task approaching us, and here it will be decided whether Europe is up to the task," she said.

US not spying on France's Hollande - Kerry
Paris - French President Francois Hollande on Friday condemned violent protests against ride-booking app Uber after taxi drivers set fire to vehicles and blocked highways but he said the service should be taken off the road.
Hollande described the demonstrations, in which US rocker Courtney Love was caught up, as "unacceptable violence in a democracy, in a country like France."
But Hollande, attending an EU leaders summit in Brussels, added: "UberPOP should be dissolved and declared illegal".
The service has been illegal in France since January, but the law has proved difficult to enforce and it continues to operate.
Around 3,000 cabbies took part in the strike Thursday, blocking access to the capital's Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, and preventing cars reaching train stations around the country.
Ten people were arrested, seven police officers were injured and 70 vehicles were damaged in clashes between Uber drivers and taxi drivers.
Taxi drivers are furious at what they see as unfair competition from Uber, which puts customers in touch with private drivers at prices lower than those of traditional taxis.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said after meeting taxi drivers' unions following a fraught day: "UberPOP is an illegal service, it must be closed down".
Until that was done, "the vehicles of UberPOP drivers should be systematically impounded when they are openly breaking the law", the minister said.
"Governing the country will never be done by the law of the jungle," Cazeneuve added.
One of the taxi drivers' representatives, Ibrahima Sylla, described the minister's words as "promises, again" and said the drivers were considering continuing the demonstrations.
Love, Kurt Cobain's widow, was caught up in a confrontation near Charles de Gaulle airport.
She tweeted that protesters "ambushed" her vehicle and "were holding our driver hostage".
She appealed to the French president in another message, writing "Francois Hollande where are the fucking police???"
"This is France?? I'm safer in Baghdad," she added.
Two vehicles torched
In the most serious incident in Paris, one private chauffeur, who said he did not work for Uber "or any other app" was dragged from his van when he reached a blockade in the west of Paris.
Angry taxi drivers slashed the tyres of his vehicle, smashed a window and then set it and a chauffeur-driven van on fire.
Police eventually fired teargas to break up the protest on the western stretch of the ring road around the capital and cleared burning tyres.
Licensed cabbies say Uber is endangering their jobs by flooding the market with low-cost drivers.
One driver said the strikers had been driven to desperation.
"Taxi drivers, alright, they've got big mouths but normally they're not aggressive," said Malia, aged 50, who has driven a taxi for three years.
"But these guys have families to feed, debts. They've been pushed to the brink."
More peaceful protests took place at transport hubs in other major cities including Bordeaux, Marseille and Toulouse.
Cabbies argued that the disruption was justified.
"UberPOP is banned, but it's still here," cabbie Stephane Molla said in Bordeaux, southwest France.
Taxi drivers in France, like their colleagues in several other countries, have held a number of protests against the app, some of which have turned violent.
On at least two occasions in Strasbourg in eastern France last week, taxi drivers posed as customers in order to lure Uber drivers to isolated spots where they were assaulted by cabbies and their vehicles damaged.
In Paris, the government tried to strengthen its hand on Wednesday by obtaining a court order banning Uber from operating in the capital, but the company dismissed the move.
"We will fight it [in the courts] and we'll see what happens on appeal. For the time being it changes nothing, UberPOP can continue to operate," the head of Uber France, Thibaud Simphal, told the BFM Business channel.
San Francisco-based Uber, which offers several types of ride-sharing services, claims to have 400,000 UberPOP users in France.
However, its drivers do not pay taxes, do not need to undergo the 250 hours of training mandatory for French cabbies and do not require the same insurance as taxis.
