ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greek authorities have launched a search and rescue operation in the eastern Aegean after a sailboat carrying dozens of migrants sank between the small islands of Agathonisi and Farmakonisi, near the Turkish coast.
The Greek coast guard said six people were rescued by a Greek helicopter, and another 10 by the Turkish coast guard while between 17 and 21 people were missing after the boat sank Tuesday.
Those rescued by the Turkish crews said there had been between 33 and 37 people on board. It was not clear why the boat sank, or what the migrants' nationalities were.
Tens of thousands of migrants have made their way from the Turkish coast to Greek islands so far this year, hoping to make their way to more prosperous European Union countries.

MADRID (AP)  Spanish police on Tuesday arrested a woman suspected of recruiting pre-teen girls and teenagers of both sexes to send to areas controlled by the Islamic State armed group in Syria.
An Interior Ministry statement said the woman, a Spaniard, was arrested in the city of Arrecife on the Canary Island of Lanzarote.
The ministry said the woman maintained contact with Islamic State militants in Syria, including a facilitator who gave her orders for recruiting girls and arranging their travel to Syria.
Girls and teens who she helped get to Syria ended up being sexually exploited, did domestic work and work in hospitals and had roles policing women, the statement said. A few joined the Islamic State as combatants, the statement said.
Authorities did not specify how many people the woman was suspected of recruiting but said police have been investigating her since 2014 in a probe overseen by the National Court in Madrid.
Spain has arrested dozens of suspected jihadi militants and recruiters in recent years.
On Monday, police arrested two men in Madrid for alleged collaboration with Kurdish groups fighting in Syria and Iraq.
The two are suspected of having being trained to use arms and explosives and fight guerrilla warfare. The ministry said their actions affected Spain's national interests.
The ministry said it hoped to dissuade other militants from enlisting and possibly falling into the hands of the Islamic State group, which could use them for propaganda.

WARSAW, Poland (AP)  Jewish officials are furious over a video installation at a Polish museum that shows naked men and women playing a game of tag in a gas chamber.
Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Jerusalem, called the exhibit at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow "so offensive and so disgusting that we found it necessary to protest."
"Game of Tag," made in 1999 by Polish artist Artur Zmijewski, has for years been accused of violating the dignity of Holocaust victims.
In response to protests, the museum put it behind an enclosure with a warning.
But Zuroff and other Jewish officials say it isn't enough. He said it is "simply incomprehensible" that the video is being shown in Poland, where Nazi Germany killed millions of Jews and non-Jews.

20 Most Confusing Performance Art Pieces Of All Time
of


Let's hit the ground running, shall we? In 1972, Vito Acconci stunned audiences at New York's Sonnabend Gallery when he buried himself, so to speak, under a ramp in the art haven and proceeded to masturbate, using the sound of visitors walking above him to spark his "sexual fantasies." He also used a microphone to project his ongoing monologue -- basically, a series of very dirty thoughts -- to the entire room.  The performance was, as you might expect, pretty controversial. Despite the obvious sexual undertones, however, the piece had broader intentions. "The troubled personality Acconci acted out resembles the paranoid, dissociated characters in American films of the era: Gene Hackman in 'The Conversation,' Robert de Niro in 'Taxi Driver,'" The Guardian's Jonathan Jones wrote in 2002.
In 2011, New York-based performance artist Marni Kotak gave birth to a healthy baby boy during a live durational exhibition titled "The Birth of Baby X." To do so, she built a home birthing center at Microscope Gallery (see above), invited an audience (and a doula) to oversee the labor and created a collection of birth memorabilia including a 10-foot trophy awarded to Baby X for being born.  The performance didn't stop there, though. "She plans to re-conceptualize her role as a parent to baby Ajax into a work of performance art that will last for the rest of her life," The Washington Post explained.
In 2010, NYU professor and Iraq-born artist Wafaa Bilal surgically implanted a camera into the back of his head for an intense, year-long surveillance project. Inspired by his past experience as a refugee, "3rdi" sought to take a photo every 60-seconds and publish his images on the web, in effect, capturing all the things he "leaves behind" on a daily basis.  "I see myself as a mirror reflecting some of the social conditions that we ignore," he said to CNN. "This will expose the unspoken conditions we face... A project like this is meant to establish a dialogue about surveillance."
French artist Abraham Poincheval's 2014 performance stunt was simple: He slept in a dead bear for two weeks. Yup, equipped with a small amount of food and water (plus a light, cushion, reading material, kettle and toilet of some kind), he hibernated inside the remains of a hollowed-out bear stomach at the Muse de la Chasse et de la Nature while fans watched him on a live feed.  We're sure the small quarters were claustrophobia-inducing, but from the photos and footage, it sort of appears as though the man was just relaxing in a cramped shelter, which, from the inside, looked nothing like the insides of a bear. Did he push his "physical limits" in the process? Maybe, but what's compelling the audience to care?
In 2007, a courageous masochistic DC-based artist named Adrian Parsons circumcised himself on stage, in front of an audience, with a dull Swiss army knife. Then he proceeded to stuff the removed foreskin into a glory hole.  "I was trying to penetrate -- in, yes, a direct, literal way -- the gallery and the audience. I wanted to be organic shrapnel," he explained to HuffPost. "Shrapnel" is, in fact, the name of the performance.
Once upon a time a politically-minded performance artist named Rachel Mason decided to reenact Paul Rand's infamous 13-hour filibuster. But, in typical contemporary performance art fashion, she did so dressed as her bizarre alter ego, FutureClown. Horror ensued.  "I happened to hear about Rand Paul's 13-hour filibuster on the news and as a performer, it just struck a chord," she explained to HuffPost. "I perform a lot and think about what it is to simply perform for any duration. It just seemed like an epic durational performance piece... In a strange way I would say aesthetically it almost feels like a Gertrude Stein novel."
Clayton David Pettet, a 19-year-old from Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design, found himself at the center of a media firestorm in 2013 when he announced his plan to have sex with an anonymous male partner... in front of a gallery audience. The project, called "Art School Stole My Virginity,' was inspired by his own experience as a 16-year-old student questioning the cultural significance of virginity. But what actually happened, was a little bit different than the show's tease.  The 120 audience members didn't end up watching Pettet engaged in his first "sexual" experience; instead, they were asked to "penetrate" the artist's mouth with a banana. "I think if people were expecting something else, it shows what they really wanted," the artist told Dazed Digital. "They didnt want an art piece, they wanted to see me have sex. If they came for the art, they wouldnt be as disappointed -- theyd know there were things to read between the lines for.
Ron Athey began his "Incorruptible Flesh" project back in 1996, but here's what his 2014 iteration looked like: The artist, naked and strapped to a metal examination table, transformed into a frightening corpse-like figure. The skin of his eyes pinned back, a baseball bat impaling him from behind, he invited viewers to "anoint" him with a white, foamy substance.  According to Grace Exhibition Space, Athey and his collaborators "studied the lives of saints, the relics and in particular, the display of the incorruptible bodies, most of which are wax sculptures with a corpse inside." He then adopted the incorruptible status as a representation of his HIV positive diagnosis, chock full of references to his childhood experiences with the Pentecostal church.
For some artists, creation is a labor of love. For others, it's literal labor, of the birthing variety. Swiss-born Milo Moire counts herself in the latter party, as evidenced by her 2014 performance piece, "Plop Egg Painting." In it, the female artist pushes paint eggs out of her vagina onto an empty canvas, taking Jackson Pollock's expressionist painting method to new and very nude heights.  "The 'PlopEgg Painting'...releases a loose chain of thoughts -- about the creation fear, the symbolic strength of the casual and the creative power of the femininity," a video description for the performance reads. "At the end of this almost meditative art birth performance the stained canvas is folded up, smoothed and unfolded to a symmetrically ref
In her 1964 performance "Meat Joy," Carolee Schneemann had eight underwear-clad men and women perform a partially choreographed routine, set to music, that involved writhing on the floor in a pile of paint, paper and lots of raw meat. Schneemann staged the strange happening in New York and London following the initial debut at the First Festival of Free Expression in Paris. It was described as an "erotic rite," simultaneously sensual and repellent.  "'Meat Joy' has such an intensive dynamic and carries all the themes of physicality, intensive improvisational contact and training with me," Schneeman recounted to HuffPost. "It carries itself through time and that's been very interesting to look at."
Feminist artist Casey Jenkins, a self-professed "craftivist," caught the attention of the pop performance art world in 2013 when she opted to knit from a ball of yarn wedged inside her vagina. "I'm spending 28 days knitting from wool that I've inserted in my vagina," the Melbourne-based artist stated in a video of the act. "Everyday I take a new skein of wool that's been wound so that it will unravel from the centre and I stick it up inside me... and then I pull out the thread and knit."  The work was called "Casting Off My Womb," and it incited a hilarious storm of Twitter outcry.
In 2013 Tilda Swinton napped at New York's Museum of Modern Art, showing up several times unannounced to sleep in a glass box somewhere in the famous art institute. Called "The Maybe," the work was a reprisal of an earlier Swinton napfest (circa 1995), and was, well, kind of boring.  MoMA's description of the work: An integral part of The Maybe's incarnation at MoMA in 2013 is that there is no published schedule for its appearance, no artist's statement released, no museum statement beyond this brief context, no public profile or image issued. Those who find it chance upon it for themselves, live and in real -- shared -- time: now we see it, now we don't.
From animal slaughters as religious sacrifices to faux crucifixions, Hermann Nitsch has long been known as a "cult provocateur" and the "Pope of Viennese Aktionism." Whether he was drinking blood or drunkenly processing, his pagan rituals often involved the audience as participants, rather than mere viewers.
In an homage to Gustav Courbet's "The Origin of the World" (that saucy, unabashed portrait of a woman's genitalia), Luxembourgian artist Deborah de Robertis transformed the two-dimensional masterpiece into a live performance art piece by sitting in front of the 1866 artwork and baring her own "origin of the world" for all patrons of Paris' Muse dOrsay to see.  The artist was arrested for her bold move (she did not plan ahead with the museum to see if, you know, they'd be cool with her showing her vulva to unsuspecting kids and adults), but she managed to make her intentions known.  If you ignore the context, you could construe this performance as an act of exhibitionism, but what I did was not an impulsive act, she explained to Luxemburger Wort. There is a gap in art history, the absent point of view of the object of the gaze... I am not showing my vagina, but I am revealing what we do not see in the painting, the eye of the vagina, the black hole, this concealed eye, this chasm, which, beyond the flesh, refers to infinity, to the origin of the origin.
In 2000, Chinese performance artist Zhu Yu recorded himself eating what appeared to be a dead fetus stolen from a medical school. It was presented at the bombastic "Fuck Off" exhibition organized by Ai Weiwei and Feng Boyi. When stills of the act (which did not actually involve a human fetus) hit a Channel 4 documentary in the UK, critics tore the artist apart for courting recognition with deliberately shocking art.  "No religion forbids cannibalism," Zhu Yu claims in the video above. "Nor can I find any law which prevents us from eating people. I took advantage of the space between morality and the law and based my work on it."
Aliza Shvarts, a 2008 art major at Yale, documented her nine-month process artificially inseminated herself on a regular basis while simultaneously taking abortifacient drugs to induce miscarriages. The resulting exhibition featured video recordings of the miscarriages and physical evidence of the experience, including blood.  "For the past year, I performed repeated self-induced miscarriages," Shvarts wrote in a column for Yale Daily News. "Using a needleless syringe, I would inject the sperm near my cervix within 30 minutes of its collection, so as to insure the possibility of fertilization. On the 28th day of my cycle, I would ingest an abortifacient, after which I would experience cramps and heavy bleeding... Because the miscarriages coincide with the expected date of menstruation (the 28th day of my cycle), it remains ambiguous whether the there (sic) was ever a fertilized ovum or not."  "The reality of the pregnancy, both for myself and for the audience, is a matter of reading," she added.  Yale University, rather predictably, took issue with the artist's project, calling it a "creative fiction." When Shvarts spoke out against that claim, reaffirming that the piece was in fact "university sanction," Yale said that statement was "part of the performance."
For a 2003 piece titled "I Miss You," Italian artist Franco B walked down a catwalk at London's Tate Modern museum covered in white body paint and bleeding from self-inflicted wounds on his wrists. "I dont make work that lives in somebodys living room," the artist said to Metro UK, "but lives in the memory because it speaks to them. Art is about creating language and memories. Language is like a virus that can invade you, and I love that."
Before there was Pussy Riot there was Voina (meaning "war" in Russian), a collective of radical street artists and performers who challenge Russia's authoritative regime through a series of public disruptions, based largely in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The acts can range from painting giant penises on bridges to violently overturning police cars to tossing cats at McDonalds employees, but their most infamous performance was a public orgy.  The orgy took place at the Timiryazev State Biological Museum in Moscow in February of 2008 as an action titled "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!" Aiming their outrage at presidential hopeful Dmitry Medvedev (whose last name comes from the word medved, or "bear"), the Voina members stripped naked and engaged in sexual intercourse on the floor of the museum as a means of "subversively affirming" the state's fertility and reproduction goals.
Who could forget Marina Abramovic's 2010 endurance spectacle "The Artist is Present," in which the Serbian artist spent 736 hours staring at Museum of Modern Art visitors across a table. It was a giant exhibition that prompted headlines like "Wait, Why Did That Woman Sit in the MoMA for 750 Hours?" and blogs like this.  "Its narcissistic, exhibitionistic work, and it has brought out the crowds own narcissism and exhibitionism, in a self-fulfilling feedback loop," New York Magazine's Jerry Saltz wrote. "But its also very compelling."
We began with Vito Acconci so why not end with Chris Burden, the artist who allowed a friend to shoot him with a .22 rifle from 15 feet away... all in the confines of a gallery in 1971.

        <title>Artist Grimanesa Amoros Combines Architecture And Ecology For Spellbinding Public Work</title>

Why craft boring suspension bridges or arched overpasses when humanity is capable of building massive architectural feats like this to cross a river? The impressive, undulating design, destined to function as a pedestrian footbridge over the Dragon King Harbour River in China, is the product of NEXT Architects. The bridge design involves three individual, swirling lanes hovering over the picturesque landscape of Changsha.  The rendering won an international competition associated with a new public park in the area last year, and the project is currently under construction. The construction with the intersecting connections is based on the principal of the Mbius ring, states Michel Schreinemachers on the NEXT website. On the other hand it refers to a Chinese knot that comes from an ancient decorative Chinese folk art, John van de Water adds.
This image of an 80-story skyscraper, imagined by Dynamic Architecture's David Fisher back in 2008, is a far-fetched rendering fit for Dubai's future rich and famous. Why? Because it rotates.  The enormous, towering building would have floors that move ever so slightly, completing a 360 degree rotation every 90 minutes. Forget about fighting for an east-facing apartment, the suites in Dynamic Architecture's creation would have all four cardinal directions covered. And it get's better. The building would be equipped with several giant wind turbines that generate electricity for tenants, and penthouse residents would be able to park their car at their apartments thanks to nifty lifts.  While we're not sure this design will ever actually come to fruition (it was scheduled to be up and running in 2010), it's certainly a visual feast worth ogling.
In November of 2013, the Strelka Institute announced the winner of a two-stage international competition to design Zaryadye Park, Moscow's first new public park in over 50 years. The winner was Diller Scofidio + Renfro (in collaboration with Hargreaves Associates and Citymakers), who proposed this particularly stunning design based on a theory of "Wild Urbanism," or the concept of a "hybrid landscape where the natural and the built cohabit to create a new public space."  The park will feature four landscape typologies -- tundra, steppe, forest and wetland, integrating augmented micro-climates that will enable the park to function as a public space throughout Russias extreme winters. Essentially, the quasi-indoor environments will involve regulated temperatures, controlled wind and simulated daylight that encourage 24/7, year-round park pleasure. As Diller Scofidio +Renfro aptly put it, "Zaryadye Park will embody the past and the future simultaneously."
nvisible architecture is the calling card of science fiction design, and we're happy to report that architects of today are on the case. Of course, there's South Korea's in-the-works, LED-clad Infinity Tower. CNN reported in 2013 that "the invisibility illusion will be achieved with a high-tech LED facade system that uses a series of cameras that will send real-time images onto the building's reflective surface."   But there's also the shorter, less flashy structure (pictured above) designed by New York-based architecture firm stpmj. The parallelogram-shaped barn would be made of wood and sheeted with mirror film, at a cost of $5,000. The idea is to "blur the perceptual boundary" between object and setting, according to a statement sent by the architects to The Huffington Post earlier this year. We have to say we're impressed with architects' ability to push the boundaries of what invisible really means.
For his series "Dauphin Island," artist Dionisio Gonzalez designed dreamlike, futuristic forts made from iron and concrete, fusing the role of artist with that of architect, engineer and urban planner. The peculiar edifices -- the hybrid of a beach house, a bunker and a space ship -- were designed with the residents of Dauphin Island in mind. Located off the coast of Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico, the tiny landmass is known for experiencing perpetual and catastrophic hurricanes. When a storm hits the small island of around 1,200 people, it often washes away much of the coastline, leaving residents to rebuild their homes again and again.  Gonzalez created hypothetical blueprints for his forts, illustrating how his bulbous, concrete structures would better suit the fraught island's populous. You can learn more about the project on his website. Keep in mind, these structures are not yet slated for reality, but they certainly paint an interesting picture of what futuristic island homes could look like.
Dubai's Burj Khalifa is widely known as the world's tallest building, measuring in at a whopping 2,716.5 feet and 160 stories. The structure itself is mesmerizing, but what's even more intriguing is a think tank's bizarre proposal to cover the towering skyscraper in a giant fabric casing made of reflective material.  We learned about the project, dubbed EXO-BURJ, in 2014. The strange, sock-like covering would wrap around the entire building, from spire to ground level, in a "super-lightweight, reflective and semi-transparent fabric material," according to a description by the Dubai-based think tank, OP-EN. The temporary "sweater" would reflect the expansive urban scenes around it, turning the Burj Khalifa into a massive mirror in the vein of Christo and Jeanne-Claude.
What is there to do with an outdated, eyesore of a power plant in the future? Why not give the sprawling facilities a green makeover, one that would serve two functions: to beautify the structure and provide a new way of dealing with CO2 emissions.  Here's how it would work: The architecture firm AZPA (Alejandro Zaera-Polo Arquitectura) plans to turn the existing Wedel Vattenfall power plant in Germany into a new industrial complex, one that would be built up from the previous facilities and wrapped with a corrugated skin of creeper plants. This strategically-placed skin would not only soften the exterior aesthetic of the plant, but it would create a sheath of creepers to absorb CO2 emissions. AZPA describes the endeavor, imagined in 2013, as "an attempt to resolve the conflict between the natural ecology and the manmade environment."
Earlier this year, the Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 selected The Livings circular tower of organic and reflective bricks -- called "Hy-Fi" -- as the winner of the Young Architects Programs (YAP) 15th edition. The temporary structure will be built using a new method of bio-design incorporating entirely organic material.  As Arch Daily reported back in February, the tower will involve "the unique stacking of two new materials: Ecovative-manufactured organic bricks, made from corn stalks and specially-developed living root structures; and reflective bricks, designed by 3M, that were used as growing trays for the organic bricks before being implemented into the structure."  Bonus: According to MoMA's site, Hy-Fi will is the first sizable structure to claim near-zero carbon emissions in its construction process and represents a 100% compostable design. Recurring to the latest developments in biotech, it reinvents the most basic component of architecture -- the brick -- as both a material of the future and a classic trigger for open-ended design possibilities."
Forget interior decorators, the future of indoor design will be run by 3D printers. We have architects Michael Hansmeyer and Benjamin Dillenburger to thank for introducing us to this concept. The two pulled off a three-dimensional printing feat to rival them all just last year. As part of the project "Digital Grotesque," the duo 3D printed an entire room, creating a 16-square-meter cube adorned with unbelievable ornamentation that looks like it belongs in a futuristic cathedral.  "We aim to create an architecture that defies classification and reductionism," states the group's website. "Digital Grotesque is between chaos and order, both natural and the artificial, neither foreign nor familiar. Any references to nature or existing styles are not integrated into the design process, but are evoked only as associations in the eye of the beholder."
It's hard not to love this New York design project from Family and PlayLab, which plans to bring a giant filtration system to the murky waters between Manhattan and Brooklyn. The project would take the shape of a 164-foot long floating pool set to take shape in 2016 -- if all funding efforts go as planned. If there are swimming pools in our future, let them look like this.  In a statement released at the end of 2013, pool masterminds Archie Lee Coates IV, Dong-Ping Wong and Jeff Franklin announced they are beginning construction on Float Lab, an experimental version of the planned 164-foot +POOL. They raised the funds for the smaller pool (35 feet by 35 feet, to be exact) through their last Kickstarter endeavor. With a launch date planned for this summer, the mini pool will put the team's filtration membranes to the test in real-river conditions.  "We dont think about using the river recreationally at all," Coates explained in a previous interview with Huff Post. "So as an architect you think, 'What if we could change that or propose an idea that could change that?' We decided to pitch [+Pool] to the world. We just had no idea the response we would get."
From the outside it resembles a giant, plushy purple jelly bean, and on the inside it looks more like a glowing, colored seashell. But this balloon-like form is actually the world's first inflatable concert hall, entitled "Ark Nova." Iconic British sculptor Anish Kapoor and Japanese architect Arata Isozaki teamed up to create the structure, meant to tour through areas of Japan affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. It's a novel idea that could make for an innovative design strategy in many other fields.  "I am honored to have been asked to design Ark Nova for the Tohoku area," Kapoor states on the Ark Nova site. "The structure defines a space for community and for music in which color and form enclose. I hope that the devastation can be overcome by creativity. Music can give solace and bring community together and in so doing can help us to see we are not alone."
While wooden skyscrapers might not be as sensational as the previously mentioned rotating tower, the idea of building 34 wooden stories on on top of the other is pretty astonishing.  And it might become a reality if Scandinavian practice C.F. Mller and DinnellJohansson -- 2013's winners of the HSB Stockholm architectural competition -- follow through with their rendering for the world's tallest wooden skyscraper. The design (pictured above) is one of three ultra-modern residential high-rises planned for Stockholms city center in 2023, but the catch is, only one of these proposals will actually be built.
It's no secret that New York's Gowanus Canal is a breeding ground for toxic waste, polluted runoff, and raw sewage that's -- rather unfortunately -- been dumped directly into the area's bodies of water. But a little project known as "Sponge Park" is hoping to transform the Brooklyn locale into a cleaner, properly filtered sanctuary -- and provide a model for future urban design.  The Gowanus Canal Conservancy and the landscape architecture firm dlandstudio announced in the summer of 2013 that they plan to employ a system of landscape buffers and remediation wetlands to slow, absorb, and filter Gowanus' polluted sewer runoff before it reaches the canal. So, not only will the Sponge Park turn 11.4 acres of contaminated fields into a pleasant waterfront arena, it will provide a means of absorbing harmful pollutants that continue to ooze into the industrial battlefield.  "In a process called phytoremediation, specially selected plants metabolize pollutants and heavy metals present in the contaminated water," the American Society of Landscape Architects explains on its website. "Dirty water from the combined sewer system is captured in underground storage tanks and slowly released into the landscape."
In 2014, Chinese architecture firm MAD unveiled renderings of Chaoyang Park Plaza, a center of skyscrapers, office blocks and public spaces meant to mimic the appearance of mountains, hills and lakes depicted in Chinese landscape paintings. The complex is now under construction in Beijing, and will result in an expansive sky line seemingly ripped from the pages of a futuristic novel.  "By transforming features of Chinese classical landscape painting, such as lakes, springs, forests, creeks, valleys, and stones, into modern 'city landscapes,' the urban space creates a balance between high urban density and natural landscape," MAD writes on its website. "The forms of the buildings echo what is found in natural landscapes, and re-introduces nature to the urban realm."  Lucky for Beijing, the innovative skyline is already under construction.

Hillary Clinton
Being a world leader, we can only assume, takes up a lot of time. So we totally understand that political figures past and present, from Abe Lincoln to Che Guevara to Hillary Clinton, haven't quite had room in their schedules to keep up with the latest trends and adjust their signature looks accordingly.
But what if, in some alternate universe, your favorite politicians took a hiatus from their legislative duties to update their haircuts, wardrobes and tattoo games? Artist Amit Shimoni imagines such a world in his illustrated series " Hipstory ." And though they may not be accomplishing quite as much in the way of political activism or diplomacy, we have to admit they look damn good.
Barack Obama
Barack Obama sports a dreadlocked topknot while Hillary Clinton opts for a candy-colored ombr cut. George Washington flaunts an eagle chest tattoo peeking out from atop his low-cut tee, and Ronald Reagan sports a flashy diamond stud.
" The history of the last century is heavily defined by its prominent figures ," Shimoni explained in an earlier email to HuffPost, "the main leaders who shaped the course of history. I often find myself imagining a world where some of these leaders are less interested in influencing lives, and more focused on their own persona."
George Washington
Shimoni's vibrant portraits access a realm where past iconic figures become obsessed with contemporary anxieties, like looking super cool. Placed against striking, saturated backdrops, the square illustrations resemble Instagram uploads that never were. Shimoni's project doesn't intend to criticize the current youth generation and its interest in cultivating a desirable persona, but rather to shed light on the different ways we've visualized ourselves throughout history.
"It is my hope that this series will encourage us to reflect: upon our leaders, our society, and ourselves," the artist adds. "And failing that, HIPSTORY will at least make us smile." See Shimoni's delightfully preposterous images below and let us know if you wish Hillary would opt for a similar look IRL.

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP)  A bomb blast in Nigeria's northern university town of Zaria killed 25 people Tuesday including a 2-year-old toddler, the Kaduna state governor reported, the latest in a string of deadly bombing and shooting attacks by the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group.
Gov. Nasir el-Rufai urged citizens to avoid crowded public places including mosques and churches as the militants widen and accelerate the pace of attacks that have killed some 300 people in a week. Boko Haram may be responding to an Islamic State group order to commit more mayhem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The blast targeted government headquarters in the historic Muslim town as civil servants assembled to welcome a new chairman, El-Rufai said in an email to The Associated Press.
"Terrorists detonated explosives that killed and injured several persons ... (with) 25 fatalities including a 2-year-old," el-Rufai said.
Thirty-two wounded victims are being treated at the university teaching hospital, he said.
Boko Haram wants to install an Islamic state across the West African nation of about 170 million people divided between a predominantly Muslim north and Christian south. The extremists say democracy has brought nothing but woes to Nigerians plagued by endemic corruption that keeps Africa's biggest oil producer and richest economy mired in poverty.
Nigeria's police force Monday night announced increased security around mosques and churches after Boko Haram assaults on Sunday killed more than 60 people in a mosque and posh Muslim restaurant in central Jos city and at an evangelical Christian church in northeastern Potiskum town.
The attacks come just five weeks into the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim and former military dictator who has vowed to crush the 6-year-old insurgency that has killed more than 13,000 people and driven 1.5 million from their homes.

My first memory is of the day my brother was born: November 14, 1991. I can remember my father driving my grandparents and me over to the hospital in Highland Park, Illinois, that night to see my newborn brother.

It was the final two minutes of a Thomas the Tank Engine episode. I can even remember the precise story: Percy Takes the Plunge, which feels appropriate, given that I too was about to recklessly throw myself into the adventure of being a big brother.
In sentimental moments, Im tempted to say my brothers birth is my first memory because it was the first thing in my life worth remembering. There could be a sliver of truth to that: Research into the formation and retention of our earliest memories suggests that peoples memories often begin with significant personal events, and the birth of a sibling is a textbook example. But it was also good timing. Most peoples first memories date to when they were about 3.5 years old, and that was my age, almost to the day, when my brother was born.

        <MainBody>Here's What The Future Of Energy Might Look Like. And It's Pretty Amazing (VIDEO)
Posted:

You're already familiar with solar power, wind power, and even water power. But when it comes to the future of energy, those renewable power sources soon could be old news. Scientists and engineers are now building mashup versions of the renewable sources we're using today with the goal of generating power with even greater efficiency and sustainability.
"The next category is sort of putting together elements that already exist but havent been put together," John Rogers, senior energy analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists , told The Huffington Post in a telephone interview. "What comes to mind is solar and wind... or putting solar panels in places they haven't been put before."
That's not all. Work is continuing on fusion energy, and scientists are also exploring ways to harness energy from space. Check out the video above, and/or read the transcript below for four promising sources of energy that may power our future. Don't forget to leave your thoughts in the comments below. C'mon, talk nerdy to me!
CLICK HERE FOR FULL TRANSCRIPT
Fossil fuels like coal or oil are great at providing power, but they also give us pollution , climate change , and even wars . Thats why scientists are seeking alternative and renewable sources of energy to power our future homes and cars. What will the future bring when it comes to energy? Heres what scientists have determined either to be working or to have significant promise.
Hey everyone. Jacqueline Howard here. Renewable sources of energy have been in use for quite some time now. We have water, wind, and solar. But these sources account for only 13 percent of Americas electricity generation . Looking ahead, scientists not only hope to combine these sources into hybrid versions of themselves, but there are also some untapped renewable sources of energy that show promise. Here are just a few examples of what you could see in the future that may seem totally sci-fi but are actually very real.
1. We may beam down energy from space.
Now this sounds like something from an episode of The Jetsons. But Japan is mulling over plans to build a space-based solar power farm --essentially a giant satellite that would include several so-called solar collectors (kind of like solar panels) to capture solar energy that otherwise would bypass the Earth. The energy would be transmitted to us here on Earth in the form of either laser beams or microwaves. Of course, this concept is still in the early stages of development.
2. We may have solar panels in bizarre places.
Here on Earth, weve captured the suns power using solar panels on rooftops, carports, and even in windows. But now, we may see these solar panels all over the place. In Korea, for instance, engineers have lined up solar panels that cover a bike path , providing a tunnel to travel through. On the other hand, in the Netherlands, engineers have put energy-generating solar panels in the surface of a bike path . And in California, solar panels are placed over water reservoirs , not only to generate energy but also to block sunlight that may cause the water to evaporate. Thats important, given the states ongoing drought.
3. We may see a wind-solar hybrid on steroids.
Plans are afoot to build a massive 2,235-foot-tall tower in the Arizona desert that would produce clean energy. It would be the worlds second-tallest structure . Heres how it would work. A series of pumps would send water to the top of the tower . The water would be injected out into a tunnel opening thats part of the tower, creating a mist. There, the mist would mix with dry, desert air that had been heated by the sun. That dry air would absorb the water particles and become heavy, causing it to fall through the tunnel, creating wind that spins turbines at the base, which then power generators to produce electricity.
4. We may be fussing over fusion.
Yes, fusion energy. It may not be renewable energy, but it still may be a power source for our future. Its produced when hydrogen reaches a temperature in excess of 100 million degrees Celsius. At that point, the hydrogen is contained in a high-powered magnetic confinement system , where positively charged hydrogen atoms, stripped of their electrons, fuse to form helium. This fusion produces energy.
An international research team is setting out to design and possibly operate the worlds first electricity-producing fusion power plant . It could produce energy around year 2027 at the earliest, but scientists are trying to think of a faster way to develop fusion energy as a viable source.
After all, fusion is what powers our sun. At extreme temperatures in our star, atoms react the same way to produce energy. That means, for all of human existence, most of our energy has come from nuclear fusion.
And think about the sources of energy we started using during the Industrial Revolution, some 225 years ago -- Im talking about the oil, natural gas, and coal that powered buildings, machine tools, and transportation. Those fossil fuels are made of dead plant and animal matter thats been compressed in the Earth for millions of years. Animals feed off of plants. Plants produce the material they need to grow through photosynthesis. The sun causes photosynthesis. See the connection here?
Nearly all sources of energy are linked back to the sun. But do you think the sun will remain our biggest source of energy? Or will we move on to space solar or even man-made fusion? What will the future hold? Let me know your thoughts.

Commissioned by Avrosti Holding, the Zira Island Masterplan is a zero-energy resort situated within the Caspian Sea near Azerbaijan's Seven Peaks. Designed to be a model for sustainable development, the resort utilizes wind, water and solar energy systems -- including naturally powered desalination and water treatment plants.    Source:  BIG
P.S.62 Richmond will be the first net-zero energy school in New York City and in the Northeast United States. When completed, the cutting-edge building will harvest as much energy from renewable on-site sources as it uses on an annual basis.   Using a photovoltaic array, SOM's design will offer an energy-use reduction of 50% over a SCA standard public school.  Sustainable and low-energy features incorporated in the design include an ultra-tight high-performance building envelope, daylit offset corridors, energy efficient lighting fixtures, low-energy kitchen equipment, a greenhouse and vegetable garden, a geo-exchange system, energy recovery ventilators and demand-control ventilation, and a solar thermal system for hot water  Source: NYCSCA  SOM
Conceived by architectural upstart BIG for Stockholm's Swedish Transport Administration, the Grontmij Spacescape's hyper-futuristic structures transform Stockholm's E18 and E4 highways in to a "pie chart park." The 30 percent of the sphere that faces the sun is covered in photovoltaic film, which produces enough energy to keep the sphere afloat -- in addition to supplying 235 houses with electricity.

Another design from BIG, the Shenzhen Energy Mansion is a massive skyscraper that leverages natural climate conditions to regulate internal temperatures. The facade's folds shade the building from the sun, avoiding the overheating problems caused by traditional facades.  The result is an energy-lean structure with minimal reliance on air-conditioning.  Source:  BIG
This residential building from ARO meets the rigorous German Passive House standard, which uses approximately 75% less energy than conventional American construction. Through airtight construction, mechanically circulation ventilation, and solar optimization, a Passive House maintains a consistent internal temperature, requiring only minimal heating and cooling.    Windows and skylights open the interior to views and are optimized to receive southern light. The roof and walls are sheathed with corrugated aluminum. The silver color, muted reflectivity and fine texture of this cladding contribute to a sense of vibrancy that counters the gray winter months.    Source:   ARO
The 2.3-million square-foot Pearl River Tower redefines what is possible in sustainable design by incorporating the latest green technology and engineering advancements.

Developed by Form-ula in an effort to create a Zero-Environmental Footprint for the 300 North LA -- the Predator BLDG aims to minimize the distance between the occupant and the outside world.   The building addresses the lack of day-lighting and natural-ventilation to eliminate the large mechanical dependencies usually employed to keep the space properly lit and cooled, a trend that can be found in many buildings from that era.  The building also features a system for harvesting water for occupant use and building functions -- inducing the condensation of moisture and by filtering grey/black water via Living Machine.

The Atwater Project pays careful attention to site strategy, water runoff and material selection. The residence halls are naturally ventilated, incorporating through-floor suite plans, transom windows and ceiling fans in all rooms. Ventilation is supplemented by attic fans, which exhaust through rooftop "chimneys." The dining hall incorporates a planted roof, providing excellent insulation, protection of the roofing membrane, and, most significantly, reduction of impervious surfaces on campus. The green roof allows the college landscape to extend literally through and across the dining hall structure.  Source:   Kieran +Timberlake

VIENNA, July 7 (Reuters) - Iran and major powers will  continue negotiations on an historic nuclear deal past Tuesday's  deadline for a long-term agreement, European Union foreign  policy chief Federica Mogherini said.
"We are continuing to negotiate for the next couple of days.  This does not mean we are extending our deadline," Mogherini  told reporters.
The deal under discussion between Iran, Britain, China,  France, Germany, Russia and the United States is aimed at  curbing Tehran's most sensitive nuclear work for a decade or  more, in exchange for relief from sanctions that have slashed  Iran's oil exports and crippled its economy.
"We might see some ministers leaving in the next hours and  then ready to come back," Mogherini said.
"We are interpreting in a flexible way our deadline, which  means that we are taking the time, the days we still need, to  finalize the agreement," she said, adding that there remained  several difficult issues to resolve.
The negotiators missed a June 30 deadline for a final  agreement and then gave themselves until Tuesday.     (Reporting by John Irish, Louis Charbonneau, Arshad Mohammed  and Parisa Hafezi)

Zea Bowling, the Ohio girl who became an Internet sensation last week when she calmly and quietly waved a rainbow flag as a homophobic preacher screamed at her , is using her newfound fame to make a difference.
An image of Zea (pronounced "Zay-uh") was turned into a T-shirt by a local artist , and in a video released on Monday, the 7-year-old said she would donate half the funds from sales of the shirt to the Kaleidoscope Youth Center , an LGBTQ youth community center in Columbus.
"I want to donate money from my T-shirts to help kids have fun and be safe ," Zea said in a video released on Monday.
Following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states , Zea attended a local arts and music festival with her family. As happened across the country, the event became an impromptu celebration of the decision, and Zea was waving a rainbow flag when the preacher approached and began yelling at her through a microphone.
Instead of backing down, Zea waved her flag in an image that quickly went viral across social media:

Ryan Bowling, Zea's dad, told The Huffington Post via email that she isn't really conscious of her sudden fame.
"Thankfully, Zea is not on social media, and she doesn't watch the news, so that has helped to shield her from much of the buzz," Bowling said. "That having been said, at play-dates, the first thing her friends have said to her has been 'Zea, I saw you on TV last night!'"
As for Zea's distinctive name, Bowling said they were looking for something unique and pretty.
"We didn't want her to ever be mistaken for anybody but herself," he said.
There's little chance of that happening now.

BRUSSELS, July 7 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis  Tsipras had a final chance to present credible reform proposals  to an emergency euro zone summit on Tuesday to persuade  skeptical creditors to reopen aid talks before his country's  banks run out of money.
With Greek lenders down to their last few days of cash and  the European Central Bank tightening the noose on their funding,  Tsipras must convince the bloc's other 18 leaders, many of whom  are exasperated with five years of crisis, to authorize  negotiations fast on a new loan to rescue Greece.
But Greek officials said the leftist premier's proposals  would not go far beyond a plan he sent to the euro zone last  week before Greek voters overwhelmingly rejected the austerity  terms of a bailout in a referendum on Sunday.
The leaders of Germany and France, the currency area's two  main powers, said after conferring on Monday that the door was  still open to a deal to save Greece from plunging into economic  turmoil and ditching the euro.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, under pressure in Germany to cut  Greece loose, made clear it was up to Tsipras to come up with  convincing proposals after Athens spurned the tax rises,  spending cuts and pension and labor reforms that were on the  table before its 240 billion euro bailout expired last week.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, under  suspicion from both sides for trying to broker a last-minute  deal, told the European Parliament: "There are some in the  European Union who openly or secretly are working to exclude  Greece from the euro zone."
He did not name names but may have been referring to German  Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who has made no secret of  his skepticism about Greece's fitness to stay in the euro and  last week suggested a possible "temporary" exit.
From the Greek side, the key to making any deal politically  acceptable will be to win a stronger commitment from Merkel and  other lenders to reschedule Greece's giant debt burden, which  the International Monetary Fund says is unsustainable.
Without some firmer pledge of debt relief, neither Greece  nor the IMF is likely to accept a deal. But that may be more  than Germany and its northern allies can swallow.
Schaeuble said on arrivial for a preparatory meeting of  finance ministers that anyone who had read the EU treaty knew  debt write-offs were forbidden in the euro zone. He did not rule  out other forms of restructuring.
Asked about reports that Greece was seeking an immediate  bridging loan of several billion euros, Italian Finance Minister  Pier Carlo Padoan the creditors would listen to Greek requests.
"The door is open to negotiations, but there isn't much time  left and the situation is urgent both for Greece and for  Europe," French President Francois Hollande said in a joint  media appearance with Merkel in Paris on Monday.
At stake at the emergency summit beginning at 6 p.m. (1600  GMT) in Brussels is more than just the future of Greece, a  nation of 11 million that makes up just 2 percent of the euro  zone's economic output and population.
If Greek banks run out of money and the country has to print  its own currency, it could mean a state leaving the euro for the  first time since it was launched in 1999, creating a precedent  and fueling doubts about the long-term viability of an  incomplete European monetary union.
"Even if it did not trigger a short-term domino effect, the  integrity of the euro zone would come under fresh threat with  each episode of political uncertainty within member countries,"  said Thibault Mercier, an analyst at BNP Paribas.
Even in France, the euro zone country most sympathetic to  Athens, an opinion poll published on Tuesday showed one in two  people want Greece to leave the euro zone.

CONCESSIONS UNCLEAR
Strengthened by the overwhelming 61.3 percent 'No' vote in  Sunday's referendum, the leftist Tsipras won the unprecedented  support of all other Greek party leaders on Monday and replaced  his abrasive Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis with the  soft-spoken negotiator Euclid Tsakalotos.
Tsakalotos entered the euro zone finance ministers' meeting  without comment. Eurogroup chairman Jeroen Dijsselbloem said it  was up to Greece to show a credible way forward.
"The pressure is especially on the Greeks, the banks are  closed and the situation is difficult. I guess the Greek  government has an interest in coming up with serious and  credible solutions soon," Dijsselbloem told reporters.
In an intensive round of telephone diplomacy, Tsipras spoke  to the heads of the ECB, the IMF and the European Commission, as  well as Merkel, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S.  Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
The United States, China and Japan all called for a solution  in which Greece stays in the euro zone.
Tsipras gave little clue of what reform concessions he would  make to try to convince deeply skeptical European leaders to  lend Athens more money after five months of acrimonious and  fruitless negotiations with his leftist administration.
Even with the country on the brink of economic collapse,  Greek officials said the government was still seeking exceptions  from its reform pledges for special interests.
Athens wants to keep a 30 percent discount on value added  tax on Greek islands and delay defense spending from cuts, which  rightist junior coalition partners the Independent Greeks have  called "red lines." It is also resisting raising VAT on  restaurants to 23 percent, and wants to wait until 2019 to phase  out an income supplement for poorer pensioners, officials said.
Juncker told EU lawmakers he was working night and day to  get negotiations reopened and chided the Greeks for their  aggressive approach, saying it was unacceptable to accuse the EU  of behaving like "terrorists," as Varoufakis did last week.
"Throwing Greece out of the monetary union or indeed the  European Union is not something we want or indeed should want,"  the EU's chief executive said.
European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny suggested  the bank might be able to provide some sort of bridge funding  while Greece negotiated a longer-term conditional loan to see it  over a crucial July 20 bond redemption to the ECB.
Greek newspapers dramatized the make-or-break nature of the  Brussels showdown.
Centrist daily Ethnos headlined: "Time has run out for a  solution before catastrophe," while the center-right Eleftheros  Typos said: "Tsipras' games finish at today's council: Time of  crisis: deal or Grexit."
A clear majority of Greece's 18 partners favor a hard line  at the summit, arguing that they too are democracies and that  Greeks should not get easier money because they had rejected the  austerity terms, casting further doubt on whether they would  implement any reforms agreed now.
The ECB left unchanged its emergency liquidity lifeline for  Greek banks but raised the discount it charges on collateral  they present for funds - a measure banking sources said was  largely symbolic since the total they could borrow was capped.
A bank closure in force since the talks collapsed was  prolonged until Thursday at least, and cash withdrawals remain  limited to 60 euros a day, with 20 euro notes running out.
The Athens stock exchange was also ordered closed for two  days in Tuesday and Wednesday to throttle speculation.

ASSOCIATED PRESS
VIENNA (AP)  Iran nuclear talks busted through their second deadline in a week Tuesday, raising new questions about the ability of world powers to cut off all Iranian pathways to a bomb through diplomacy. The talks, already in their 12th day, were prolonged until possibly Friday.
"We knew it would have been difficult, challenging, and sometimes hard," said Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign policy chief. She said the negotiations would continue despite hitting some "tense" moments, and the State Department declared the current interim nuclear arrangement with Iran extended through July 10.
As the latest target date arrived for a deal setting a decade of restrictions on Iran's nuclear program, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and other top diplomats huddled in Vienna in search of a breakthrough.
All had spoken of deep differences remaining, and there was no public indication they had resolved disputes ranging from inspection rules on suspicious Iranian sites to limits on Tehran's research and development of advanced nuclear technology. Still, no one was speaking yet on Tuesday of a long-term extension.
"The last, difficult, political issues, we have to solve," Mogherini said.
And as he left the talks for an economic summit at home, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said fewer than 10 major differences needed to be ironed out, including access to Iranian sites for international monitors. He said questions related to the easing of sanctions on Iran had been decided, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. Lavrov said he could return to the talks later in the week.
Diplomats had extended their discussions by a week when they missed their goal of a pact by June 30, after passing previous deadlines in July 2014 and last November. For Kerry and his team, pressure is increasing from skeptical U.S. allies and members of Congress. If the accord isn't sent over to American lawmakers by Thursday, their month-long review period would be doubled to 60 days, hampering the ability of the Obama administration to offer speedy economic benefits to Iran for nuclear concessions.
In Tehran Tuesday, Iran's Atomic Energy Organization declared it had reached a "general understanding" in parallel talks with the U.N. nuclear agency on "joint cooperation." The Iranians have made similar claims previously, and it was unclear if any process was established for the International Atomic Energy Agency's long-stymied investigation of past nuclear weapons work by the Islamic Republic  a demand of Washington and its partners in negotiations in Austria's capital.
There, in a baroque, 19th-century palace, Kerry gathered early Tuesday with the foreign ministers of Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. The larger group was to meet with Zarif at some point later in the day. Russia's Lavrov and China's Wang Yi had to leave for a gathering of emerging economies in the Russian city of Ufa starting Wednesday, and the EU's Mogherini said different ministers were likely to depart and return.
"We are taking these negotiations day to day to see if we can conclude a comprehensive agreement," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement, adding that Kerry would remain in Vienna.
"We've made substantial progress in every area, but this work is highly technical and high stakes for all of the countries involved," Harf said. "We're frankly more concerned about the quality of the deal than we are about the clock, though we also know that difficult decisions won't get any easier with time. That is why we are continuing to negotiate."
The U.S. is in a tough spot. President Barack Obama has expended significant political capital on finalizing an agreement that has prompted suspicion from Iran's regional rival, Saudi Arabia, outright hostility from America's closest Mideast ally, Israel, and deep ambivalence even among Obama's Democratic allies in Congress. They're concerned that the accord would leave Iran's nuclear infrastructure largely intact and compel the West to provide the leading U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism with potentially hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of economic relief from international sanctions.
To ease their concerns, Obama and Kerry have vowed to hold out for a "good deal" that verifiably keeps Iran at least a year away from a nuclear weapons capability for at least a decade. Current intelligence estimates put the Iranians only two to three months away from amassing enough material for a nuclear warhead, if they pursued such a course. As part of the guarantee, the administration has repeatedly threatened to abandon negotiations if they prove fruitless or appear as an Iranian stall for time.
On-and-off talks with Tehran have been going on for more than a decade, though this incarnation has come closest to any resolution. The latest effort began in secret a couple of years ago and gained speed after the election of moderate-leaning Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2013. By November that year, Iran and the six world powers clinched an interim nuclear agreement and began the process for a comprehensive accord.
Over the weekend, a cautious Kerry told reporters that talks on the final package "could go either way."
Republicans hostile to compromise with Iran have been urging the U.S. to pull back from the talks. Their refrain has been that Obama and Kerry want a deal more than the Iranians do, and have let red lines erode on Iranian enrichment capacity, inspections and providing limited sanctions relief. The president and his top advisers vehemently reject such claims.
Iran has its own red lines, defiantly outlined in recent weeks by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the nation's supreme leader. They include a quick easing of sanctions, and rejection of any inspections of military sites or interviews with Iranian nuclear scientists.

"I am cautiously optimistic about this framework. We must always remain vigilant about preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon but there is no question that a diplomatic solution is vastly preferable to the alternatives. Now is the time for thoughtful consideration, not rash action that could undermine the prospects for success," Reid said in a statement. (AP Photo/John Locher)
"The president says negotiators have cleared the basic threshold needed to continue talks, but the parameters for a final deal represent an alarming departure from the White Houses initial goals. My longtime concerns about the parameters of this potential agreement remain, but my immediate concern is the administration signaling it will provide near-term sanctions relief," Boehner said in a statement. (AP Photo/Karim Kadim)
"This framework to roll back Irans nuclear program is founded not on trust, but on vigilance and enforcement.  Critically, this framework significantly restricts Irans enrichment capability and enables us to intensify our vigilance where it is needed most and that is inside Irans facilities.  The aggressive inspections and restrictions outlined in the preliminary framework offers a strong, long-term plan to stop Iran from building a bomb," Pelosi said in a statement. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)
"To the detriment of international security--specifically regarding the security of the United States, Israel and other allies, as well as preventing a nuclear arms race in the Middle East--the Obama administration has always approached the goal of these negotiations as reaching the best deal that is acceptable to Iran, rather than what should be our national goal: ending Iran's nuclear program," McConnell said in a statement. (AP Photo/Molly Riley)
"The understanding that the major world powers have reached with Iran is an important step toward a comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and strengthen the security of the United States, Israel, and the region," she said in the statement. "Getting the rest of the way to a final deal by June won't be easy, but it is absolutely crucial. I know well that the devil is always in the details in this kind of negotiation," Clinton said in a statement. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)
"The reported details of the Iran deal include significant concessions to a nation whose leaders call for death to America and the destruction of Israel. Iran remains a major destabilizing force in the region, working against American interests," Bush said in a statement. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley)
"Finding a negotiated solution, something that works, something that doesn't involve trusting, something that involves verifying that Iran is not moving toward developing a nuclear weapon, that is our best promise in the region. And so far, when everyone says they don't like this deal -- not everyone certainly, [but] the people who do say it -- the real question is, 'And what's the alternative here? What have you got as the next best move?'" Warren said during an appearance on "The HuffPost Show." (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)
"Under no circumstance should a U.S. President lift sanctions and grant nuclear capability to a nation that proudly chants Death to America.' It is unfortunate that throughout these negotiations the President continually reserved his harshest language not for the Iranian regime, but for the United States Congress and the Prime Minister of Israel," Cruz said in a statement.

"While much more work remains to be done this framework is an important step forward. It is imperative that Iran not get a nuclear weapon. It also is imperative that we do everything we can to reach a diplomatic solution and avoid never-ending war in the Middle East. I look forward to examining the details of this agreement and making sure that it is effective and strong," Sanders said in a statement. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)
"We cannot, and should not, divorce our nuclear diplomacy with Iran from the larger strategic challenge that Iran poses. I am concerned about the impact that todays agreement may have on the growing tensions and conflicts in the Middle Eastfor as Dr. Henry Kissinger has observed, the Administrations approach to nuclear diplomacy with Iran has moved from preventing proliferation to managing it," McCain said in a statement.

This is a very serious issue that deserves careful consideration, and I expect to have a classified briefing in the near future. I strongly believe Congress should have the right to disapprove any agreement and I support the Corker bill which would allow that to occur, Schumer said in an emailed statement to Politico.

A nuclear-armed Iran would lead to a less safe and less secure world, which is why the stakes are so high in the pursuit of a strong agreement that is fully enforceable, verifiable and is in our national security interests. It is important that we wait to see the specific details of todays announcement, and as the P5-plus-one works toward any final deal, we must remain clear-eyed regarding Irans continued resistance to concessions, long history of covert nuclear weapons-related activities, support of terrorism, and its current role in destabilizing the region. If a final agreement is reached, the American people, through their elected representatives, must have the opportunity to weigh in to ensure the deal truly can eliminate the threat of Irans nuclear program and hold the regime accountable," Corker said in a statement.

The United States  executive branch and Congress  are unified in our goal to ensure that Iran is blocked from ever having a nuclear weapon. The best outcome is a strong diplomatic one. This framework and the ultimate agreement cannot be based on trust; there is no trust when it comes to Iran. The final agreement must be verifiable and transparent, making it clear that any violations would result in an immediate restoration of the strongest possible sanctions. Congress has a role to play in this process and I look forward to reviewing all the details of this long-sought agreement that Secretary of State John Kerry and our allies have negotiated, Cardin said in a statement.

"I am very concerned by the extent of the sanctions relief that this announcement appears to offer Iran. Almost all congressionally-mandated sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program are also related to Tehran's advancing ballistic missile program, intensifying support for international terrorism, and other unconventional weapons programs. And I remain concerned regarding the ability to effectively re-impose sanctions once they have been weakened," Royce said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)
"Today's announcement is the culmination of months of negotiation and compromise. We now need to take a close look at the details to determine if the compromises made are worth the dismantling of years of pressure built on Iran. As I've said and again, no deal is better than a bad deal, and we need to ensure that this agreement forecloses any pathway to a bomb," Engel said in a statement. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)
This attempt to spin diplomatic failure as a success is just the latest example of this administrations farcical approach to Iran. Under this Presidents watch, Iran has expanded its influence in the Middle East, sowing instability throughout the region. Irans support for terrorism has continued unabated without a serious response from the United States. The regimes repression of the Iranian people and its detentions of American citizens continue. And now Tehran is gaining international acceptance of its nuclear ambitions and will receive significant sanctions relief without making serious concessions," Rubio said in a statement. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)
I welcome todays announcement that a framework understanding has been reached between Iran, the United States and our partners in the P5+1, and look forward to reviewing the details of the framework over the coming days. A comprehensive diplomatic agreement remains the best way to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and this agreement demonstrates the political will exists to complete a final deal by the July deadline," Murphy said in a statement. (AP Photo/Sergei Chuzavkov)
"If I ultimately choose to run, and if Im honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing  not just for the region but for this world  we need is a nuclear-armed Iran. It leaves not only problems for Israel, because they want to annihilate Israel, it leaves the problems in the sense that the Saudis, the Jordanians and others are gonna want to have access to their own nuclear weapons" Walker told Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)
"I'm encouraged to hear that negotiators have agreed to a frameworka major step toward achieving a final deal. Our shared goal in the United States is clear: to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The stakes couldn't be higher and I commend Secretary Kerry and our entire negotiating team for their commitment to finding a diplomatic solution that guarantees our security and that of our allies," Durbin said in a statement. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)
"The Obama Administration's efforts to get a deal at any cost, will have a greater cost than the world can bear. Iranian leaders will now find a nuclear weapon dangerously within reach. Even during these recent negotiations, Iranians have continued to chant "death to America". When people show you who they are, it's important to believe them the first time. If this deal moves forward the consequences for the US and our allies in the region will be dire," McCaul said in a statement.  (AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke)
"Americans want to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and they would prefer to do it through diplomacy rather than military action. This breakthrough agreement is an important step toward that goal. I believe that Congress now should give our negotiators time and space to work out the details of a strong, verifiable comprehensive agreement," Franken said in a statement. (AP Photo/Jim Mone)
"Based upon the statements made and press reports, there appears to be major confusion and uncertainty over exactly what the deal entails. There also appears to be major differences of opinion over what impact the deal will have on the Iranian's drive to develop a nuclear weapon. While I will reserve judgment until the details are known, it is notable how far from the White House's initial negotiating principals we appear to be. Given the magnitude of this potential agreement and based on the obvious conflicts in interpretation, it is increasingly imperative Congress review any deal before it is finalized and before congressional sanctions are lifted," Graham said in a statement.

        <Description>There's no such thing as an atheist, according to one of the stars of the reality TV show "</Description>
        <MainBody>

"I'm probably 20 percent atheist and 80 percent agnostic," Pitt said in 2009. "I don't think anyone really knows. You'll either find out or not when you get there, until then there's no point thinking about it." His prettier half, Jolie, said in 2000: "There doesn't need to be a God for me. There's something in people that's spiritual, that's godlike. I don't feel like doing things just because people say things, but I also don't really know if it's better to just not believe in anything, either."
"I'm an atheist, but I'm very relaxed about it," the "Harry Potter" star said in 2009. "I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do. Anything he does on television, I will watch."
In a 2002 interview on "Inside the Actor's Studio," Moore was asked as part of the series' questionnaire, "If heaven exists, what would you like God to say at the pearly gates?" She replied: "Well, I guess you were wrong. I do exist!"  (36:45)
In an interview in 2012, Bardem was quick to say "I've always said I don't believe in God, I believe in Al Pacino."
In a 2007 interview, Foster replied to the question of whether she's religious or not by saying "I'm an atheist. But I absolutely love religions and the rituals. Even though I don't believe in God. We celebrate pretty much every religion in our family with the kids. They love it, and when they say, 'Are we Jewish?' or 'Are we Catholic?' I say, 'Well, I'm not, but you can choose when you're 18. But isn't this fun that we do seders and the Advent calendar?'"
In 2012, when asked "Did we invent God?" Freeman replied "Yes." He then elaborated: "Has anybody ever seen hard evidence? What we get is theories from our earlier prophets. Now, people who think that God invented us think that the Earth can't be more than 6,000 years old. So I guess it's a question of belief. My belief system doesn't support a creator as such, as we can call God, who created us in His/Her/Its image."
"If only I wasn't an atheist, I could get away with anything," Knightley said in 2012. "You'd just ask for forgiveness and then you'd be forgiven."
"I'm an atheist," Thompson said in 2008. "I suppose you can call me a sort of libertarian anarchist. I regard religion with fear and suspicion. It's not enough to say that I don't believe in God. I actually regard the system as distressing: I am offended by some of the things said in the Bible and the Koran, and I refute them."
In 2010, Joel was a guest on Howard Stern's radio show and when asked if he believes in God, he replied: "No. I'm an atheist."
In the 2010 book "The Futurist," Cameron calls himself a "converted agnostic" and says "I've sworn off agnosticism, which I now call cowardly atheism. I've come to the position that in the complete absence of any supporting data whatsoever for the persistence of the individual in some spiritual form, it is necessary to operate under the provisional conclusion that there is no afterlife and then be ready to amend that if I find out otherwise."
In 2010, Garofalo compared the Bible to a Bill O'Reilly autobiography and a childrens book authored by former President Bush, saying: "That's just three works of fiction targeted to a child-like audience."
During her Emmy Award acceptance speech in 2007, Griffin said: "A lot of people come up here and they thank Jesus for this award. I want you to know that no one had less to do with this award than Jesus. He didn't help me a bit. If it was up to him, Cesar Millan would be up here with that damn dog. So all I can say is suck it Jesus, this reward is my God now."
In 2012, Hefner penned an editorial that said "when religion rather than reason dictates legislation, do not expect logic with your law," and: "This is a religious nation, but it is also a secular one. For decades the American people have found a way to balance religious beliefs with secular freedoms. We have enjoyed freedom of religion as well as freedom from religion. These need not be incompatible. No one should have to subjugate their religious freedom, and no one should have their personal freedoms infringed. This is America and we must protect the rights of all Americans."  Earlier this year, the prestigious Hugh Hefner award for those who protect the First Amendment went to a 16-year-old atheist who fought to have a prayer banner at her high school removed.

Nick Singer, the coordinator of a local atheists' group called "Coalition of Reason," recently received $5,250 from its national counterpart to erect the billboard along Interstate 44 near the Oklahoma State Fair.  Oklahoma ranks eighth in the nation for percentage of residents who self-identify as Christians (85 percent), according to an analysis of the 2008 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life.

"The impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous universe, with our conscious selves, arose through chance, seems to me the chief argument for  the existence of God."  Clarification: The full quote, from one of Darwin's letters, carries a different sentiment.  A young admirer asked Darwin about his religious views (the original inquiry is lost), and the great naturalist answered: "It is impossible to answer your question briefly; and I am not sure that I could do so, even if I wrote at some length. But I may say that the impossibility of conceiving that this grand and wondrous universe, with our conscious selves, arose through chance, seems to me the chief argument for the existence of God; but whether this is an argument of real value, I have never been able to decide."
"So you're made of detritus [from exploded stars]. Get over it. Or better yet, celebrate it. After all, what nobler thought can one cherish than that the universe lives within us all?"   --American astrophysicist and science commentator
"What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary."  --English physicist and cosmologist
"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual...The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both."   --American astrophysicist
"Science is...a powerful way, indeed - to study the natural world. Science is not particularly effective...in making commentary about the supernatural world. Both worlds, for me, are quite real and quite important. They are investigated in different ways. They coexist. They illuminate each other."  --American physician-geneticist and director of the National Human Genome Research Institute
"Emotionally, I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time"   --American biochemist and science fiction writer
Clarification: While the New York Times noted that "Einstein consistently characterized the idea of a personal God who answers prayers as naive, and life after death as wishful thinking," he also "described himself as an 'agnostic' and 'not an atheist.'" One ambiguous quote, from Einstein's response to a letter from a sixth-grade student named Phyllis Wright, reads "Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe - a spirit vastly superior to that of man, and one in the face of which we with our modest powers must feel humble. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more naive."  --German physicist, created theory of general relativity.
"It was not by accident that the greatest thinkers of all ages were deeply religious souls."  --German physicist, noted for work on quantum theory
"I am very astonished that the scientific picture of the real world around me is very deficient. It gives a lot of factual information, puts all our experiences in a magnificently consistent order, but is ghastly silent about all and sundry that is really near to our heart, that really matters to us. It cannot tell us a word about red and blue, bitter and sweet, physical pain and physical delight; it knows nothing of beautiful and ugly, good or bad, god and eternity."  --Austrian physicist, awarded Nobel prize in 1933
"In my view, all that is necessary for faith is the belief that by doing our best we shall come nearer to success and that success in our aims (the improvement of the lot of mankind, present and future) is worth attaining...I maintain that faith in this world is perfectly possible without faith in another world."   --British biophysicist renowned for her work on X-ray diffraction.
"From religion comes a man's purpose; from science, his power to achieve it. Sometimes people ask if religion and science are not opposed to one another. They are: in the sense that the thumb and fingers of my hands are opposed to one another. It is an opposition by means of which anything can be grasped."  --British physicist, chemist, and mathematician. Awarded Nobel Prize in 1915
"God was invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand."  --American physicist, awarded Nobel Prize in 1965
"I find it as difficult to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science."   --German-American rocket scientist
"The more you understand the significance of evolution, the more you are pushed away from the agnostic position and towards atheism. Complex, statistically improbable things are by their nature more difficult to explain than simple, statistically probable things."   --British evolutionary biologist
"Science can have a purifying effect on religion, freeing it from beliefs of a pre-scientific age and helping us to a truer conception of God. At the same time, I am far from believing that science will ever give us the answers to all our questions."  --English physicist, awarded Nobel Prize in 1977
"A commonsense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question."  --English mathematician and astronomer.
"Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the nonexistence of Zeus or Thor - but they have few followers now"   --British science fiction author and inventor
"I am very much a scientist, and so I naturally have thought about religion also through the eyes of a scientist. When I do that, I see religion not denominationally, but in a more, let us say, deistic sense. I have been influence in my thinking by the writing of Einstein who has made remarks to the effect that when he contemplated the world he sensed an underlying Force much greater than any human force. I feel very much the same. There is a sense of awe, a sense of reverence, and a sense of great mystery."  --American theoretical physicist, awarded Nobel Prize in 1998
"Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply a refusal to deny the obvious."  --American neuroscientist
"With pantheism...the deity is associated with the order of nature or the universe itself...when modern scientists such as Einstein and Stephen Hawking mention 'God' in their writing, this is what they seem to mean: that God is Nature."   --American physicist

ASSOCIATED PRESS
PAMPLONA, Spain (AP)  Two Americans and a Briton were gored and eight others injured Tuesday as thousands of daredevils dashed alongside fighting bulls through the streets of this northern Spanish city on the first bull run of the San Fermin festival, organizers said.
The San Fermin press office said a 38-year-old American identified only by his initials, M.W.O., was gored in the armpit and a 27-year-old Californian identified by the initials D.M.O. was also gored. A 30-year-old Briton with the initials A.B.O. was gored in the groin area. None of the three was said to be in serious condition.
Three other Americans were among the eight others injured, most with bruises sustained in falls and crowd crushes during the nationally-televised run that lasted just over two minutes.
In its first report after the run, the Spanish Red Cross only had details of one person being gored and six people injured.
The daily run sees people dashing with six bulls along a narrow, 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city's bull ring. The bulls are then killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon. The nine-day fiesta in Pamplona, which features 24-hour street partying, was made famous in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel "The Sun Also Rises" and attracts thousands of foreign tourists.
Bull runs are a traditional part of summer festivals across Spain. Dozens of people are injured each year in the runs, most in falls.
Two men have died recently after being gored by bulls in Spanish festivals  one Saturday in the eastern town of Grao de Castellon and another June 24 in the southwestern town of Coria.
In all, 15 people have died from gorings in San Fermin since record-keeping began in 1924.

        <title>Friends of Tibet in Lithuania Celebrate the Dalai Lama</title>

Friends of Tibet in Lithuania celebrated the 80th Birthday of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama on June 19 in Vilnius. This celebration became a part of the huge traditional cultural event called "Culture Night" which was held in Vilnius that night. The citizens of Vilnius and the guests of the city had a unique opportunity to attend different cultural places and various performances overnight; streets of Vilnius were therefore crowded till dawn.
It was a good opportunity to invite a lot of different people to celebrate the jubilee of His Holiness and to present Tibetan culture a few cultural events under the common name "The House of Tibet at the Culture Night" were organized by Tibet supporters. The visitors had an opportunity to paint mandalas, to taste traditional salt Tibetan tea and some snacks, to watch documentaries about Tibetan culture, Tibetan political situation, relations between Lithuania and Tibet and visits of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama to Lithuania. The last film was screened before 4 AM and a lot of people watched the program. The event was arranged at Tibet Square which was established by friends of Tibet in the popular district of artists and art called Uzupis in 2010. His Holiness consecrated the Tibet Square and the "Mandala" sculptural composition in the center of the Square during his last visit to Lithuania in 2013.
When His Holiness celebrated the 80th birthday on June 22 (according to Tibetan lunar calendar) in Dharamsala, Tibet supporters with Tibet flags and banners reminded the Tibet issue to Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhang Gaoli, who visited Vilnius those days.
It's worthwhile to remind here about some coincidences in the history of Lithuania and Tibet and some facts concerned with relations between Lithuania and Tibet in recent decades. As Tibet by PRC in 1949, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviets in 1940. The same narration was used by occupants in both cases -- Lithuanians were "liberated," as well as Tibetans. After decades of struggle and suffers under occupation Lithuania declared independence on March 11, 1990. On April 3 -- after 24 days -- the Chairman of Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) Prof. Vytautas Landsbergis received a telegram from His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama. His Holiness congratulated Lithuania on the independence and expressed his strong support of the peaceful struggle which was chosen by Lithuanians on their way to freedom.
In October 1991, His Holiness visited Lithuania for the first time and addressed Lithuanian people at the Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas). It was a real and a very strong support for young Independence - very few countries recognized Lithuania at that time and the visit of world known person, the Nobel Prize winner was really important for the return of Lithuania to the world map. Since then we have strong Tibet support traditions in our country - there was the Group of Parliamentarian Relations with Tibet in the Lithuanian Parliament during all years of independence. And since 1994 we have had the informal Tibet Freedom Movement, which was initiated by the famous late Lithuanian writer -- the author of the trilogy about Tibet -- Jurga Ivanauskaite. After the first visit in 1991, His Holiness visited Lithuania two more times in 2001and 2013. And every time thousands of Lithuanian people came to listen to his public talks and just to enjoy meeting with him.
It was announced by media that His Holiness joked at Dharamsala that he will celebrate his 90th Birthday at this place again. We strongly believe that he will -- but not at the same place. We hope that we will be able to send our greetings to Lhasa.
Long live the Dalai Lama!
Free Tibet!

        <title>Greece Is Just The Beginning Of The Great Austerity Backlash</title>

WASHINGTON -- The global politics of austerity seeped into the press room of the White House on Monday, the day after the Greeks voted overwhelmingly to reject a harsh bailout deal with Europe.
Reporters pressed Josh Earnest, President Barack Obamas spokesman, for details of what his boss thought of the vote and of the bailout deal, and whether he agreed with 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders that the latter was outrageous. Earnest answered with streams of polite words that added up to ... nothing. Obama was staying out of the issue, as he apparently had promised German Chancellor Angela Merkel he would when they met at the G-7 summit recently.
Obama favors a package of relief and reform, was all Earnest would say.
Nevertheless, the exchange with reporters in Washington was another of the many signs that the debate over the power that should accrue to money -- and what those who wield it can fairly demand -- is spreading around the world.
Its a new echo on a global scale of the politics of a much earlier, but in some ways remarkably similar, era in the U.S. As the U.S. became a continental economy in the late 19th century, with vast new hordes of wealth built in railroads, coal, electricity and communications, a political backlash arose. The new money power was judged too big and uncontrollable: an engine not of prosperity, but of inequality and corruption. The backlash launched America's Progressive movement, which among other reforms pushed laws to rein in the power of big corporationsin the interests of ordinary people.
Now that the planets economies have essentially become one, and the worlds top dozen banks control $30 trillion in assets, the callous demands of a new and even larger money power is starting to spark a worldwide backlash.
Even the ever-cautious Obama has alluded to it. This past winter, he defended Greece , saying that you cant keep squeezing countries that are in the midst of depression to pay off debt and warning that "eventually the political system, the society cant sustain it.
Around the same time, he sent the U.S. Congress a budget proposal with many new spending plans, declaring that it was time to end the mindless austerity of his Republican foes. They responded by proposing their stingiest budget plan in years.
This fall, Obama will again be battling the Republican Party over cutting spending to reduce debt -- even as he declines to get involved in the more intense version of the same debate going on in Europe.
Europe, meanwhile, is likely to see the Greek anti-austerity sentiment spread -- in the first instance to Portugal and Spain, which have national elections this fall and winter, respectively. Governments in both countries are responding to heavy borrowing and debt with controversial austerity measures sure to be at issue with the voters. French and Italian national elections are much further away, but the leftist parties in each nation have been invigorated by the fight in Athens. Representatives of parties and movements in all four countries were on the scene in Greece this week, cheering on the Syriza party and trying to learn from its victories and mistakes.
The leftists face long odds despite growing evidence that what British economist John Maynard Keynes warned during the Great Depression (and what Obama said this winter) remains true: You cant squeeze a country into prosperity. Just the opposite, in fact.
This was something the founders of the International Monetary Fund understood. Their original aim was to provide guidance to national governments in economic distress but also to feed in more money where needed, not cut it back. Today the IMF has become something akin to a collection agency, insisting on harsh measures that guarantee the repayment of loans made to vulnerable countries by private global banks.
Something has to change, as the Greeks declared with their vote this weekend.

        <title>Putting the Dalai Lama's Lessons to the Test</title>

After spending two extremely intimate weeks with the Dalai Lama, making his award winning film ROAD TO PEACE, Leon Stuparich wanted to take the Dalai Lama's message of peace and put it to the test. The Dalai Lama says that "peace starts within, and peace can only happen through action." So Leon decided to leave his home comforts of city life, and set himself the challenge to walk 200 miles in the ancient tradition of pilgrims, without spending money, taking food or water, and seeing if he could rely on the kindness and generosity of strangers to survive this epic journey of discovery. As a non-Buddhist, what he has learned has changed his perspective on life forever.
Overwhelmingly, people say they love the Dalai Lama because of his integrity. But what does that mean? And how can we live in the same way? How can we concretely learn from his teachings?
When I shot a documentary on the Dalai Lama, the people I interviewed about his message constantly expressed how honest and truthful he is. How there is a lack of duality in his message. He is the same person behind the scenes as he is on stage. He is the same when he meets a prime minister or president as when he shakes hands with a stranger on the street.
My first morning back from my 2-week long pilgrimage for peace, I am buying morning coffees when I realize: I messed up.
I wanted seeing my kids to be the first thing I did when I returned. However, exhausted and still in a whirl, I quickly became engulfed in the stress of my busy work life.
As I walk to my regular coffee cart, I find myself walking slower than usual. I'm still digesting the pilgrimage, a journey that blended ancient and modern trails. We pioneered a new pilgrimage route along the Thames Path and The Ridgeway, at times we were wild camping, and at others we had no idea where we were go to sleep or what we going to eat. But with faith, a good map, and a large amount of fortitude, we survived the epic journey with little more than a few bad blisters on our feet. Now home, I'm walking another path that I've walked hundreds of times before -- to and from the coffee cart -- but after walking penniless for two weeks, these steps today are some of the most striking.
Maybe it's the contrast of walking this route before and after the pilgrimage, maybe it's the act of spending money again. I think it's more likely that last night I had my first good sleep in weeks and today I woke up with the striking clarity of how much I miss my family. I say to myself, "Today I will see my family no matter what."
As I stand in the queue for coffee, I realize that the explanation that "we're pilgrims on a penniless journey" is no longer required. That story we had to tell again and again for two weeks, in order to get food or shelter, is no longer my story. That story was who I was for a while.
Which is when a little bell rings in my head and I finally realize what I mean by "story" and where it fits in with the Dalai Lama's integrity that so many people talk about:
Your story is your ego.
The story of the penniless pilgrim is one we created by going on the 200 mile walk. It was necessary to survive -- without it we would have starved. People loved the story. They loved our journey and we were taken in with so much love and kindness -- our story defined us.
Maybe, the story we tell ourselves and other people is not simply our ego -- it's the story we write to define our lives. In this case, the story you write is how other people read you. If you make up a false story -- a story of something you are not genuinely doing or being, then people will instinctively see through it. If your story genuinely reflects your heart and who you truly are as a person -- if it's a story of love and kindness -- then you are seen to have integrity.
So, what makes up a whole person? Perhaps it is a combination of our inner values and the ego story we tell ourselves. Is this what defines us in life? Is this what determines whether we are a success or failure? Is this how we ensure we live our lives to the fullest and live in our own integrity?
If we can identify our own individual inner values (what makes us happy, who and how we love, etc.) and express that through the story we tell of ourselves, then maybe life can open up and be the miracle it has the potential to be.
Realizing this, at the coffee cart, I am struck by the fact that, though I seem to have just arrived home from my "big journey," in fact it is just the beginning of a new journey for me. This journey is one of embarking upon understanding my own "story" and becoming comfortable with it. I can feel a skip of joy as I write this because I know I've never had the confidence to hear my own story.
If this is my lesson from working with the Dalai Lama's principles for seven years and going on a 200 mile journey, then I am infinitely grateful. The power of writing your own story -- with the help of others -- is an incredible concept.
It's always been my hope that the work I do will inspire other people. Whilst walking alone on the Ridgeway, Britain's most ancient road, during the pilgrimage I realised we are all walking together as one human family. If one person is inspired, we are all a little more inspired. This is why the story we tell ourselves and the stories that people say about us are so important.
Do you believe what others say about you?
During the two weeks filming with the Dalai Lama, one of the most surprising things was his approach on self-confidence and determination. Not something I'd previously considered as part of creating peace. In an interview he gave me, he said, "Buddha taught: don't care what other people say. When one person says something critical then you should think: some people are praising me. When someone says a lot of praise, then you should think: I also have the critics. So it doesn't matter. As long as your own intention is honest, sincere. That's important. Paying too much attention to these things is silly."
Ignore the stories other people create for you. Receive them as a reflection of the story you're expressing, but don't let those external stories completely rewrite or change your own personal expression of your self. The power is within the story. The story is the conduit through which we connect to each other.
On the walk we naturally slowed down, and when we stopped to meet people, or they took up the pilgrimage and walked along with us for a while, the most powerful moments were always in hearing other people's stories. Listening. Now, in retrospect, it was as if we were listening to their hearts. If we are too busy to listen to the story, if we are too engrossed in our own stories to make the space needed in ourselves to receive the stories of others, it's the same as saying that we don't care or we don't have time for anyone but ourselves.
If your life is dominated by your story and there is a lack of actual expression -- integrity of your actions with your story -- then your story is unbalanced and people stop listening. If you just take action and don't express what you're doing -- or you're uncomfortable in expressing it -- then it's harder for people to read.
Do what you say. And say what you do.
Your story informs your actions in a symbiotic relationship, but if the story doesn't start from your own heart and an understanding of your own nurtured inner values, then you're going to fall over!
Of all the lessons I have learned from the Dalai Lama, this is the most powerful so far: to live in your own integrity. To live honestly, with self confidence. To explore your inner values and deepen those and then live life from these values.
It certainly isn't easy, but walking the pilgrimage and putting my own values into action -- largely by going penniless -- has taught me that only through taking action, and the intention behind the action, can we really learn and therefore hopefully create a lasting change within ourselves and the world in which we live.
Today I hope this insight will inspire others and create a little more peace and love in the world.
