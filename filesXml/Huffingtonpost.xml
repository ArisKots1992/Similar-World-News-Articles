DUBAI, June 26 (Reuters) - Militant group Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a Shi'ite mosque in Kuwait that killed or wounded several people, according a statement posted on social media.
The statement identified the bomber as Abu Suleiman al-Muwahed and said the target was a "temple of the rejectionists" - a term used by the Islamist militant group to refer to Shi'ite Muslims - and said dozens were killed or wounded.

        <MainBody>Climate Change: Ten Beautiful Places Under Threat
of


The impacts of climate warming in Alaska are already occurring, experts have warned.   Over the past 50 years, temperatures across Alaska increased by an average of 3.4F.   Winter warming was even greater, rising by an average of 6.3F jeopardising its famous glaciers and frozen tundra.
The most fragile of Italian cities has been sinking for centuries. Long famous for being the city that is partially under water, sea level rise associated with global warming would have an enormous impact on Venice and the surrounding region.   The Italian government has begun constructing steel gates at the entrances to the Venetian lagoon, designed to block tidal surges from flooding the city. However, these barriers may not be enough to cope with global warming.
The West Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming areas on Earth, with only some areas of the Arctic Circle experiencing faster rising temperatures.   Over the past 50 years, temperatures in parts of the continent have jumped between 5 and 6 degrees F a rate five times faster than the global average.  A 2008 report commissioned by WWF warned that if global temperatures rise 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial averages, sea ice in the Southern Ocean could shrink by 10 to 15 percent.
The rapid decline of the world's coral reefs appears to be accelerating, threatening to destroy huge swathes of marine life unless dramatic action is swiftly taken, leading ocean scientists have warned.   About half of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed over the past 30 years, as climate change warms the sea and rising carbon emissions make it more acidic.
The world's highest mountain range contains the planet's largest non-polar ice mass, with over 46,000 glaciers.   The mammoth glaciers cross eight countries and are the source of drinking water, irrigation and hydroelectric power for roughly 1.5 billion people. And just like in Antarctica, the ice is melting.
An expected 2C rise in the worlds average temperatures in the next decades will impact island economies such as the Maldives with extreme weather patterns and rising sea levels.
Over the last century, global warming has caused all Alpine glaciers to recede. Scientists predict that most of the glaciers in the Alps could be gone by 2050.   Global warming will also bring about changes in rain and snowfall patterns and an increase in the frequency of extreme meteorological events, such as floods and avalanches, experts have warned.
The Arctic is ground zero for climate change, warming at a rate of almost twice the global average.    The sea ice that is a critical component of Arctic marine ecosystems is projected to disappear in the summer within a generation.
Called the "epicenter of the current global extinction," by Conservation International, this smattering of more than 4,000 South Pacific islands is at risk from both local human activity and global climate change.

ATHENS/FRANKFURT, June 28 (Reuters) - Greece said it may impose capital controls and keep its banks shut on Monday after creditors refused to extend the country's bailout and savers queued to withdraw cash, taking Athens' standoff with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund to a dangerous new level.
Greece's banks, kept afloat by emergency central bank funding, are on the front line as Athens moves towards defaulting on a 1.6 billion euros payment due to the IMF on Tuesday.
The European Central Bank said it would not raise the level of emergency funding, adding to the pressure on Greece's banks which have been surviving for the past few weeks on frequent incremental increases to the funding lifeline
Amid political drama in Greece, where a clear majority wants to remain inside the euro, the next few days present a major challenge to the integrity of a 16-year-old currency bloc.
"This is a matter that we'll have to work overnight on with the appropriate authorities both here in Greece and in Frankfurt," Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said of bank closures and capital controls. He was speaking to BBC radio.
The finance ministry later issued a statement saying capital controls were not the government's preference and were not consistent with monetary union.

Greece's left-wing Syriza government had been negotiating a deal to release funding in time for its IMF payment. Then suddenly, in the early hours of Saturday, Prime Minster Alexis Tspiras asked for extra time to enable Greeks to vote in a referendum on the terms of the deal.
Creditors flatly turned down this request, leaving little option for Greece but to default, piling further pressure on the banking system.
Long lines formed outside many ATMs on Sunday, including some of 40 to 50 people outside some in central Athens. The German foreign ministry issued a travel warning advising tourists heading to Greece to take plenty of cash to avoid possible problems with local banks.
The Bank of Greece said it was making "huge efforts" to ensure the machines remained stocked.
The ECB said in a statement on Sunday it was keeping its emergency liquidity at current levels but was monitoring the situation and stood ready "to reconsider its decision."
There is growing opposition in some European countries to extending the ECB's funding line.
In economic powerhouse Germany, other southern states that have suffered austerity in return for EU cash and poor eastern countries with living standards much lower than Greece's, many voters and politicians have run out of patience.
If Greece were to leave the euro zone, the ECB's funding line, which is a form of overdraft with euro zone's central bank system, would fall to the bloc's other members to pay.
The head of Germany's Bundesbank has attacked the use of the ECB's funding line and speaking on German television on Saturday, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble put a question mark over the solvency of Greek banks - a key condition to qualify to receive such finance.
"The ECB has always said that as long as Greek banks are solvent, then emergency loans, the ELA, can be granted," he said.
"And now there is naturally a new situation that because of the developments the liquidity and solvency of Greek banks, or some Greek banks, could be in doubt."
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has invited leaders of all the major German parties to a meeting in Berlin on Monday to discuss the crisis.

DEAL STILL POSSIBLE
The 18 other countries sharing the euro countries have blamed Greece for breaking off negotiations and pledged to do whatever it takes to stabilize the common currency area.
But some officials said there was still time to return to the negotiating table.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls on Sunday urged the Greeks to continue talks, warning that the country's membership of the euro was at stake.
"A deal is still possible, I invite the Greek government to come back to the negotiation table," Valls told Europe 1, Le Monde and iTELE in a joint interview. "I cannot resign myself to Greece leaving the euro zone ... We must find a solution."
International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde told the BBC that there was still time for the Greek government to change course.
She also said that if the July 5 vote produced "a resounding yes" to remain in the euro and fix the Greek economy then the creditors would be willing to make an effort.
Pro-European Greek opposition parties have united in condemning the decision to call the referendum. There was rising speculation that Tsipras' left-wing government may have to resign if voters back the bailout in the referendum.
The offer from creditors requires Greece to cut pensions and raise taxes in ways that Tsipras has long argued would deepen one of the worst economic crises of modern times in a country where a quarter of the workforce is already unemployed.
European Council President Donald Tusk said on Sunday he was in contact with all the governments of the euro zone to ensure Greece remained in the single currency.   (Editing by Alastair Macdonald and Janet McBride)

VIENNA, June 28 (Reuters) - The six world powers seeking to negotiate an historic agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program plan to carry on negotiating beyond a Tuesday deadline, a senior U.S. official said on Sunday.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was to leave Vienna and return to Tehran for consultations with the country's leadership on the state of negotiations, Iran said.
Officials from both sides said big differences still remained.
European Union foreign policy chief Frederica Mogherini said earlier on Sunday it was not impossible to get an accord by the self-imposed deadline but that a few extra days may be needed.
Foreign ministers from the negotiating countries were gathering in Vienna on Sunday to assess where the talks stood.  They expected them to spill over into July.
"Zarif will return to Tehran tonight and will come back to Vienna tomorrow," Iran's Tasnim news agency said, citing an unnamed Iranian official.
An Iranian official told Reuters that Zarif would "consult with the leadership" over the talks in Vienna.
The U.S. official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, said Washington was not troubled by Zarif's decision to return to Tehran overnight, saying it was always expected that ministers would come and go from Vienna as the talks heated up.
The negotiations aim to limit Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for a lifting of U.S., European Union and United Nations sanctions on Tehran.
The United States, Israel and some Western nations fear that Iran has been trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability, but Tehran says its program is for peaceful purposes only.
The main differences are on the pace and timing of sanctions relief for Iran and on the nature of monitoring mechanisms to ensure Tehran does not cheat on any agreement.
U.S. and European negotiators also want to ensure there is a mechanism for restoring sanctions if Tehran fails to meet its commitments under any future accord.
In November, the seven nations involved in the talks set a late March deadline for a framework agreement, which they ultimately reached on April 2, and a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal.
Highlighting how much work remains, British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond said on arrival in Vienna that major challenges remained, including on the parameters already agreed in April.
"There are a number of different areas where we still have major differences of interpretation in detailing what was agreed in Lausanne)," Hammond told reporters.
"There is going to have to be some give or take if we are to get this done in the next few days," he said. "No deal is better than a bad deal."
In addition to Britain, Iran and the United States, the talks include China, France, Germany and Russia.
Speaking after a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said too many concessions were being made to Tehran.
"We see before our very eyes a stark retreat from the red lines that the world powers set themselves only recently, and publicly," said Netanyahu, whose country is generally believed to have the Middle East's only nuclear arsenal.
"There is no reason to hasten into signing this bad deal, which is getting worse by the day."

PARIS, June 28 (Reuters) - The suspected Islamist militant  held over an attack against a French chemical plant has admitted  killing his boss, a source close to the investigation said on  Sunday.
Yassin Salhi, 35, told detectives he had killed Herve  Cornara in a parking area before arriving at the plant in Saint  Quentin-Fallavier, 30 km (20 miles) south of Lyon, where he  attempted to cause an explosion on Friday, the source told  Reuters.
Police found the 54-year-old victim's decapitated body and  head, framed by Islamic inscriptions, at the plant owned by U.S.  group Air Products. There were no other casualties.
Examination of one of Salhi's mobile phones revealed that he  took a "selfie" with the severed head before his arrest and sent  the image via a messaging application to a Canadian phone  number. Canadian police are now investigating.
According to French media reports, Salhi told police he had  clashed with his boss as well as his own wife before the  killing. One of their work colleagues, quoted on the website of  television station i-Tele, also said the two men had argued days  earlier after Salhi dropped a pallet of fragile equipment.
The suspect, whose wife and sister are also being  questioned, is known to have associated with hardline Islamists  over more than a decade and had previously been flagged by  French security services as a potential risk.
Earlier on Sunday, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said  the government was increasing resources in law enforcement and  domestic intelligence to combat Islamic extremism.
"We cannot lose this war, because it is essentially a war of  civilisation," Valls said in an interview broadcast on Europe 1  radio and i-Tele. "It is our society, our civilisation and our  values that we must defend."     (Reporting by Gregory Blachier, Writing by Laurence Frost,;  Editing by Angus MacSwan)

Pope Francis asked forgiveness on Monday for the Roman Catholic Church's "non-Christian and inhumane" treatment in the past of the Waldensians, a tiny Protestant movement the Vatican tried to exterminate in the 15th century.
Francis made his plea during the first ever visit by a pope to a Waldensian temple on the second day of a trip to Italy's northern Piedmont region, the centre of the Waldensian Church, which has only about 30,000 followers worldwide.
While the movement is miniscule compared to the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church, the gesture is part of Francis' drive to promote Christian unity and it has taken on added significance ahead of the 500th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation in 2017.
"On behalf of the Catholic Church, I ask forgiveness for the un-Christian and even inhumane positions and actions taken against you historically," he said. "In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, forgive us!"
The Waldensians, who now live mostly in Italy and Latin America, were founded by Peter Waldo in France in the late 12th century. He gave up his wealth and preached poverty but as the movement grew it came into increasing theological conflict with the papacy.
The movement, an early precursor of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, was branded as heretical and in 1487 Pope Innocent VIII ordered its extermination.
Some 1,700 Waldensians were killed in 1655 by Catholic forces commanded by the Duke of Savoy.
Today the Waldensians are part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches and the World Council of Churches. They have
only two sacraments -- baptism and the Lord's Supper -- as opposed to seven in the Roman Catholic Church, a member of the Italian branch said.
During a visit to Jerusalem in 2000, Francis' predecessor Pope John Paul II asked forgiveness from Jews for their persecution by Catholics over the centuries.
In 2017, Christians will mark the 500th anniversary of the launching of the Protestant Reformation by Martin Luther, who nailed his 95 Theses to a church door in Germany to denounce corruption in the Catholic Church.
Various Christian churches have still not agreed on how they will jointly mark the divorce that split western Christianity and led to many bloody religious wars.
The head of the Protestant Church in Germany, Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, has said he would be in favour of inviting the pope to a "joint Christian festival" to mark the anniversary.
Francis, an Argentinian whose father and grandfather were born in the Turin area, wrapped up his two-day visit to the region with a private lunch with his Italian relatives.

A mere two weeks after he was announced as pontiff, Francis washed and kissed the feet of 12 prisoners incarcerated in Rome as part of the traditional Holy Thursday rite. The unorthodox component of the ceremony was the inclusion of two women, one of whom was a Muslim. This show of acceptance and compassion was just a hint at what was to come, as the pope has continued to make statements about the importance of interfaith understanding as well as the importance of a greater role for women in the church. Francis sent personal Eid al-Fitr holiday greetings to Muslims around the world, rather than relying on his office to do so in a show of care and good will that hasn't happened since Pope John Paul II sent a similar personal message in 1991.
Soon after he became pope, Francis tweeted, "The pope must serve all people, especially the poor, the weak, the vulnerable," and he's made sure to personally do so by comforting and greeting the sick after his weekly general audiences in St. Peter's Square. He moved many hearts, as pictures of him tenderly embracing and kissing some severely disfigured men showed his human concern for all people, especially the marginalized.
Pope Francis refused to live in the luxurious papal apartments located in the Apostolic Palace and prefers to live in more modest accommodations to show his personal commitment to humility and encourage other leaders to follow suit. He's also gained notice for his unusual choice of a car -- a humble Ford Focus with a starting sticker price of only about $16,000. He can rarely be seen in the ostentatious vestments that he could certainly wear as pope and  prefers his usual garments of a simple white hat and robe. He's always done so -- when he still lived in Argentina, he gave up his chauffeur and took the bus to work.
Arriving at World Youth Day, Pope Francis had rock-star appeal, as thousands of young people swarmed his car after it took a wrong turn. Though the mob of excited youth alarmed his security staff with the frenzy of their excitement, "the pope was happy, with his hand out the window waving," said a Vatican spokesman. World Youth Day was a great success, and this pope seems particularly in tune with the younger generation.
Pope Francis has given a 17-year-old boy with Down Syndrome the ride of his life  sort of.  Francis invited Alberto di Tullio up onto his open-top Mercedes at the end of his general audience Wednesday, letting him spin around on the pontiff's white chair while tens of thousands of people looked on.

'Harry Potter And The Cursed Child' To Hit London Stage In 2016; Play Tells 'Untold' Story, J.K. Rowling Says
reddit
Harry Potter fans, hold onto your broomsticks. An untold part of the boy wizards story will soon be revealed.
Author J.K. Rowling confirmed on Twitter Friday that a play, entitled  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , will be opening in London next year.
It will tell a new story, Rowling wrote, later adding: I dont want to say too much more, because I dont want to spoil what I know will be real treat for fans.
Rowling stressed, however, that the play will not be a prequel.
I'm also very excited to confirm today that a new play called Harry Potter and the #CursedChild will be opening in London next year.
 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 26, 2015
It will tell a new story, which is the result of a collaboration between writer Jack Thorne, director John Tiffany and myself. #CursedChild

I don't want to say too much more, because I don't want to spoil what I know will be a real treat for fans. #CursedChild
 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 26, 2015
However, I can say that it is not a prequel! #CursedChild
 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 26, 2015
To answer one inevitable (and reasonable!) question - why isn't #CursedChild a new novel? - I am confident that when audiences see the play
 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 26, 2015
they will agree that it was the only proper medium for the story. #CursedChild
 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 26, 2015
I've had countless offers to extend Harry's story over the years, but Jack, John and Sonia Friedman are a dream team! #CursedChild
 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) June 26, 2015
It has been a huge pleasure to share with them (and soon, with you!) this untold part of Harry's story. #CursedChild
According to The Daily Mail, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child may detail the lives of Harrys parents, James and Lily , before they were killed by Lord Voldemort.
The play may also look at the complicated relationship between siblings Lily and Petunia, the news outlet wrote. Petunia, and her husband Vernon, were the muggles (non-magical people) who raised Harry after he was orphaned.
The play is slated to open in the summer of 2016 at the Palace Theatre on Londons West End, Entertainment Weekly writes. Tickets will reportedly go on sale in the fall.

'Harry Potter': Where Are They Now?

Since appearing as the movies' title character, Daniel has managed to shake off Harry and ensure he's known by his own name - which has been aided by the fact he'll happily get his kit off on-screen and on-stage.   After stints in the West End and on Broadway, Daniel recently starred in 'What If', and in 2015, fans will see him take on the role of Igor in 'Frankenstein'.
Since hanging up his wizard's hat, Rupert has made waves on the West End stage, and in 2013 he received rave reviews for his performance in 'Mojo'.  He also stowed some his 'Harry Potter' cash away and splashed it on an ice cream truck, fulfilling a childhood dream. Aww!
You'll find Ralph in 'Wrath of the Titans', 'Skyfall' and 'Great Expectations'. It has also been announced he's been cast in the upcoming, as-yet-unnamed, James Bond film.
Sadly, Jamie hasn't fared too well in recent years and in 2012 he was imprisoned after participating in the 2011 London riots.
Sadly, Joshua hasn't faired too well either, and has dropped off the radar as far as acting is concerned.
After being everyone's favourite bad guy in the films, Tom decided to try something a little different and recorded a number of singles, which he shared with fans via YouTube.   He's currently filming 'Clavius', where he stars as a character called Lucius. Tom's also really, really good at Twitter.
After getting surprisingly dishy, Matthew now spends his time reminding everyone that he's also hugely talented, making his West End debut in 2012 alongside Arthur Darvill and Laurence Fox in 'Our Boys'.   Matthew also took part in one of the best editions of Innuendo Bingo ever on Scott Mills' Radio 1 show.
Bonnie was one of the 'Harry Potter' frachise's younger stars, however, that hasn't stopped her from going on to carve a successful career.   While she hasn't quite achieved the worldwide success of the films' leading stars, Bonnie has been applauded for her work as a model and actress. She also writes and directs her own screen plays.
To be honest, Rob's had a rather quiet life since his character's exit left us weeping in the 'Goblet Of Fire' film.   After a lot of digging, Robert's main achievement seems to be another franchise entitled 'Twilight'. Nope, we've never heard of it either...
Julie is one of the many huge names who appeared in the 'Harry Potter' films so it's not like her career needed the boost.   Since the final film in 2011, Julie's been praised by critics her roles in a whole host of other movies, including voicing the witch in Disney's 'Brave'.
Michael is rumoured to be reprising his role in the upcoming wizrding flick 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'.   He also plays Howard Mollison in the TV adaptation of JK's novel 'A Casual Vacancy'.
Already a legend, Dame Maggie Smith continues to win fans with her performance as the Dowager Countess in hit TV series 'Downton Abbey'.   She's also no stranger to the big screen, and starred in 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' and is set to feature in the upcoming sequel.
Amongst other projects, John has completed three where he was cast alongside other 'Harry Potter' stars; 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy', 'The Gruffalo's Child' and 'Labyrinth'.
Since 'Harry Potter', method actor Alan has been part of several projects including 'CBGB', alongside his former co-star Rupert Grint.
After providing the voice of everybody's favourite House Elf, Toby's projects included 'The Hunger Games', 'Snow White and the Huntsman' and 'The Adventures of Tintin'.
Once filming wrapped, Robbie moved over to the Dark Side and joined Voldemort's gang. By which we mean, starred alongside Ralph Fiennes, in 'Great Expectations'.   Traitor.
Oh Kenneth, where do we start?   Ever since *that* version of 'Hamlet', Brannagh has been one of our favourite stars to swoon over.   Since leaving the Wizarding World, Kenneth has turned his attention to directing, as well as starring in flicks such as 'My Week With Marilyn' and 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit'.
In between stints studying for a degree at Brown University in the US, Emma starred in a number of blockbusters including 'The Bling Ring' and 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'.   Shortly after graduating in 2013, it was announced that Emma has accepted a UN post and will serve as a Women's Goodwill Ambassador.
Gary's a very busy man and has totted up an extensive list of appearances since his Harry Potter days. These include: 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Dark Knight Rises' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'.  He also voiced Viktor Reznov and Daniel Clarke in the 'Call of Duty' games.
David also lent his voice to video games, specifically as the voice of Lord Darius Crowley in 'World of Warcraft: Cataclysm in 2010'.  Other projects include 'War Horse' and a role in 'Separate We Come, Separate We Go', a short film directed by Bonnie Wright, who played Ginny Weasley.
Do we really need to tell you what John Cleese has been up to? Seriously?
Mad-eye Moody is actually quite sharp, bagging himself parts in numerous projects including 2014's 'Edge of Tomorrow'.  He's also set to star in 'Suffragette', alongside Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham-Carter.
Geraldine's fleeting appearances as Harry's mum gave the movies some of their most poignant moments.   Since then, she's appeared in 'My Week With Marilyn' and 'Grace Of Monaco'.
Natalia evidently knows how to smell out a hit as she's also starred in 'Game of Thrones' as Osha.
David's done barely anything since his time as Barty Crouch Jr.   No time as a famous Timelord, no treading the boards in Shakespeare plays and he definitely didn't star opposite Olivia Colman in an award-winning ITV drama series. Lazy moo.
A bit of a cult hit on YouTube, Warwick Davies has been feautured on several channels, most notably the YogsCast.   In the land of television he's made guest appearances on shows including 'An Idiot Abroad', 'Top Gear'. He also played Oberon the Ufgood in 'Dwarves Assemble'.  More recently he played Old Hamm in 'Jack the Giant Slayer' and can (sometimes) be found teaching charms lessons at the Warner Bros. Studios VIP nights.
Like Ralph Fiennes, Helen also appeared in 'Skyfall'. she also stars in the hit drama 'Peaky Blinders' as Aunt Polly.
What can we say? The inimitable Helena Bonham Carter played the role of Bellatrix to disturbing perfection and played similarly creepy parts in many other movies. To be honest, if Voldy had left her in charge, he probably would have triumphed.  Helena was the perfect Madame Thernardier in 'Les Miserables' and also gave a stellar performance as Elizabeth Taylor in a BBC television film.
Shirley Henderson appeared in just a couple of the movies as the ghoul skulking around the toilets.   Since then, she voiced the Gruffalo's child in the film of the same name and also starred in 'Soutchliffe', 'Filth' and 'Death In Paradise'.
Since 'Harry Potter' Staunton has voiced Queen Victoria in 'The Pirates! Band of Misfits' and played Knotgrass in 'Maleficent'.

Only one quarter of the 1.1 million people with HIV have their condition under control, where "under control" means the virus has been suppressed, according to a report released this summer by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   CORRECTION: The first sentence has been reworded to more accurately reflect the number of people with HIV.
Even though two men were, for a time, able to go off antiretrovirals because their HIV had been reduced to undetectable levels after receiving bone marrow transplants, the HIV eventually returned in the men, according to news reports.  In 2012, the news of the mens undetectable HIV levels made headlines. The men, who were both HIV positive and taking antiretroviral drugs, had received bone marrow transplants for Hodgkins lymphoma. They had received the transplants while they were also taking the antiretroviral medication.   However, in late 2013, preliminary results showed that the HIV had returned.   This slide has been updated to note more recent developments related to the procedure.
New HIV infection rates can be dramatically lowered by making antiretroviral drugs free, a study from Canadian researchers found.   The Canadian Press reported on the study, conducted by B.C. Centre for Excellence in HIV-AIDS researchers, which showed that British Columbia -- a province that offers free access to antiretroviral therapy  -- had the lowest rate of new HIV infections over a more-than-10-year period, compared with Ontairio and Quebec.
More than half of HIV-infected young people are unaware that they have the virus, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.  "Given everything we know about HIV and how to prevent it in 30 years of fighting the disease, it's just unacceptable that young people are becoming infected at such high rates," Reuters reported CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden saying.   The report also showed that for young people, 72 percent of the new HIV infections were in men who have sex with men, while almost 50 percent were in young, African-American males, Reuters reported. These figures are based on 2010 data.
The number of people living with HIV has increased by 18 percent from 2001 to 2011, according to a report released this year from the United Nations Programme on AIDS. An estimated 34.2 million people around the world are living with HIV.   The report also showed that deaths from AIDS have dropped, from 2.3 million in 2005-2006 to 1.7 million in 2011, Reuters reported.
According to the same United Nations report, costs for the cheapest UN-recommended antiretroviral therapy drugs have also decreased over the past 10 years, Reuters reported. A year's worth of the drugs used to cost $10,000 in 2000 for one person; now, it costs $100 a year.
The Food and Drug Administration this year officially approved the drug Truvada -- which has been used since 2004 as a treatment for HIV -- to be sold as a preventive measure for people who don't have the infection, but are at high risk for it.  The FDA said that the pill should be considered for preventive use not only by gay or bisexual men who are at high risk for HIV, but also heterosexual men and women who may also face HIV risks, the Associated Press reported.   Heterosexual men and women make up more than one-fourth of new cases of HIV, and "that's not a portion of the epidemic we want to ignore," the CDC's Dr. Dawn Smith, who was the lead author of the new recommendations, told the Associated Press.   The FDA also approved a new drug this year, Stribild, to treat HIV, Reuters reported.
In findings published this year in the journal PLoS Pathogens, scientists from the University of California, Los Angeles found that it's possible to genetically engineer stem cells to attack living HIV-infected cells in mice.   While the study was only for "proof-of-principle," it "lays the groundwork for the potential use of this type of an approach in combating HIV infection in infected individuals, in hopes of eradicating the virus from the body," study researcher Dr. Scott G. Kitchen, an assistant professor of medicine at UCLA, said in a statement.
People should be screened for HIV even if they're not at high risk of contracting the infection, according to draft recommendations released just last month by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The recommendations would mean that everyone between the ages of 15 and 65 should be screened for HIV, even if they're not at high risk for it, Reuters reported.   "The prior recommendations were for screening high-risk adults and adolescents," Dr. Douglas Owens, a member of the USPSTF task force and a Stanford University medical professor, told Reuters. "The current recommendation is for screening everyone, regardless of their risk."
All HIV patients should be treated immediately with antiretrovirals, according to new guidelines issued this year from a panel of the International Antiviral Society-USA, as reported by TIME. The recommendations are counter to previous guidelines, which said that antiretrovirals should only be used if the CD4 count -- a measure of immune cells in a person's body -- becomes less than 350 cells for every mm3 of blood.

SAINT-QUENTIN-FALLAVIER, France (AP)  An attacker with suspected ties to French Islamic radicals rammed a car into a gas factory Friday in southeastern France, and a severed head was staked on a post at the entrance, officials said. France immediately opened a terrorism investigation.
Two people were injured, authorities said.
President Francois Hollande, speaking in Brussels, said the attack began shortly before 10 a.m. when a car crashed through the gate of a gas factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, southeast of Lyon. The car then plowed into gas canisters, touching off an explosion, he said.
"No doubt about the intention  to cause an explosion," Hollande said, calling the attack "of a terrorist nature."
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a man who had been flagged in 2006 for suspected ties to extremists was seized by an alert firefighter, one of multiple people in custody after the attack. He said authorities were trying to identify the victim whose severed head was posted at the factory's entrance.
"People who could have participated in this abject crime are in custody," he said.

Cazeneuve said the suspect had been known to intelligence services, who had him under surveillance from 2006-08. The man is from the Lyon region, he said.
A severed head was found staked on a gate at the factory's entrance, in what appeared to be an echo of the Islamic State group's practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads for all to see. An official said two flags  one white and one black, both with Arabic inscriptions  were found nearby.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release details to the media, said the victim was not decapitated by the blast.
France's anti-terror prosecutor said an investigation was opened into the attack, and potential charges including plotting as part of "a terrorist group."
Hollande spoke after watching TV news reports about the attack with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as both leaders attended a European Union summit in Brussels.
The industrial site belongs to Air Products, an American chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The company would not confirm whether any employees were injured or killed.
"Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for," the company said in a statement. "The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities."

Cazeneuve said the investigation had just begun and cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
France went on high alert after attacks in January against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher grocery store and a policewoman that left 20 people dead in the Paris region, including three Islamic extremist attackers.
Since then, fears of copycat attacks have risen. One person was arrested after authorities said he was plotting to gun down churches in the Paris region. Cazeneuve said Friday that security has been heightened at religious sites around the country.

SAINT-QUENTIN-FALLAVIER, France (AP)  An attacker with suspected ties to French Islamic radicals rammed a car into a gas factory Friday in southeastern France, and a severed head was staked on a post at the entrance, officials said. France immediately opened a terrorism investigation.
Two people were injured, authorities said.
President Francois Hollande, speaking in Brussels, said the attack began shortly before 10 a.m. when a car crashed through the gate of a gas factory in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, southeast of Lyon. The car then plowed into gas canisters, touching off an explosion, he said.
"No doubt about the intention  to cause an explosion," Hollande said, calling the attack "of a terrorist nature."
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a man who had been flagged in 2006 for suspected ties to extremists was seized by an alert firefighter, one of multiple people in custody after the attack. He said authorities were trying to identify the victim whose severed head was posted at the factory's entrance.
"People who could have participated in this abject crime are in custody," he said.

Cazeneuve said the suspect had been known to intelligence services, who had him under surveillance from 2006-08. The man is from the Lyon region, he said.
A severed head was found staked on a gate at the factory's entrance, in what appeared to be an echo of the Islamic State group's practice of beheading prisoners and displaying their heads for all to see. An official said two flags  one white and one black, both with Arabic inscriptions  were found nearby.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release details to the media, said the victim was not decapitated by the blast.
France's anti-terror prosecutor said an investigation was opened into the attack, and potential charges including plotting as part of "a terrorist group."
Hollande spoke after watching TV news reports about the attack with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as both leaders attended a European Union summit in Brussels.
The industrial site belongs to Air Products, an American chemical company based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The company would not confirm whether any employees were injured or killed.
"Our priority at this stage is to take care of our employees, who have been evacuated from the site and all accounted for," the company said in a statement. "The site is secure. Our crisis and emergency response teams have been activated and are working closely with all relevant authorities."

Cazeneuve said the investigation had just begun and cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
France went on high alert after attacks in January against the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a kosher grocery store and a policewoman that left 20 people dead in the Paris region, including three Islamic extremist attackers.
Since then, fears of copycat attacks have risen. One person was arrested after authorities said he was plotting to gun down churches in the Paris region. Cazeneuve said Friday that security has been heightened at religious sites around the country.

        <title>Chinese-Filipino Community's Dilemma: The Philippines, China, and the South China Sea Disputes</title>

At its very core, the Philippines is an idea, representing a pluralistic land with hospitable people, who have always welcomed persecuted people from around the world. It is an all-embracing society that has been open to peoples from around the world.
Nationalism and nationhood in post-colonial, cosmopolitan countries like the Philippines aren't about ethnicity, but, as eminent Sociologist Benedict Anderson suggest, they are instead anchored by an "imagined community" that is bound by shared dreams, sufferings, and experiences. Amid rising tensions in the South China Sea, pitting a powerful China against a beleaguered Philippines, the sizable and well-integrated Chinese community in the Philippines is feeling the heat.
Recently, one of the Philippines' most celebrated writers elicited highly negative reactions among certain circles, particularly the Filipino-Chinese community, by implicitly questioning their loyalty to the Philippines, specifically in an event of war with China. The last thing the Philippines needs at this point is divisive talk and internal divisions. The Filipino-Chinese community serves as a backbone of the country's economy, with many among them rising to positions of great prominence -- whether in business or politics or entertainment -- in the Southeast Asian nation.
Critical Junctures
In their best-selling book, Why Nations Fail , economists James A. Robinson and Daron Acemolu discuss the double-edged nature of what they call critical junctures: Seismic events, which shake up the foundations of the status quo. Sometimes, crises create the right kind of exogenous pressure to disrupt a dysfunctional equilibrium, forcing positive change and encouraging innovative adaptation by troubled societies.
In other cases, crises lead to further divisions and, ultimately, the collapse of an entire civilization. In Collaps e, Evolutionary Biologist Jared Diamond dramatically chronicles the extinction of certain civilizations due to their inability to adapt to changes in their environment.
Yes, we are in the 21st century, but the Darwinian nature of international politics has not dramatically changed in recent times, as exemplified by Russia's unabashed annexation of Crimea and China's sweeping territorial push across the Western Pacific. As much as we would want our world to be strictly governed by international law, power politics, however, continues to shape our globalized world (See John Mearsheimer's Tragedy of Great Power Politics ), with more powerful countries still pressing ahead with their interests even under immense international pressure.
Despite widespread international outcry, China has effectively concluded its construction activities on disputed features in the Spratly chain of islands, creating a sprawling network of civilian and military installations at the heart of one of the world's most important waterways. If and when China chooses to impose an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) in the area, it would be in a position to push its neighbors out of features under their control.
In some ways, the ongoing disputes with China in the South China Sea represent a critical juncture, testing the competence of Philippine state institutions and the patriotism of its citizenry. The festering territorial spats should serve as a wake up call, instilling into the fabric of Filipino society a robust sense of national unity like never before.
Chinese Threat in Perspective
To begin with, the prospect of a full-scale Chinese invasion of its neighboring countries is highly unlikely. Such paranoid language is more of an outcome of sensationalist commentaries by warmongering journalists and self-serving defense wonks than sober assessment of realities on the ground. Without a question, China is rapidly developing an anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capability , which down the road may give it the ability to dominate adjacent waters and push the United States out of East Asia.
But what China is seeking is a "zone of deference" rather than European-style colonization of its neighbors. China is developing the kind of military technology and economic hegemony, which will allow it to win strategic battles without waging full-scale war. As prominent Chinese scholar Yan Xuetong b luntly puts it : "The policy now is to allow these smaller [neighboring] countries to benefit economically from their relationships with China. For China, we need good relationships more urgently than we need economic development. We let them benefit economically, and in return we get good political relationships. We should 'purchase' the relationships."
This is one of the reasons behind China's massive investment in the infrastructure of neighboring countries, a phenomenon that will be buttressed by the establishment of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Maritime Silk Road Initiative in Southeast Asia. China channels its ambitions through calibrated assertiveness -- just look at China's salami-slicing strategy in the South China Sea -- rather than mindless expansionism. Of course, there is a risk that things will get out of hand as China expands its presence in contested waters -- marking a gradual sleep walk into confrontation, similar to what happened prior to World War I.
As for China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), it is more interested in and preparing for winning limited wars -- small skirmishes with chilling strategic effect -- than waging an invasion of a neighboring country. China's military strategy is driven by the doctrine of "active defense". Not to mention, the PLA, which still relies on some Soviet-era technology, is yet to be fully-modernized, putting into question its ability to effectively project power beyond its immediate shores.
On National Unity
One of the things the Philippines should be proud about is how it has never, at least in modern times, experienced the kind of inter-ethnic strife -- particularly against minority Chinese communities -- that have afflicted other Southeast Asian countries in the 20th century. Compared to some of its counterparts in Southeast Asia, the Chinese community in the Philippines is highly integrated and doesn't suffer from systematic exclusion.
Over generations, the Filipino-Chinese community has evolved into an authentic, integral component of the Filipino society. Filipino-Chinese businessmen consistently rank among the wealthiest in the country, overseeing large conglomerates, which have been the drivers of growth in recent years. Obviously, given their expanding business interests in China, many Filipino-Chinese tycoons have tried to foster a semblance of stability in Philippine-China relations, often supporting diplomatic efforts to diffuse territorial tensions.
There is a reason why the Chinese diaspora in the Philippines has managed to so easily integrate: Being Filipino is not necessarily defined by ethnicity, but rather by shared values -- opposition to dictatorship, instinctive embrace of liberalism, and celebration of multiculturalism. The Philippines' own very founding fathers -- no less than Jose Rizal, who has a monument in his ancestral home in Qiongque Village, Luoshan Town in Jinjiang City -- were from (Filipino-Chinese) Mestizo stock. The Philippines' incumbent president, and his late mother who was also a president, has Chinese lineage.
In his deeply moving column for the Philippine Daily Inquirer, legal scholar Oscar Franklin Tan points out how the mindset of the Filipino-Chinese community, especially liberal-minded members like him, and the Beijing government are "worlds apart". He laments how he "cannot celebrate [Philippine] independence when I can be so casually told in public that I am less of a Filipino or a person solely because my grandparents were immigrants".
Given the gravity of challenges faced by the Philippines, it is the perfect moment for national unity, building on the vast talents of the Filipino people of all ethnicities. And it is also time for the Philippines to stand on its own, developing its own capabilities to deter aggression and revanchism.

        <MainBody>Islamic State Attack In Northeast Syria Displaces 60,000, UN Reports
Reuters
reddit
(Adds details from U.N. report)
BEIRUT, June 26 (Reuters) - An Islamic State attack on the  northeastern Syrian city of Hasaka is reported to have displaced  60,000 people, the United Nations office in Syria said on  Friday, warning that up to 200,000 people may eventually try to  flee.
Islamic State launched an assault on government-held areas  of Hasaka on Thursday, capturing at least one district in the  southwest of the city, which lies close to the borders with  Turkey and Iraq.
Hasaka is divided into zones run separately by the  government of President Bashar al-Assad and a Kurdish  administration. Islamic State fighters also attacked the  Kurdish-held town of Kobani, or Ayn al-Arab, in its twin  offensive on Thursday.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within Hasaka  city while 10,000 had left northwards towards Amuda town, close  to the Turkish border.
Its report on developments on Thursday cited the Syrian  government's Department of Social Affairs and local partners. It  said the estimated pre-war population in Hasaka was around  300,000 people.
"An estimated 200,000 people may try to flee the city in the  coming hours to northern areas of the governorate, most likely  towards Amuda and Qamishli," it said. Qamishli is a city around  80km (50 miles) north of Hasaka that sits on the Turkish border.
Islamic State said on Thursday it had seized al-Nashwa  district and neighboring areas in the southwest of Hasaka, a  city divided into zones of government and Kurdish control.
It said humanitarian partners in Qamishli and the Department  of Social affairs met on Thursday in preparation for an expected  influx of displaced people.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based  organization that tracks the war, said clashes in Kobani erupted  between Islamic State militants and the Kurdish YPG militia for  a second day on Friday.       (Reporting by Sylvia Westall; Editing by Dominic Evans)

The big-screen debut of Macca features Paul and his three bandmates (and his "grandfather") running around London, being chased by hordes of fans, as they attempt to film a performance for a television show. The movie was a parody on the Beatles staggering popularity.
The second comedy flick from the Fab Four follows the Beatles as they attempt to rescue Ringo from a cult who've chosen him as a sacrificial victim.
The last live performance by the Beatles (and arguably the greatest concert in music history), was recorded for the documentary, "Let It Be." Despite the band bickering and fighting on screen, the four still manage to pull off an entertaining, unannounced show on the top of the Apple records building in London, stopping traffic on the street below and prompting a shutdown by local police.
The film, named after the Beatles 1967 album, featured the Bee Gees' Barry, Robin and Maurice Gibb, along with Peter Frampton (Billy Shears), as the reformed Sgt. Pepper's band. The movie included covers of Beatles songs by other bands and celebrities (including this wacky version of "Maxwell's Silver Hammer" by comedian Steve Martin.)
The 1974 James Bond movie starring Roger Moore featured a theme song composed by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Macca's band Wings. The track is still one of the most popular themes in the 007 canon.
Similar to "A Hard Day's Night," this day-in-the-life musical starred Paul and Linda McCartney and Ringo Starr, as themselves. The plot revolves around Paul attempting to locate the masters to his new album, which have been stolen by an employee.
Wes Anderson's movies are no stranger to classic rock-heavy soundtracks. In his 2001 film, "The Royal Tenenbaums," Wes had the Mutato Muzika Orchestra cover the Beatles' "Hey Jude," (a song credited to Lennon-McCartney, but mainly written by Sir Paul, himself).
Though McCartney and the Beatles did not provide voice work to the characters (well, other than the songs), the film was eventually endorsed by the group, after having reservations due to the negative reception of their last project, the TV special "Magical Mystery Tour." Here, the song "All Together Now," written primarily by McCartney, plays to great effect as the crew begins turning the ship on.
Speaking of the "Magical Mystery Tour" movie, which debuted on BBC1 in 1967, it ended up being a critical disaster for the band. But, oh well, at least it gave us McCartney singing "A Fool on the Hill"...on a hill!
Though it got mixed reviews from critics, "Across the Universe" still attempts to pay tribute to the Beatles in a new and unique way. Julie Taymor's visually stunning musical is just one of the dozens of movies to reimagine the Beatles music. This scene features the McCartney-penned "I've Just Seen a Face," covered by actor Jim Sturgess

        <title>The UN Charter at 70: Toward a Safer and Sustainable Future for We the Peoples</title>

Long before I became Secretary-General, the United Nations occupied a special place in my life.  I was six years old when the Korean War broke out.  I have memories of my village in flames as my family sought refuge in nearby mountains.  But another sight is even more lasting: the UN flag.  We were saved from hunger by UN food relief operations; we received textbooks from UNESCO; and when we wondered whether the outside world cared about our suffering, the troops of many nations sacrificed their lives to restore security and peace.
I know from my childhood, and now from decades of public service, the immense difference the United Nations can make.  As we mark the anniversary of the adoption of the Organization's founding Charter on June 26, 1945 in San Francisco, my hope is that the human family will come together with greater determination to work for a safer and more sustainable future for "we, the peoples," in whose name the Charter was drafted.
The United Nations at 70 can look back on a proud record of working with many partners to dismantle colonialism, triumph over apartheid, keep the peace in troubled places and articulate a body of treaties and law to safeguard human rights.  Every day, the United Nations feeds the hungry, shelters refugees and vaccinates children against polio and other deadly diseases.  Our relief workers brave remote and dangerous environments to deliver humanitarian assistance, and our mediators strive to find common ground between warring parties and peaceful solutions to grievances and disputes.  The United Nations was founded to prevent another world war, and it has succeeded in that core mission; despite grave setbacks, the past seven decades would surely have been even bloodier without the United Nations.
Yet we are keenly aware that today's landscape is scarred by conflict, exploitation and despair.  At least 59.5 million people have fled their homes - more refugees, displaced persons and asylum-seekers than at any time since the end of the Second World War.  Violence against women blights all societies. At a time of pressing human needs, huge   amounts of money continue to be squandered on nuclear weapons and other destabilizing military arsenals. The consequences of climate change are ever more apparent - and have only just begun. And although the world said "never again" after the Holocaust, and again after genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica, we continue to witness atrocious crimes by violent extremists and others.
New powers have emerged since the representatives of 50 nations gathered to draft the Charter, and membership in the Organization has grown to 193.  Globalization, urbanization, migration, demographic shifts, technological advances and other seismic developments continue to remake our societies and transform international relations.  Yet the Charter's vision of a world of peace, and the values enshrined in the text - dignity, equal rights, tolerance and freedom - remain touchstones for people everywhere.
The 70th anniversary falls in a year of potentially momentous decisions on our common future.  Countries are shaping what we hope will be an inspiring new sustainable development agenda and moving towards a meaningful agreement on climate change.  Our goal is transformation: we are the first generation that can erase poverty from the earth - and the last that can act to avoid the worst impacts of a warming world.
As the distinctions between the national and the international continue to fall away, challenges faced by one become challenges faced by all, sometimes gradually but often suddenly. With our fates ever more entwined, our future must be one of ever deeper cooperation - nations united by a spirit of global citizenship that lives up to the promise of the Organization's name.

As part of the brainstorming sessions in US intellectual and political circles, much is being said about how the United States could coexist with the Islamic Republic of Iran when it is radically empowered under a final nuclear deal and an upgraded bilateral relationship like the one being sought by the Obama administration. One of the clear consequences of Obama's insistence on a deal with Tehran is perpetuating unprecedented division in the United States: One faction focuses on appeasement of Iran considering that there is no alternative to a nuclear deal, even if it is full of loopholes, and that American-Iranian rapprochement will co-opt the mullahs of Iran, embolden moderates, rein in hardliners, and undermine Iran's regional expansion plans. The other faction sees that the nuclear agreement will not curb the nuclear ambitions of the Iranian theocracy, and that at best, it would delay an Iranian nuclear bomb by a decade. This faction also believes that lifting the sanctions on Iran would practically allow it to execute its nuclear plans, which would launch a nuclear arms race in the Gulf and invalidate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This factions sees that the primary beneficiary of such an outcome would not be the moderate forces but the Revolutionary Guards, they key sponsor of Iran's regional expansion from Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon to Yemen, establishing militias that undermine the states in these countries--mirroring the Islamic State group (ISIS) whose doctrine is the destruction of nation states in the Arab region to establish its caliphate.
The first faction embraces the US pivot away from traditional allies, including in the Arab region, and closer to Iran. It sees this as a wise policy, based on its interpretation of 9/11 which blames Arab actors for the terrorist attacks.
The second faction stresses that it was Iran and its allies that killed the largest number of Americans, and not the Arab countries or even al-Qaeda and ISIS. For this reason, senior members of the second faction want to redesign US policy in the Middle East post-Obama, and they have ideas worth pausing at as part of the necessary brainstorming that the Arab region must take part in.
Under the title "The realignment of the Arab region in the international arena: Beyond politics, economics, and security threats", an Arab-regional-international workshop will be held in October to discuss the options available and come up with recommendations on how to overcome various challenges. The Beirut Institute, an Arab think-tank founded by the author of this article, will convene the Beirut Institute Summit in Abu Dhabi as an opportunity to come up with positive and practical ideas.
Some of the participants have already started submitting proposals, including figures closely involved in long-term US policymaking. The autumn scheduling is meant to coincide with the start of the US presidential election campaigns. The idea is that the Arab region must start thinking seriously about the future, instead of remaining fixated on what Barack Obama is doing.
By this autumn, the Arab region in all likelihood will have to start accepting the new reality of the American-Iranian relationship built by Barack Obama.  And regardless of who the next president will be, be it a Democrat or a Republican, US policy in the Middle East will be shaped by the ties with Iran and the putative nuclear deal and its implementation.
The American strategist who was involved in decision-making for decades believes rebuilding the US Middle East policy post-Obama is not difficult, and says this will depend on three things the new US president will have to do:
First, reestablishing the alliance with Egypt, not just verbally, but also by doubling US military aid to $3 billion a year and inviting President Sisi to the White House, to reaffirm the Camp David accords and restore defensive ties. This alone, he says, can reassure Egypt and stop it from seeking alternative partners including Russia. This, he argues, cannot be achieved as long as there are American restrictions on Egypt. Egypt is crucial in the war on ISIS, especially in Libya, and is a key partner in broader US-Arab relations, especially in the light of the firm strategic alliance among Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
Second, Libya needs an intervention similar to the NATO-led intervention in the past, in support of the legitimate government in Tobruk. Hesitation and complacency will allow ISIS and similar extremist groups in Libya to grow and threaten other North African nations. The positions of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt must get real support from Washington, and there is no option but to defeat the Tripoli-based government and ISIS in Libya. This requires supporting Khalifa Haftar's forces, which are fighting both al-Qaeda and ISIS.
Third, always according to the US strategist, political and military decisions concerning Kurdistan should be made: Sending military aid directly to Erbil and not via Baghdad, and declaring that the United States does not mind for Kurdistan to export oil and even welcome Kurdish oil in US energy markets, as this would help Kurdistan fund its war with ISIS.
These are the views of veteran US policymaker, meant to prevent the deterioration of US influence in the Middle East. Some may agree with them, others may not, but they are strategic ideas and not just a diagnosis followed by surrender. And this is exactly what's needed: Pragmatic ideas to take US policy into a new approach following recent shifts in its policy.
Some may protest the idea of allowing the Kurds to secede from Iraq, which is implicit in the qualitative shift in US-Kurdish relations. In fact, the moderates are in Sulaymaniyah as they are in Amman, and a million Kurds have been displaced. There is a need for the Arab countries, led by Saudi Arabia, to reassess. Kurds in the Arab region as part of the Arab fabric just like Shiite Arabs are. It is time for a new and radically different relationship with both components, and it is crucial to correct the impression that only Sunni Arabs are Arabs as in the Saudi perception. Kurds and Shiites in the Arab countries are an essential part of the multiethnic, multiconfessional mosaic, and the Arab interest requires addressing this problem.
The Arab interest also requires practical ideas in light of the nuclear deal and the upgrading of the American-Iranian bilateral relationship. There is a dire need for a change in strategy from Yemen to Lebanon.
In Yemen, there is no alternative to choosing between an exit strategy, one that would secure the Saudi-Yemeni border, and escalating militarily to secure Aden, Hodeidah, and Taiz, with measures in Sanaa. The options boil down to securing the cities and gradually clawing back territory, or withdrawing from Yemen in an organized international framework supported by a Marshall plan to rescue Yemen economically and humanitarianly. The aerial bombardment campaigns will not achieve anything more, and it would be best to reduce air strikes and focus them as part of a new strategy.
In Syria, the Kurds do have a place in a new military strategy based on bringing the Kurdish forces together with moderate rebel forces. This, in turn, would require a shift in how Syria is dealt with. The Gulf countries need to think profoundly about the subject, especially in light of the possible lifting of the sanctions on Iran.
Economists speak of a golden age in Iran if the sanctions are lifted under a nuclear deal. They say Iran's oil exports could increase from 1 million barrels per day to 2 million barrels, worth $75 million a day or $2.2 billion a month. This would be enough cash for the Revolutionary Guard to finance its plans. The Revolutionary Guard already used Iraq's budget to finance its war in Syria in the past, when former Iraqi PM Nuri al-Maliki made the Iraqi treasury the equivalent to an ATM to finance the adventures of the Revolutionary Guard in Syria.
After the sanctions are lifted, Tehran will be able to pump money not only into its war in Syria, but also into Hezbollah in Lebanon, which in turn will radically alter the path and fate of Lebanon. Since Lebanon is in a state of complete vacuum, Hezbollah would be able to impose its demands there.
ISIS is being used as a pretext in Lebanon, since Hezbollah and ISIS are fighting in Syria. But if the Arab strategy wants to be wise, it must give Lebanon due attention before it is too late. Because while ISIS wants Damascus and Baghdad, and not Beirut, it could be lured into Lebanon. Losing Lebanon to Hezbollah or ISIS would be a major loss for Arab strategy and for the United States, whether under Obama or a new occupant of the White House.
The Obama administration does not want to pay attention to such "trivial" issues standing in its way towards a legacy represented by a deal with Iran. The administration is in a willful coma, it seems.
However, the United States is not bound by its administration. True, major US policies are developed in their broad outlines for the long term on a strategic basis, and various administrations implement them with some changes here or amendments there. However, policies are not detached from reality, and all this shapes decision-making. For this reason, it is possible to see institutions operating for years and decades to shape decision making.
Think-tanks and workshops are part of the dynamic of influencing strategic decision-making, which is what the Arab region needs.
The picture appears bleak in the context of the nuclear deal with Tehran. Ali Khamenei has dictated seven near-impossible conditions he dubbed "red lines". These could be part of the art of negotiations but they could lead to detonating the entire nuclear talks.
Logically, there is no room today for an agreement. Khamenei made it clear that Tehran insists on having the US and international sanctions lifted as soon as a deal is concluded, before Iran dismantles any nuclear capabilities. He said nuclear research would not be frozen and military sites would be off-limits. As for the issue of reimposing sanctions in the event Tehran fails to abide by its commitments, Russia and China will be there to guarantee any such bid would be vetoed.
But politically, it seems illogical that we have reached this point in the negotiations only for them to fail. Ultimately, it is more important to develop strategies in preparation for any outcome. Once again, an Arab collective brainstorming is crucial and urgent.

        <MainBody>As Debt Deal Looms, Greeks Dream Big

As Greek leaders work around the clock to negotiate a new bailout deal with their creditors, ordinary Greeks remain anxious about what lies ahead.
The Huffington Post spoke to two Greek citizens with very different political views and very different hopes and expectations about a forthcoming deal. While both are deeply concerned about the outcome of the deal, they have dreams for a brighter future for Greece that go far beyond the events of the coming weeks.
Parina Stiakaki, 66, is a translator living in Athens. Stiakaki used to translate Greek business and stock market materials into English, but in the past few years, all of her work has dried up. Her only source of income now is the residential properties that she owns. Because many of her renters can no longer pay their rent, and she refuses to throw them out, Stiakaki still operates at a loss. She estimates that she has to withdraw 5,000 euros a year from her life savings in order to pay her bills. Despite her negative income, Stiakaki says she's still paying income taxes, because the government now counts the value of her house and car as income.
Stiakaki has applied for her state pension, but she's not expecting to receive it anytime soon. If I get one at all, it wont be for another year and a half, she said. There is currently a backlog of 400,000 pension applications, according to Greek government estimates .
Still, Stiakaki considers herself lucky. She has two grown sons who support themselves and their families without her help. And she knows many people who have not been so fortunate.
I have friends who cannot pay their taxes anymore and are worried about having their houses repossessed, she said. People are skimping on food, even.
There used to be a 70-year-old man living down the road from Stiakaki. He was a civil engineer, she remembers. He shot and killed himself as the recession was beginning. Stiakaki believes that the man had debts he couldn't pay, and that the suicide was at least partly a response to his economic distress.
Stiakaki voted for Greece's Syriza party in January because she wanted relief from economic austerity.
Now she says that any deal that asks Greeks to endure even higher taxes and smaller government benefits must include debt relief as well -- or it is not worth taking at all. She would prefer a "Grexit," or Greek exit from the euro, to a deal that puts the country in such a position.
It is inevitable that after six months or a year, Greece will leave the euro, she said. This is a useless exercise. It will mean more pain and suffering and no problem will be fixed.
Polling shows that Stiakakis support for a Grexit puts her in the minority among Greeks -- and even among Syriza supporters. But Stiakaki, who has a bachelors degree in economics from the London School of Economics and who maintains a blog on Greek politics , believes that restoring Greeces control of its currency is the best of many bad options.
The choice is between a slow, lingering death, Stiakaki said, referring to additional budget tightening, and a jolt that will be hard and bring a change in the economic outlook.
In my personal opinion, it would be very tough for a few months and maybe a year, she explained. But after that, the economy would get growing. We would go back to the drachma and devalue our currency.
This isn't the prevailing view among economists, although some -- including the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman -- share the same outlook as Stiakaki, arguing that a cheaper currency could allow Greece to recover economically.
And Stiakaki is ready to vote against Syriza to make a Grexit happen.
If Syriza would run as the party it is today, then I would still vote for them, she said. If it splits, I would side with the party in favor of leaving the euro.
As HuffPost has reported , the scenario Stiakaki describes -- in which a deal freighted with concessions prompts Syrizas more radical factions to revolt against Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras -- is not unlikely.
Like Stiakaki, Yannis Koutsomitis, 50, a television and film producer living in Crete, saw his livelihood destroyed by the 2008 financial crisis and the prolonged recession since then. Koutsomitis had enjoyed success and recognition for his production of TV primetime dramas. In 2008, he won the Greek equivalent of an Emmy for producer of the year for his work on the popular Greek series " Matomena Homata ."
Koutsomitis award-winning work was also his last in the industry to date.
The TV sector has suffered a devastating crisis, Koutsomitis said. There is almost no primetime drama produced in Greece anymore.
Koutsomitis' partner is a lawyer, and when Koutsomitis stopped getting work after the economic downturn, the two of them were able to rely on her income for a while. In 2010, Koutsomitis started blogging about post-crisis Greek politics and economics, and he now earns some money as a political analyst for Germanys NTV and BBC Radio. Koutsomitis and his partner support a son from one of the partners previous relationships. Koutsomitis parents are financially independent, living off combined pension benefits of 1,500 euros a month.
Koutsomitis and Stiakaki are both educated professionals whose careers were disrupted by Greeces economic turmoil. But they've drawn very different conclusions from the crisis.
A centrist on the Greek political spectrum, Koutsomitis is angry with Syriza for spending five months negotiating with Greeces creditors only to run out the clock in the final weeks over differences on pensions and a value-added tax increase that were known to be the main sticking points all along.
Koutsomitis does not share Stiakaki's hostility toward the countrys European creditors. Actually, he's of the view that they saved the Greek economy after its banks teetered on the brink of collapse, and he doesn't wholly blame the country's persistent economic malaise on the budget tightening the creditors have imposed. In fact, Koutsomitis thinks that structural problems like clientelism and a culture of social immobility will prevent unemployment from falling below 15 percent even after private sector demand recovers.
As a result, Koutsomitis believes the reforms demanded by creditors provide an opportunity to make Greece more economically competitive. He said he'd like to see a deal that institutes very thorough reform of the pension system. He'd also like to see defense cuts and other government spending cuts in exchange for debt relief.
The Greek government, as led by Syriza, has put up greater resistance to the idea of pension cuts than to any of the creditors other demands. Tsipras has claimed that additional cuts to the already reduced benefits will "only cause a further worsening of the already dramatic social situation." Tsipras and others point to the pension systems role as an all-purpose, multigenerational safety net at a time of high unemployment.
But Koutsomitis argues that current proposals would shield the poorest pensioners by guaranteeing a minimum pension.
And despite some measures limiting early retirement, he says that the pension system is still overly generous toward people who do not need the help.
The problem is that there are many, many people on pensions of 1,000 euros or more in their 50s, he said -- the implication being that people of that age ought to be working or at least looking for work.
As for taxes, Koutsomitis said he does not mind raising rates on wealthy individuals. But he objects to Syrizas proposed corporate tax hike, which he said could cause struggling Greek companies to collapse or move overseas.
Still, unlike Stiakaki, Koutsomitis considers leaving the euro a nonstarter. To his mind, a deal that lacks any of the components he prefers would still be better than no deal and a Grexit.
Nonetheless, Koutsomitis shares Stiakakis dream of a Greece that one day has more control over its destiny.
He hopes that five years from now, the country will have recovered enough economically to begin having a conversation about what kind of society it wants to be.
Some people want socialism and some want free-market economy, he said. Currently, he argues, Greece has neither model, but instead has a very odd mixture of clientelism and a state-run economy.
It has to be an open debate in the society, he said.

        <title>Julian Assange: Mainstream Media Rife With Censorship</title>
        <Link>http://feeds.huffingtonpost.com/c/35496/f/677102/s/47950868/sc/28/l/0L0Shuffingtonpost0N0Cseungyoon0Elee0Cjulian0Eassange0Emedia0Ecensorship0Ib0I76666540Bhtml0Dutm0Ihp0Iref0Fworld0Gir0FWorldPost/story01.htm</Link>

        <MainBody>reddit
Seung-yoon Lee, CEO and co-founder of Byline, recently conducted a rare exclusive three-hour interview with Julian Assange in Embassy of Ecuador, London. The interview has been serialized into three parts.
In part two of the series, Assange reflects on media -- how it works, whether there is hope in new media models and citizen journalism and whether he prefers Rupert Murdoch or Eric Schmidt. Read the original interview here . Read part one here .
Seung-Yoon Lee (SY): You have worked with the mainstream media throughout the world in releasing documents. How did your experience of cooperating with mainstream media influence your perspective on them? In retrospect, if you could go back, would you still choose to work with them?
Julian Assange (JA): We have contracts with more than a hundred media organizations around the world, still. But it varies among mainstream press outlets. For example, the one in Pakistan can be great on issues outside of Pakistan. Issues inside Pakistan are different. It's the same for Russia Today, outside Russia and Ukraine, it can be great, but inside Russia is a different story and through this we need to understand the political and economic dynamics that mean the organization might be trustworthy on one matter and not trustworthy on another matter.
"In my experience the best journalists are those that predominantly work for one news institution but also have one foot in others, or one foot in academia."
If we look at the big players in the Western press, such as the international New York Times or the BBC, they are all highly compromised organizations in terms of geopolitics, and in terms of their relationships with their own countries. It would be nice to live in a world where people didn't have to deal with an organization that is not compromised in any manner whatsoever, but we don't live in that world. People have to use cars and they have put to petrol in their cars, and that petrol is made by Shell or BP.
In order to get things done it is necessary, unfortunately -- or perhaps even fortunately -- to make compromises. But as long as you understand that you're making a compromise, and as long as you understand the whole trade-off and exactly what that trade-off is and that you are balancing a number of different players with each other, you are not becoming dependent. And that's a good rule not just for media startups, but also for journalists themselves. In my experience the best journalists are those that predominantly work for one news institution but also have one foot in others, or one foot in academia. They have a sense that they have another outlet, and that tends to keep their "home" newspaper honest as well.
For example, look at the James Risen case. James Risen was a New York Times reporter who had information about NSA air surveillance back in 2003. The NYT sat on that for 18 months, intentionally, across the U.S. election. Risen informed the NYT that he was going to publish this book containing that information , and as a result the NYT then published his story.
SY: How much self-censorship and/or censorship goes on in the mainstream media?
JA: It's almost all censorship. The majority of censorship is selectivity, so it is the decision to do one story and not another, to interview one person and not another. That's the way that the bulk of censorship occurs, and those decisions are made as a result of personal or shared experience. And what happens if you don't tow the party line? People are compromised, and their employment opportunities or social opportunities...
It's obvious if you think about it. Let's take a society like the United Kingdom -- about 70 million people. A study was done on news stories in the U.K., where the majority are generated by newspapers and picked up by TV networks. There are around 70 news stories each day in the U.K., on different subjects. That's one news story per million people in the U.K., per day. But just consider your own family or your own business, and how many interesting rumors or stories you pick up in your own life. The idea that there is only one interesting story per million people is absurd.
Take a country like Iceland, with a population of 300,000. That would suggest that the Icelandic press should only publish one story every three days. So that whittling down from where things would be if the U.K. was proportionate to Iceland -- throwing out all those stories that would naturally be there -- that is done by selectivity, which is performed according to political and psychological biases, and the fears of the journalists and editors concerned.
Here's a hard example. In the U.K. they have something called the Defence Advisory Board [ The Defence, Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee ]. It has monthly meetings with the editors of the newspapers, and they have agreements about what should and shouldn't be published.
"It would be nice to live in a world where people didn't have to deal with an organization that is not compromised in any manner whatsoever, but we don't live in that world."
SY: Our previous interviewee Noam Chomsky argued in "Manufacturing Consent" that the primary role of the mass media is to mobilize public support for the elite interests. I asked him if anything has changed since then to the media landscape. He said , "as far as we can see, the basic analysis we made is essentially unchanged," despite the mainstream perception that the Internet has given rise to citizen journalism and undermined the power of the traditional "manufacturers of consent". Obviously, WikiLeaks has done a lot on this front, but do you think Chomsky's view is relevant today?
JA: It's still true in so far as how Chomsky was talking about the relationship between successful large organizations and domestic populations. It is no longer true in all respects. National media or established media organizations principally based in one territory are now able to project their view of the world onto other territories. There are examples like Russia Today or CCTV. And many national newspapers that have a large following outside their own territory are gearing their content to maximize the power of national elites. They espouse positions that undermine the power of national elites in other countries. That's an important development for the mainstream press --internationalization of readership.
SY: You're talking about Al Jazeera, CCTV, Russia Today and so on?
JA: They are the big ones in terms of impact, but national newspapers which are geared toward domestic populations are nonetheless still often read internationally now. So while their content is not pushed on other populations through marketing, nonetheless people are able to read them through Internet recommendations. I've seen that phenomenon producing important results. For example, WikiLeaks has an international readership in English. The other way things have changed is -- and I don't mean social media per se here -- the increasing ability for individuals to communicate with each other outside their own regions. Information has been obtained and published through small publications, and it has then spread en masse through individual communication networks -- and happened rapidly, before censorship could be applied.
SY: Ferguson was reported through Twitter before being picked up by the press. . .
JA: You had RT going down there. The combination of social media and individuals talking about what was happening. It was through these individual networks and social networks, and then RT whipped it up and acted as an amplifier, to the point where the mainstream press felt they had to get onto the issue. They got on the issue predominantly to demonize it, and then eventually to co-opt certain elements. So basically like "bankers are bad, but the rest of the system is okay."
But it's also a time of great vibrancy for new publications, and for middle size startups like Vice, for instance. Vice has many problems -- Rupert Murdoch has bought a 5 percent stake, and 15 percent has gone off to one of the cable companies -- but nonetheless it is basically an organization that is more hungry for growth than it is for careful control of its content, and that's something that we're seeing in several hundred different publications around the world. Now, those publications will eventually be consolidated and integrated. Conde Nast has already done that with the previous generation, including Wired magazine, Reddit, the New Yorker online, etc. They have pulled them together and created an increasingly conservative organization. So these consolidations will happen. They will happen reasonably quickly because the Internet encourages economies of scale.
But each time we have a new technical platform -- for example, mobile phones or a change of web standards -- it tends to be the case that a new entrant who is not constrained by existing operations grows much faster. The problem is that some of the large organizations realize this as well. So if you look at Google, Google is actually an organization with very little innovation. It depicts itself as an innovative organization; it did improve the algorithmic efficiency of search engines. It was not, by any means the first search engine.
Nearly all the innovations that people think are Google's have come from acquisitions. YouTube was acquired , Android was acquired . Most of what people perceive to be Google innovations are actually Google acquisitions. So if you have the largest player gobbling up the new entrants then we aren't going to see that vibrancy as previously seen. Now, traditionally perhaps we would see antitrust or anti-monopoly laws used to prevent those kinds of acquisitions. However, there is no international antitrust law, because we are dealing with multinational companies that operate at scale across the whole Internet. There is no effective antitrust method to stop monopolization.
"What matters is whether it is done well. Very often it is not done well. But then, the standards in the mainstream press are appallingly low."
SY: What is your perspective on "citizen journalism"?
JA: The phrase is overplayed. But I think we should separate it into what I call "bystander journalism" and freelance journalism. Bystander journalism is when you happen to be in a place at a certain time and you take a photo of an event and report what you saw. But you usually don't do that. And the information just happens to be valuable. Especially photos and videos, which are harder to fake and therefore don't need any more external credibility. In the case of freelance journalism a person makes it their occupation, or part time occupation, to become an expert in some particular area, or an expert journalist in reporting about the world. And they can sell their work to newspapers.
I don't think this matters much. What matters is whether it is done well. Very often it is not done well. But then, the standards in the mainstream press are appallingly low.
SY: There was a comment I saw in your i nterview with John Pilger that you disclosed some materials to citizen journalists first but they didn't do anything. Why did you not rely on the so-called "citizen journalists"? Why did you rely on the traditional fourth estate like the Guardian and the New York Times instead of the new media players like bloggers and non-mainstream media outlets like new media and informal media?
JA: Back in 2007 when WikiLeaks was just starting, I knew from my previous experience that we could get leaks -- a lot of them. We could get a quality of information that could eclipse the research capacity of the mainstream press, and anyway the mainstream press had biases. And so we threw our material open to all these citizen journalists and commenters.
The result was that generally, citizen journalists were completely useless, with some exceptions. The market has improved, to be fair, but I realized that you have to look at the economy of why people do things. Most "citizen journalists" are surviving on surplus labor. They have something else that subsidizes them, whether employment or a pension, or whatnot. And then they engage in this other activity. So you have to question why they do it. A lot of the reason seems to be the desire to build a name for themselves, or to demonstrate their political position to their peers. The easiest way of doing that is to see what's on the front page of the New York Times and, using more words, essentially say "I agree" or "I disagree." And because it's so cost effective in relation to the desired outcome, that's what is done. If you look at popular blog sites like Tumblr or Wordpress, or microblogs like Twitter, you actually see that the overwhelming majority of it is commentary on the mainstream press, and repeating and forwarding those stories from the mainstream press which people feel back up their position. They can position themselves amongst their peers by taking a position.
We published a fantastic document on the War on Iraq, a classified document from the U.S. Army Ground Intelligence Center on the assault against Fallujah in 2004 . Fallujah even at that time was viewed to be the worst example of the U.S. occupation of Iraq. It was an example of the clearest violation of the laws of war, and so it was a hot topic and here was proof of what had happened that day, written up by the U.S. military themselves. It was a document which I did not need to analyze, and that WikiLeaks staff did not need to analyze to great depth. It was easy to read, and it was on a controversial topic that a lot of people said they were interested in. So we thought we could put it out there and inevitably a lot of people would write about it, because many, many people were talking about Fallujah and saying how bad it was. The result was nothing. No one did a thing. It wasn't until we contacted some professors who were friends of ours, and a friend in one of the news wires, that it got a proper write-up and analysis. That's because it takes time and effort. And if you can position yourself amongst your peers without taking any time and effort, and that's what your goal is, then why would you bother?
"In some sense, it's not Rupert Murdoch that controls the distribution of news, but Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg."
SY: What do you think the potential of crowdfunding to democratize the media landscape? Most recently, investigative journalists like John Pilger have used the method to finance their reporting. By freeing journalists and media organizations from the influence of media moguls and advertisers, do you think it can open the window for independent journalism?
JA: I hope so! But it hasn't been determined yet. In the case of WikiLeaks, we have mostly been crowdfunded throughout our whole history. However WikiLeaks has a worldwide base reporting on high-profile conflicts. It's hard -- if we didn't have that worldwide base and publish in such scale, then we wouldn't break even through crowdfunding. So we have to say that there are some examples of where it has been done successfully. It may just be a matter of adjusting the parameters to increase the ease with which it can be done.
SY: This form of media will necessarily get rid of the "middle man" like editors and curators and connect the readers and journalists directly, and this is what Byline is doing. The only criterion for whether a journalistic project will be able to take place is whether readers want it or not. What's your thought on such form of media that takes out the middlemen like curators and editors?
JA: The more sources of funding there are for journalism, the better, because journalism is constrained by its funders and their particular political views, their worldview and their business interests. So the more types of funding we can get, be they crowdfunding for individual journalists; or some novel form of stock investment scheme; whether they are mutual societies; whether they are subscription or advertising-based funding models; or public journalism funded from tax revenues spent at the discretion of the government; or whether there is constitutional garnishing of tax funds for independent bodies, spent in accordance with population surveys. We need all these things to gain different perspectives.
SY: The analysis of Emily Bell, director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, is that the fourth estate has been killed by a few unaccountable Silicon Valley companies:
"News spaces are no longer owned by newsmakers. The press is no longer in charge of the free press and has lost control of the main conduits through which stories reach audiences. The public sphere is now operated by a small number of private companies, based in Silicon Valley."
In some sense, it's not Rupert Murdoch that controls the distribution of news, but Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg. Simply put, do you prefer Eric Schmidt to Rupert Murdoch?
JA: I would prefer neither. Google collects extensive amounts of information on every single person who uses the Internet. It tracks nearly every single web page you go to. Even if you think you are not using Google, you are, because those websites [you do visit] use Google. It collects information from Android phones in extraordinary detail on people's movements and interests -- and of course, everything they search for, and their emails if they use Gmail, and what videos they watch on YouTube.
"Google has decided a very important social policy, which is that there was not to be proper reportage of war."
Google's real business is the integration business. It's not a search business, it's not an advertising businesses -- it's an integration business. They take hundreds of sources of information across the world, they purchase startups that gained users and they integrate all this information to build up bigger, richer profiles on people, building it into a larger repository of information, which they then use to train their artificial intelligence algorithms. YouTube has become the largest collection of human video footage, which is being used to train Google's artificial intelligence algorithm, which will go into its drones. It has bought many companies that navigate the world, using material collected by Google maps and Android phones, so it's a massive integrationist project.
SY: But there are some people that can ask why this is bad. I mean, doesn't it help search what we want to?
JA: Philosophically, this is the tyranny of efficiency -- that which is more efficient must be good. But that is not true. If suddenly you go from one person having no weapons, to another person having a stick, to one person having a rifle, to another person having a gun, it's not necessarily an improvement.
Put that aside. Look at Google's increasing monopoly power -- Google's geometrically increasing monopoly power. In terms of media, we've seen in the past 10 years a great flourishing as a result of disconnecting distribution from content production. That's what's really freed it up. The two things that really freed up the media landscape are the tremendous decrease in cost, and disconnecting distribution from content production. Google and Facebook and Twitter and AT&amp;T and Cable &amp; Wireless had been following that model over the last few years. In the last few years there has been vertical integration and increasing political control in content production and content distribution. For example, Facebook, and all these organizations, are increasingly mandating new sets of rules about what can be published and what cannot be published. And these rules are increasing in number with great rapidity. These form a new system of social laws, created by fiat, not produced by a parliament, not produced by democracy, and with no balancing power or judiciary. They are now applied to essentially everyone who uses the Internet.
Just two days ago, there was the issue with antiwar.com, a libertarian right-wing anti-war, anti-militarist website in the U.S.. They published many great essays in the past 10 years, including essays on the Abu Ghraib scandal. Google decided that they would not accept its advertising brokering services to appear on any webpage where there were photos of war, because they are gruesome. So Google has decided a very important social policy, which is that there was not to be proper reportage of war. By fiat.
Please stay tuned for the final part of the series, coming within the next two weeks. Byline thanks Alex Nunns (@alexnunns) for his assistance in editing this interview.

Guantanamo Bay Revelations From WikiLeaks
of


As the New York Times reports, Mohammed Qahtani -- a Saudi believed to have been an intended participant in the Sept. 11 attacks -- was subject to coercive questioning and other abuses during his interrogation. The cables describe Qahtani as being leashed like a dog, sexually humiliated and forced to urinate on himself. His file says, "Although publicly released records allege detainee was subject to harsh interrogation techniques in the early stages of detention," his confessions "appear to be true and are corroborated in reporting from other sources."
As Le Monde is reporting, one "low-value" Iranian-Catholic detainee was kept in Guantanamo even after being deemed ready for release -- given his "cooperative nature" and in the interest of "possible financing relations" between Al Qaeda and traffickers. According to the cables, Abdul Majid Muhammed was deemed fit for release in 2002: "The detainee is not affiliated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. He was involved in drug trafficking. It is unlikely that he represents a risk for the U.S. or its allies."
An Al Jazeera journalist was reportedly held at Guantanamo Bay for six years partially so he could be interrogated about the network Sami al-Hajj, a Sudanese national and Al Jazeera cameraman, was captured in Pakistan in late 2001. Though he was never convicted or even tried of any terrorist ties, al-Hajj was held until 2008 because interrogators wanted to find out more about "the al-Jazeera news network's training programme, telecommunications equipment, and newsgathering operations in Chechnya, Kosovo and Afghanistan, including the network's acquisition of a video of UBL [Osama bin Laden] and a subsequent interview with UBL," according to the cables.
Some detainees are described as ruthlessly violent in the documents. As the New York Times reports, one detainee said "he would like to tell his friends in Iraq to find the interrogator, slice him up, and make a shwarma (a type of sandwich) out of him, with the interrogator's head sticking out of the end of the shwarma." Another "threatened to kill a U.S. service member by chopping off his head and hands when he gets out," and informed a guard that "he will murder him and drink his blood for lunch. Detainee also stated he would fly planes into houses and prayed that President Bush would die."
As the Washington Post reports, the documents describe a major gathering of some of Al Qaeda's most senior operatives in early December 2001. They included Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the self-described mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks; Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged planner of the USS Cole attack; and Abu Faraj al-Libbi, a key facilitator for bin Laden. After returning to Karachi, Mohammed "put together a training program for assassinations and kidnappings as well as pistol and computer training."
The leaked files indicate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told Guantanamo Bay interrogators that Al Qaeda had hidden a nuclear bomb in Europe which will unleash a "nuclear hellstorm" if Osama bin Laden is captured or killed. The terror group also planned to make a 9/11 style attack on London's Heathrow airport by crashing a hijacked airliner into one of the terminals, the files showed.
The Washington Post reports Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the alleged planner of the USS Cole attack, "received injections to promote impotence" to avoid being distracted by women, and "recommended the injections to others so more time could be spent on the jihad."
Gitmo detainees are reportedly assessed "high," "medium" or "low" in terms of their intelligence value, the threat they pose while in detention and the continued threat they might pose to the United States if released. As Reuters reports, most of the 172 remaining prisoners have been rated as a "high risk" of posing a threat to the United States and its allies if released without adequate rehabilitation and supervision.
Gitmo authorities named Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency a "terrorist organization" along with Hamas and other international militant networks, according to leaked documents. As the Associated Press reports, the ISI is part of a list that includes more than 60 international militant networks, as well as Iran's intelligence services, that  are "terrorist" entities or associations and say detainees linked to them "may have provided support to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, or engaged in hostilities against U.S. and coalition forces."

Police are warning residents to beware of a giant rhea bird that escaped into the countryside of Nottinghamshire, England, this week. The ostrich-sized bird reportedly fled a private collection in the area either Monday night or Tuesday morning.
"We are warning local people and particularly those with small children to be on their guard and not to approach the bird, which poses a very real threat to the public," police said .
Rheas, native to Brazil and Argentina , can reach heights of up to six feet, run 40 mph, and have sharp claws capable of disemboweling a human being with a single blow.
But bird expert David Lindo told the BBC that the rhea isn't as dangerous as people think, and is more likely to flee humans than to attack them.
"They're quite stealthy and they'll be running off, hiding into the bushes. ... They can melt into the countryside quite easily," Lindo said.
A fugitive rhea roamed the English countryside for two months in 2014. It was eventually shot and turned into gourmet sausages.
We can only hope this rhea will find its way home to its mate, reportedly pacing its enclosure in distress.

        <title>P5+1 and Iran Have Settled Framework for Sanctions Relief Timing, Says Iranian Sources</title>

        <MainBody>reddit
Contrary to public posturing on the timing and pace of sanctions relief, a framework for handling this critical matter of the nuclear deal has been resolved, according to Iranian sources.
Iranian officials have on numerous occasions insisted that sanctions relief must come immediately upon the signing of an agreement. This has been at direct odds with the position of the U.S. government and its allies, who insist that relief only can come after Iran has taken numerous steps limiting its nuclear activities.
As often times is the case in diplomacy, the solution was found in a combination of a play with words and practical measures.
This is exactly what the diplomats did to reconcile the Iranian insistence on front loaded sanctions relief and the Western position of relief being provided only after the International Atomic Energy Agency has verified Iranian steps to curtail its nuclear program.
According to Iranian sources, the agreement is divided into three phases. The initial phase -- called "adoption of agreement" -- takes places as the two sides agree on a final deal. This phase will kick in in the next few days -- if a deal is reached.
The next phase -- the operationalization of the agreement -- will begin once the domestic political processes of various parties have conclusively approved the agreement. This phase has been added primarily as a result of the US Congress passing the Corker bill, in which the American legislature gave itself the right to review and vote on the nuclear deal.
The timing of the second phase is directly related to the duration of the Congressional review process. If the two sides come to an agreement prior to July 10, the review process is set at 30 calendar days , in addition to 22 calendar days for Congress to pass a resolution to accept or reject the deal and for the President to use his veto, if need be. If the two sides fail to reach a deal by July 10, the Congressional review process increases to 60 calendar days.
While other states in the negotiations may also initiate some form of internal review and approval process, none of them are expected to take as long as the Congressional review. As such, the U.S. congress has significantly delayed the implementation of a presumptive deal.
Once the deal has survived the Congressional review -- whether through a resolution of affirmation or the failure to pass a resolution of rejection -- the Iranians will begin implementing the first steps of their commitments. This is phase III. The initiation of the implementation of their end of the deal must then be verified by the IAEA, after which the US and its allies will begin relieving sanctions. It is at this point that the deal will be "signed," enabling the Iranian demand for sanctions relief to occur upon signing of the deal to be upheld.
The exact timing of this schedule depends on the date the deal is adopted, the duration of the Congressional review and the time it takes for Iran to implement the first steps of the agreement. But at best it will begin a few months after the adoption of the deal. This is reflected by President Hassan Rouhani's statement earlier in June that he expected relief from sanctions within a "couple of months" after an agreement is reached .
While agreement on these principles of the process is a very important step forward, some question marks remain. What kind of a binding commitment will the U.S. and its allies make to reciprocate Iranian implementation of the deal, as the first steps taken will be Iranian? At what point will the UN Security Council adopt a resolution that affirms the deal?
While these are important details that must be settled, it is more important that the framework for the process has been agreed upon.

By J.R. Wu and Pichi Chuang
TAIPEI, June 28 (Reuters) - The number of party revelers  injured in a fire at a Taiwan water park rose to 519 on Sunday,  as authorities began investigating the cause, suspected to be a  sudden explosion of a colored powder thrown on those attending  the party.
Six foreigners and seven visitors from Hong Kong, mainland  China and Macau were among those injured after about 1,000  people dancing at Saturday's event were sprayed with the powder,  as a special feature of a festival also held in previous years.
The blaze, which broke out around 8.30 p.m. at the Formosa  Fun Coast water park on the outskirts of the capital, Taipei, is  suspected to have been caused by an explosion of the colored  powder, local government official Lin Chieh-yu told Reuters.
"It remains under investigation as to what made the powder  explode," he added, however.
Authorities have banned the use of the powder until the  investigation is completed and its safety can be assured.
"The next few days will be a critical time for the injured,"  Taiwan Premier Mao Chi-kuo told reporters. Of the 519 injured,  419 are still being treated in 41 hospitals across the island.
In the immediate aftermath of the explosion, rescuers  treated hundreds of people, most of them aged between 20 and 30,  who wore wet swimsuits and lay on inflatable plastic doughnuts.
A video posted online by Apple Daily showed dancers in front of the stage engulfed in clouds of colored powder a moment  before a fireball erupted, followed by pockets of flame,  triggering panic and screams.
"There was blood and people were on fire," one injured man   said.
No death has yet been reported, but victims suffered burns  on limbs and torsos, with some passing out from the pain while  others had burned clothes stuck to their skin, media reports and  pictures showed.
"Her whole life is ruined," sobbed the father of Chu Li, an  18-year-old girl with burns on 80 percent of her body, during a  visit by President Ma Ying-jeou to victims in a Taipei hospital.
Soldiers, army vehicles and medical services joined the  rescue effort, while hospitals in four municipal precincts,  along with Taipei, are treating sufferers.
The amusement park has been closed temporarily, it said on  its website on Sunday.
Taipei has sweltered in temperatures exceeding 30 degrees  Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) in recent weeks.     (Additional reporting by Faith Hung; Editing by Clarence  Fernandez)

        <MainBody>reddit
How much terrorism can the world take in 24 hours? Friday 26 June, 2015 will certainly go down in history as a day that pushed the limit.
Just in case the daily dose of evil committed by the likes of ISIS or Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq wasn't enough, we witnessed three additional horrific attacks done in the name of Islam yesterday.
In Kuwait , a deadly bomb took the lives of 27 innocent people and injured 200 others in an ISIS attack on a Shiite mosque.
In the Tunisian resort town of Sousse, at least 38 innocent people were killed and dozens wounded when at least one ISIS gunman opened fire at a beachside resort. Meanwhile, a headless body and Islamist flags were found at the scene of an attack on a gas factory near France's second largest city, Lyon.
Here is what will happen next: leaders of affected countries will visit the wounded and vow retaliation, world leaders and concerned parties will condemn, the press will talk about it for a few days.
Then, the story will die and terrorism will be forgotten - until it strikes again.
'Quiet condoners'
The madness needs to stop. But this will not happen as long as there are Muslims who, while not actively participating in these crimes, still think the likes of ISIS have grounds for what they are doing,
People might say the above argument echoes the rather unpopular (but accurate nevertheless) views of British PM David Cameron who recently accused many British Muslims of quietly condoning the ISIS ideology.
Now, while it remains a puzzle how anyone can agree - privately or publicly - with this group's evil creed; one has to wonder if these "quiet condoners" realize that it is Muslims - and nobody else - who are ultimately being hurt the most?
Putting aside the innocent Christian, Jewish and/or Muslim lives that these terrorist acts take, let us not forget that after almost each one of these attacks, hate crimes against Muslims increase and Muslim communities end up finding it harder to be accepted, to find jobs and to integrate.
Some might ask: what about Muslim grievances regarding occupied lands, unjust causes and unfair treatment, which these terrorist groups claim to be fighting for?
In response to that question, one can only ask how many of these grievances, while legitimate, have been solved by terrorism? If anything, the likes of ISIS and al-Qaeda has made these causes worse and much more complicated to resolve.
As simple as this truth is, many people refuse to see it and this is probably the reason why I remain extremely pessimistic about our region. Perhaps one positive thought remains. It is said that the night is darkest just before the dawn - I don't think our night can get any darker!

BRUSSELS, June 28 (Reuters) - Europe's grand project to bind its nations into an unbreakable union by means of a common currency lurched into uncharted waters after EU governments refused funding to save Greece from defaulting on its debts.
While finance ministers of the other 18 euro zone states chorused their insistence that Greece would remain inside the bloc, exasperation with the leftist government's decision to reject creditors' final offer and instead call a referendum was manifest and some officials spoke privately of expelling Athens.
"They were playing poker," said Austrian Finance Minister Hans Joerg Schelling after the Eurogroup that runs the currency met on Saturday without their Greek counterpart to discuss how to limit the fallout. "But in poker, you can always lose."
After five months of negotiations with a Greek government elected to end the pain of austerity measures, EU leaders left a summit in Brussels on Friday believing a deal was close to roll over bailout funding and let Athens meet a repayment to the IMF on Tuesday and further obligations over the coming months.
But Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras provoked consternation by returning home to call a referendum for next Sunday on the offer and urging voters, weary of years of debt crises, to reject it.
Not for the first time, EU officials said Greek negotiators across the table were themselves taken by surprise by news from Athens. "They heard about the referendum on Twitter," one said.
"Tsipras messed up," a euro zone official said. "We did everything possible. They chose to blow up when we were so close to settling this in a way that would allow them to sell it."
Amid political drama in Greece, where a clear majority wants to remain inside the bloc, the next few days present a major challenge to the integrity of a 16-year-old currency bloc, which many blame for massive unemployment in countries outside Germany and its neighbors in the richer north and west of Europe.
RISK MANAGEMENT
"We must do everything we can to fight any conceivable threat of contagion," German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said after a meeting at which the group effectively called for capital controls to ring-fence Greek banks hemorrhaging cash.
While acknowledging that only Greece - or possibly banks themselves - can instigate such a shutdown, the ministers said the European Central Bank, whose management meets on Sunday, should use its powers to stabilize markets.
"You have to count on Greece getting into acute problems in the coming days because of this decision," said Schaeuble, some of whose conservative allies have made no secret of preferring to see Greece forced out of the euro zone. "That is difficult as we do not know how it will live up to its commitments."
He and others, however, stressed their faith in stability mechanisms put in place after skepticism among investors pushed the euro zone to breaking point following a run of national bankruptcy scares in the wake of the global crash of 2008.
And, echoing his French Socialist counterpart, Michel Sapin, Schaeuble insisted after the fifth such deadlocked ministerial meeting in just over a week: "Greece remains a member of the euro zone and Greece remains part of Europe."
But there is a divergence, certainly in tone, between Berlin and Paris. Sapin insisted the Eurogroup at least discuss the Greek request for an extension on Saturday but Schaeuble and most others had lost patience, sources close to the talks said.
Afterwards, Sapin said he was still ready to negotiate, a view repeated on Sunday in Paris by Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
But few EU leaders now trust this Greek government, whose calls for debt relief and criticisms of the bailout's deadening effect on growth have been echoed by some leading economists.
When representatives of the three creditor institutions - euro zone governments, the ECB and IMF - met after Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis had left, participants quoted one senior official as joking that at least they could refer again to the lenders as the "Troika," a term Varoufakis had insisted be dropped because Greeks associated it with external diktats.
Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Eurogroup chairman, repeatedly referred to the possibility that the Greek parliament might reject Tsipras's call for a referendum. But lawmakers dashed any prospect of a quick shift in Greek politics before markets open on Monday by voting for it to go ahead.
Still, Dijsselbloem insisted: "The process has not ended. It will never end probably. We will continue to work with Greece. Many things could happen, many scenarios are conceivable."
As Greeks lined up to take cash from ATMs, it remained to be seen how financial mechanisms would work. If Greece fails, as it has said it will, to repay 1.6 billion euros to the IMF on Tuesday, that default can have knock-on effects.
Greece could stay in the euro zone but also issue a local currency to pay bills -- a form of "Grexit" recommended on Sunday by influential German economist Hans-Werner Sinn of Ifo.
The ECB must also decide whether to keep supplying liquidity to Greek banks, once the government whose debt makes up a large chunk of their assets is no longer meeting its obligations and once the bailout program formally expires on Tuesday.
POLITICAL FALLOUT
The central bank, under its president Mario Draghi, has been reluctant to take such a highly politicized decision. At the same time, political leaders have been reluctant to override the decisions of finance ministers lest that appear to be a signal that the rules of the common currency are open to manipulation.
Donald Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who chairs meetings of the 28 EU leaders, made clear at two summits in the past week that heads of government must nonetheless take their responsibilities in a crisis that affects the Union as a whole.
Early on Sunday, he was in contact with leaders again: "Greece is and should remain euro area member," Tusk tweeted.
The Greek government's demands have alienated its euro zone partners - from Germany and its northern allies, to southern states and Ireland whose governments face critics of their own bailout terms to easterners much less prosperous than Greece.
But with Britain already planning a referendum on leaving the EU, a breach in formal institutions worries those who fear economic drift. Complaints it lacks democratic accountability threaten the EU's survival in its present form.
One official close to Saturday's Eurogroup discussions said the issue of Greece leaving the euro, or the EU, was not raised - there is no obvious legal way to force it out of either. But, the official said, a "Grexit" could not be entirely ruled out.
Leaving Brussels on what he called a "sad day for Europe," the outspoken Varoufakis warned that the rift with Athens would damage the euro zone's credibility as a "democratic union" -  "And I'm very much afraid that that damage will be permanent."

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP)  A fire on a music stage spread into a crowd of spectators at a party Saturday night at a Taiwan water park, injuring more than 200 people, authorities said.
An accidental explosion of an unknown powder set off the fire near the stage in front of about 1,000 spectators, said Wang Wei-sheng, a liaison with the New Taipei City fire department command center.

The seemingly never-ending Greek drama has become a story of amateurism versus dogmatism with incompetence and cowardice on both sides. The Greek government has squandered all its goodwill within half a year through a combination of arrogance, belligerence, naivety and utter incompetence. It set out to restore the "dignity" of the Greek people by "liberating" them from the alleged stranglehold of the Troika, while in the process "transforming" Europe into a more equal and just continent. It has achieved neither. The current Greek government is confronted with almost exactly the same deal as its so maligned predecessor. Moreover, outside of (West) European gauche caviar, desperate for a new "anti-imperialist hero" after Hugo Chavez's death, support for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his Coalition for a Radical Left (Syriza) has evaporated its amid erratic behavior and endless accusations of "blackmail" and "betrayal." Even worse, they have strengthened the belief among its opponents that (all) Euro-skepticism is necessarily incompetent and moralistic.
The so often repeated claim that the Troika is "disingenuous" is not just evidence of the typical moralistic discourse of populism, in which the other side is "the enemy" that is "corrupt," but, even more importantly, shows the Greek government's utter misperception of its opponent(s). Whether they truly believe their accusations or not is not that relevant, although it does go to the question whether they are simply incompetent or (also) disingenuous. In essence, the Greek government is accusing the Troika of being -- well -- the Troika! It blames them for not supporting the Syriza program. The Troika largely does the same, of course, but uses overall a more technocratic, rather than moralistic, discourse.
The essence of this drama is that both camps are informed by fundamentally different visions and try to come to an impossible compromise on the basis of a warped view of each other. The Greek government thinks the Troika is essentially committed to a strong Europe than to the politics of austerity, and the Troika still thinks that Greece is a typical European state, which in their view means a Northern European state. Hence, Tsipras keeps presenting "fairer" options, while Merkel keeps calling for "rational reforms." While both can be criticized for incompetence and immorality, the costs are clearly much higher for Tsipras' Greeks than for Merkel's Germans.
Whatever the logic and morality of the austerity politics, and both can be seriously questioned, the Troika has been absolutely clear that this is the foundation of its Eurozone politics. It might be rigid, but it is straightforward and, therefore, honest. In sharp contrast, the Greek government, both Syriza and coalition partner Independent Greeks (ANEL), has been far from clear in its position. It has invented a third option, Eurozone without austerity, which from the outset has been rejected by the Troika. More fundamentally, however, Syriza proclaims to be a radical left party, which supports an economic model somewhere in between socialism and social democracy. It wants to realize this within the European Union and the Eurozone, which are both fundamentally neoliberal projects, in which substantial state involvement in the economy is considered wrong.
The current standoff was inevitable as soon as the Greek population voted Syriza into power. In essence, therefore, both ANEL/Syriza and their supporters are responsible for the situation that they find themselves in now. They can blame the Troika for being, and staying true to being, the Troika, but that doesn't change the reality. Tsipras' call for a referendum took much of the rest of the European Union, and perhaps many in Greece, by surprise. Pundits will undoubtedly see it as further proof of the highly rational (choice) strategy of 'game theorist' and Finance Minister Varoufakis, trying to put extra pressure on the Troika.  However, their archenemy Papandreou did the same in 2011 and failed (too).
In classic populist language Tsipras called for a "democratic response" to the creditors that try to "humiliate" Greece. Varoufakis tweeted that the referendum will "boost" democracy in "euro-related matters." Responding to reactions that he had been elected to make these decisions, as this is how representative democracies work, he said that the government doesn't have a mandate to make this important decision because only 41 percent of the people voted for ANEL and Syriza. This is a bizarre argument, which, in extremism, would mean that the government should resign, as it doesn't represent the majority of the Greek people. Moreover, it hasn't stopped Syriza in the last months from claiming to speak in the name of "the people," i.e. not just for a majority but for all (pure) Greek people. Incidentally, the righteous claim of boosting democracy was already undermined by ANEL leader Panos Kammenos, who said that the Greferendum would be withdrawn if the creditors would accept their counteroffer.
Rather than boosting democracy the more likely reason for the referendum is to prevent a break up of the government and of Syriza. As a literal coalition of more and less radical left groups Syriza is only really united in the opposition to the bailout conditions. The 'party' is fundamentally divided on continued membership of the Eurozone and even the European Union. However, if democracy is really so important to Varoufakis and the others, they should put the interests of the country and its population above those of the coalition government and the political party.
Tsipras has called a referendum on the very narrow issue of the specific terms offered by the creditors for the latest aid package. This is a ridiculous proposal on several accounts. First, the referendum will have to be organized within one week by a state with limited capacity under the best of circumstances, let alone in the height of an economic and political crisis. Second, the terms offered by the creditors are not even public yet (let alone translated into Greek). How can people vote on them if they haven't seen them? Third, the referendum is framed purely as a vote on the terms of the creditors, as if there is an option to get the financial aid under different terms. And, even if this were to be the case, and all behavior and statements of the Troika members makes this highly doubtful, what will happen then, i.e. in the best case scenario: Another referendum on the amended terms?
There is a good case to be made for a Greek referendum, but it is not this one. The Greeks should get a straightforward choice between the only two realistic options: staying in the Eurozone under the stated conditions or leaving the Eurozone (and allegedly have their "dignity" and "democracy" back). This is the fundamental choice that should have informed Greek politics for the past years. Greeks could have had that vote in the January elections, but Syriza prevented it by offering a faux third option: stay in the Eurozone without the Eurozone conditions. Now that everyone knows there are only two options, Syriza should finally give the people a vote on them, be it in new elections or in a (well-prepared) referendum.

ATHENS, June 27 (Reuters) - More than a third of automated teller machines across Greece ran out of cash on Saturday before they were replenished as Greeks pulled out money on fears their country was set to crash out of the euro, three banking sources said.
Anxious Greeks lined up outside ATMs after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras made a surprise call for a referendum on austerity terms demanded by lenders, throwing talks with lenders in disarray and putting Greece on the verge of a default.
About 35 percent of the ATM network - some 2,000 out of the 5,500 ATMs across Greece - ran out of euro banknotes at one point during the day and were being replenished, the bankers said. Banks were working in coordination with the central bank to keep the network fed with cash, they said.
Replenishing ATMs usually takes one to two hours per ATM, leading to the long lines, one banking source said.
Around 600 million euros was withdrawn from the banking system on Saturday, one senior banker at one of Greece's four big lenders told Reuters. A second banker estimated the outflow at more than 500 million euros.
Though that was below the level of over 1 billion euros seen on some days over the past two weeks, the figure was almost exclusively from ATM withdrawals, where the average daily limit of cash that can be taken out is 600 to 700 euros, bankers said.
"Demand for cash is definitely higher than what you see on a normal Saturday," one of the bankers said.
"This does not mean that there are lines everywhere but we are trying to keep ATMs fed with banknotes."
Minutes after Tsipras's address to the nation, small lines could be seen at some ATMs in Athens. In addition to lines at various ATMs across the country on Saturday, a line of about 40 people could be seen at an ATM inside the Greek parliament.
Greece's government has insisted that banks will reopen as normal on Monday and denied the country will have to impose capital controls to prevent the banks collapsing.
The banks depend on emergency liquidity from the European Central Bank to stay open, and senior government officials held talks with the ECB chief Mario Draghi on Saturday to ensure continued support to banks amid the crisis.  (Writing by Deepa Babington; editing by Ralph Boulton)

        <MainBody>Senators Visit Cuba Hoping Congress Will Ease Restrictions

By Daniel Trotta
HAVANA, June 27 (Reuters) - Three visiting U.S. senators  said on Saturday they hoped Congress would support President  Barack Obama's opening toward Cuba, including lifting a ban on  U.S. citizens traveling to the Communist-run island.
Democratic Senators Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Ben Cardin  of Maryland joined Republican Dean Heller of Nevada on a trip to  Cuba where they met First Vice-President Miguel Diaz-Canel,  Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez and ordinary Cubans.
A number of Cuba initiatives are pending in the Senate,  including a bill to remove the travel ban on Americans and a  more ambitions bill to rescind the decades-old U.S. economic  embargo.
Obama, a Democrat, has called on Congress to act but the  legislation is opposed by the Republican leadership in control  of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
Earlier this month, the House rejected a measure that would  have relaxed travel restrictions. But the senators said there  were better prospects for progress on Cuba legislation in their  chamber.
"We think that can be achieved this year and we can make  additional progress next year," Cardin told a news conference.  "We're optimistic this path that President Obama and President  (Raul) Castro started will be continued."
Heller, one of a few Republican senators to side with Obama  on Cuba, encouraged members of Congress to visit Cuba and engage  with ordinary Cubans. "I think the Senate can move the House,  but the Senate's going to have to act first," Heller told  Reuters after the news conference.
Currently, some Americans may travel to Cuba with official  permission but general tourism is banned.
Breaking decades of Cold War-era hostility, Obama and Castro   announced plans last December to restore diplomatic ties that  Washington severed in 1961, and to work toward normalizing  overall relations. An announcement on reopening embassies in  both capitals is expected soon.     (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Frances Kerry)

SUNRISE, Fla.  For the first time, a Chinese player has been selected in the NHL draft.
Andong Song was chosen by the New York Islanders with the No. 172 pick in the draft Saturday. The defenseman, who goes by the name "Misha," started playing hockey on a smaller-than-normal rink in Beijing when his mother was trying to find him a sport. Once his talent was spotted, his family moved to Canada and he quickly excelled when he began playing as a 10-year-old.

Now his pro rights belong to the Islanders, his selection broadcast live in China.
"Feels like I'm a star already," said Andong, who was followed by a Chinese television crew Saturday. "But, long way to go."
The fact he's made it this far is something in itself.
When his family moved to Ontario and coaches there heard that a Chinese boy was trying out, there was plenty of skepticism. He proved himself at each level, and was an assistant captain this past season on the varsity at Lawrenceville School in New Jersey.
The 18-year-old Andong, who plays on one of China's national teams, plans to attend Philips Andover Academy in Massachusetts this coming school year as a postgraduate student.
After that, he expects to play college hockey.
"I'm really honored to be the first Chinese player to be drafted," Andong said. "It's been great so far."
He hasn't yet met Islanders owner and governor Charles B. Wang, who was born in Shanghai and moved to the U.S. with his family as a boy. Andong said he and his agent were aware of interest from the Islanders for some time, but didn't absolutely know for certain that he was getting picked until his name was called.
"Being the first Chinese player, it's a lot of pressure from people back home, but good pressure," Andong said. "I hope that will motivate me to become a better player and hopefully I'll make them proud."
One of his earliest memories is watching the U.S. play against Russia at the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002. China is trying to land the 2022 Winter Games, which is one of many reasons why the game seems to be growing there rapidly.
"When I started playing there weren't a lot of people playing there and not much support for the game," said Andong, whose brother still plays in Beijing. "But last year when I went back, it'd been like eight years since I've seen Chinese hockey, it's just been tremendous how far they've grown. I'm sure they'll keep trying to catch up to North America and Europe and Russia, but there's still a little gap."

FONTAINES-SUR-SAONE, France (AP) -- Officials say the top suspect in the beheading of a French businessman took a "selfie" photo with the slain victim and sent the image to at least one recipient.
Two French officials said authorities were working to confirm the identity of the recipient, but were not able to immediately confirm media reports that it was sent to an unspecified person in Syria.
On Friday, key suspect Yassine Salhi allegedly crashed a truck into an U.S.-owned chemical warehouse and hung his employer's severed head on a factory gate in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier - in what authorities are calling a terror attack.
He was arrested and remained in police custody on Saturday.
Authorities noted the similarity to tactics used by the Islamic State group, though no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

ATHENS, Greece (AP)  Greece's parliament voted early Sunday in favor of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' motion to hold a July 5 referendum on creditor proposals for reforms in exchange for loans, with the country's future in the eurozone looking increasingly shaky.
Tsipras' surprise call stunned Greece's international debt negotiators, and the country took a big step closer to falling out of the euro currency union after fellow eurozone member states refused to extend its bailout program past its expiry date on Tuesday, leaving Greece on the brink of financial chaos.
In the streets of Greece, worried people queued outside banks for cash from dawn to dusk after Tsipras' announcement in the early hours of Saturday, after billions of euros had already been emptied in the preceding weeks.
Greece has a 1.6 billion euro ($1.8 billion) debt due to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday and its bailout program expires the same day, after which it is unclear how the country might survive financially.
The referendum is set for next Sunday with the question on whether to accept proposed reforms needed to get bailout loans from other eurozone countries and the IMF. The government is advocating a rejection of the proposals.
The radical left-wing leader accused the creditors of using blackmail and ultimatums against his proud but struggling people. European officials and all Greek opposition parties except the extremist far-right Golden Dawn party called his move for a vote a foolish and rash gambit that effectively ended negotiations to keep Greece financially afloat.
The sudden move comes after five months of stalemated negotiations, with Tsipras accusing creditors of trying to strong-arm his country into taking harsh austerity measures he says would hammer an economy already on its knees after months of creditor-demanded spending cuts and tax hikes.
"They didn't ask us to agree, they asked us to surrender our political dignity," Tsipras said during a tumultuous and nearly 13-hour parliamentary session that cumulated in a vote just before 3 a.m. Sunday. Out of parliament's 300 lawmakers, 178 voted in favor and 120 against, with two people absent.
He insisted the Greek side had "exhausted every limit" of concessions so there could be an agreement, adding that "perhaps some saw that as a weakness."
The referendum move further crumbled already strained relations between Greece and its European partners.
Tsipras said the Greek people would vote against a deal next Sunday.
"This no will also be a big yes, a big yes to the decision of the Greek government to reject an ultimatum that insults the Greek people."
Tsipras dismissed harsh criticism from other European countries on his decision.
"The referendum will take place as scheduled, next Sunday, whether our partners want it or not," he said.
Eurozone finance ministers earlier rejected Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis' request for a one-month extension to the bailout program, with Varoufakis then leaving the meeting.
"It's a sad day for Europe, but we will overcome it," he said.
The other 18 finance ministers then huddled without him to assess how to minimize the damage from the Greek crisis on their currency.
"Our institutions are and will be prepared to take any action if needed," said top eurozone official Jeroen Dijsselbloem of fears that financial turbulence might extend to the rest of the currency bloc. Fellow ministers spoke candidly about the risks of a Greek exit from the euro in a way that would have been inconceivable only weeks ago.
The ministers stressed Greece remained in the eurozone for now, and Dijsselbloem said "the eurogroup stands ready to reconvene to take appropriate decisions where needed, in the interest of Greece as euro area member."
Without a bailout program extension or more loans from creditors, Greece is likely to be in arrears on a debt payment due the same day. Its banks face the risk of collapse.
"The Greek authorities have asked for a month extension. But in that month there can be no disbursements," Dijsselbloem said. "How does the Greek government think that it will survive and deal with its problems in that period? I do not know."
France's finance minister, Michel Sapin, stressed a deal was still possible and that he was ready to act as a go-between among Greece and the creditors after relations neared a breaking point.
Dijsselbloem refused to slam the door full shut. "The door is open. It was not the institutions that walked away from the last talks last night."
Now much will depend on whether the European Central Bank will accept to continue to prop up Greek banks even after the country's bailout program expires. It would be under huge pressure to stop using eurozone taxpayer money to keep alive the banks if there is no prospect for a deal.
The eurozone finance ministers suggested Greece should take steps to stabilize its financial system  code for putting limits on cash withdrawals and money transfers.
If Greece's banks collapse, the government would have to support them itself. Penniless, it would have to revert to printing a new currency, effectively drawing the country out of the euro union.
The ECB's governing council will meet "in due course" to assess the situation, most likely this Sunday, officials said.
While Greece's government is recommending a "no" vote on the referendum, Varoufakis noted "the high possibility that the Greek people will vote against the advice of the Greek government."
What would happen in that case  whether Greece would have to leave the euro or try to renegotiate with creditors  is unclear.
An exit from the euro would put Greece through a new era of economic pain. With the new currency less valuable than the euro, the government would have to write off a chunk of its foreign loans  mainly owed to eurozone countries  and many companies and households would go bankrupt. Experts predict a long and deep recession in a country that has already been through five years economic depression.
The uncertainties of all this would roil European and global markets, though experts are divided on the extent. Some say Europe is better equipped to handle a Greek euro exit, but others say it is unclear what might happen. The euro dropped in value slightly on international markets after the referendum was called.

Unlike Osama bin Laden, who often appeared in videos to lecture and incite attacks against the West, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has kept a low profile, and was reportedly seen on camera only once since the militant group declared its caliphate a year ago in June. This makes the $10 million bounty on his whereabouts all the more elusive .
--&gt; More on ISIS from Vocativ : "Angel of Death," an axe-wielding university lecturer in Iraq had become a cult hero in the war against ISIS
The U.S. State Department in May put up major rewards to the tune of $20 million for the capture of ISIS top brass . Secretary of State John Kerry authorized a reward of $7 million for information on Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, $5 million each for leads on Abu Mohammed al-Adnani and Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili and $3 million for Tariq Bin-al-Tahar Bin al Falih al-Awni al-Harzi.
The biggest reward of $10 million is reserved for the person with information on al-Baghdadi, who has been on the State Departments most-wanted list since 2011, years before ISIS became a household name.
Since its inception, the State Departments Rewards for Justice program has forked over $125 million to over 80 people who have provided intel that helped put the wanted behind bars, according to its website. The programs biggest reward to date is $25 million for leads to bin Laden, but no one ever collected on that money.
The 43-year-old al-Baghdadi, also goes by the name Abu Dua. Overseing all ISIS operations, he is currently based in Syria.
According to the U.S. government, Baghdadi has taken personal credit for a series of deadly attacks in Iraq since 2011, including the June 2013 Abu Ghraib prison break and the March 2013 suicide bombing on the Ministry of Justice in which at least 20 people were killed.
Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli is a senior ISIS official who rejoined the group in Syria after his release from Iraqi prison in early 2012. Al-Qaduli joined al-Qaida in 2004 under the command of now deceased al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI) leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and served as al-Zarqawis deputy and the AQI amir (leader) of Mosul in northern Iraq.
Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, born Taha Sobhi Falaha in Syria, is the official spokesman for and a senior leader of ISIS. Al-Adnani is the main conduit for the dissemination of official messages, including ISIS declaration that it had established an Islamic caliphate.
Over the past several years, Syria-based Georgian national Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili, also known as Omar the Chechen, has held a number of top military positions within ISIS.
As of mid-2014, Batirashvili has been a senior ISIS commander and Shura Council member based in al-Raqqah, Syria. He was identified as the ISIS military commander in a public video distributed by the group in late June 2014. Batirashvili oversaw an ISIS prison facility in al-Tabqa, close to al-Raqqah, where the group possibly held foreign hostages. As of mid-2014, Batirashvili also coordinated closely with the groups financial section and had a base of operations for the terrorist organization in the Minbij, Syria area.
As of mid-2014, Tariq Bin-al-Tahar Bin al Falih al-Awni al-Harzi has been an ISIS official operating in Syria. He works to raise funds, recruit, equip and facilitate the travel of fighters for the terrorist organization. He also commands the groups suicide bombers. He works to provide material support to ISIS by procuring and shipping weapons with his brother from Libya and Syria, including raising funds from Gulf-based donors.

TUNIS, Tunisia (AP)  Thousands of tourists fled from Tunisia on Saturday after the country's worst terrorist attack killed 38 people  including 15 Britons  as the government struggles to prevent future jihadi attacks against the all-important tourism sector.
New measures to increase the numbers of troops on the streets and crack down on organizations with radical links, however, won't bring the tourists back in the short-term, further threatening the fragile economy.
When a 24-year-old Master's student at Kairouan University strolled on to the Sousse beach and pulled out a Kalashnikov assault rifle and grenades hidden inside his beach umbrella, he was sounding the death knell for Tunisia's 2015 tourist season.
Tunisian authorities identified the attacker as Seifeddine Rezgui, saying he killed 38 people, 15 of them British, as well as German, Irish, Belgian and Portuguese victims, and sent thousands of tourists fleeing to airports. The wounded included 24 Britons, seven Tunisians, three Belgians, and a German, Russian and Ukrainian.
"It's the first time I've ever been on holiday and feared for my life," said British tourist Matthew Preece, adding it was his third time visiting Tunisia and likely his last. "So obviously you can't come back somewhere it's not safe."
Tourists and employees are returning home with tales of horror cowering in rooms or offices as the killer stalked through the hotel wearing shorts.
European countries and tour operators sent planes to evacuate their citizens. By midday Saturday, nine flights had whisked away 1,400 people, according to Mohammed Walid Ben Ghachem, manager of the Enfidha-Hammamet Airport near Sousse.
At the Imperial Marhaba Hotel itself, the guests had left, according to manager Mohammed Becheur.
"We may have zero clients today, but we will keep our staff," he said, lamenting the 75-percent occupancy rate the day before. "This summer will be hard, but we are very confident for the long term."
On the beach, there were still a few tourists from neighboring hotels. Some laid flowers at the site of the attack while police patrolling on horseback moved down the beach and security boats patrolled the waters.
Armed men on the beach may well become a more common sight in Tunisia, as Prime Minister Habib Essid announced a raft of new security measures that many have questioned why they weren't implemented after the last horrific attack against tourists in March at the National Bardo Museum that killed 22.
"It's clear that the government's security policy requires a massive revision, in the sense that most of the tourist sites weren't well-protected," Tunisian security analyst Alaya Allani said. "If the measures announced are well implemented, we could reduce but not eradicate terrorism."
Essid called up the army reserves and said there would now be armed men in the hotels and at tourists sites and he also promised to crack down on unregulated mosques that preached extremist ideas and close down organizations with shadowy funding and extremist links.
North Africa analyst Geoff Porter noted that in the short term, these measures will only drive the extremists underground and create a militarized feel to the country that might well discourage tourism.
"Tunisia's in a difficult position, you can harden a tourist site and make it more difficult to attack but the same measures would deter tourists," he said. "Tourists don't want to come and lie on a beach with guys with AK-47s."
And Tunisia needs these tourists, especially in the coastal resort areas like Sousse where it is the dominant industry. Tourist made up nearly 15 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 and it has been struggling to recover after the shocks of the Arab Spring revolution.
The attack was claimed by the radical Islamic State group, which thousands of Tunisians, disaffected with the lack of opportunity in the wake of the 2011 overthrow of secular President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, have joined.
The attack came the same day that a suicide bomber killed 27 people in a Shiite mosque in Kuwait and a man in France ran his truck into a warehouse and hung his employer's severed head on the gate.
The attack in Kuwait was also claimed by the Islamic State and on Saturday thousands of people took part in a mass funeral procession. Police said they are interrogating a number of suspects with possible links to the bombing, which was claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
Extremists have increasingly attacked soldiers and politicians in Tunisia over the past few years, but it was only with the March museum attack that it began targeting the tourism life blood of the country that will only deepen its economic crisis.
The presence of a few people still on the beaches a day after the attack does give some glimmers of hope, especially if world memory is short and people return attracted by the low prices and white sands of the beach.
"We want to see our holiday out," said Peter Phillips of Wales as he stood on the beach not far from where the attack happened.
It all may hinge, however, on whether the government can put an end to these attacks, which senior security official Rafik Chelli called an "isolated incident" that is difficult to guard against and could happen anywhere.
"If this attack doesn't do it, any subsequent attack will," Porter said. "It is hard to envision Tunisian tourism recovering from this attack and impossible to envision it recovering from a third one."

        <MainBody>reddit
In his fiery remarks on June 23rd, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delineated major red lines in nuclear negotiations. According to his official twitter account , the seven items listed as red lines cover four basic areas: sanctions relief, sunset provisions for uranium enrichment, R&amp;D and access for International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) inspectors.
The red lines undoubtedly contrast with the framework agreement that was reached in Lausanne, according to the fact sheet published in April by the U.S. State Department. However, immediately following the U.S. State Department's publication of its fact sheet in April, Iran publicly disagreed with its contents. This was apparent when Ayatollah Khamenei declared that the fact sheet showed "devilish" American intentions.
Now, Khamenei's delineation of red lines has left many observers and politicians scratching their head, wondering why the Ayatollah would adopt such an aggressive posture as the Iran nuclear talks enter the last lap of this marathon. According to many experts, these red lines could most likely break the deal altogether.
There may be multiple explanations for these remarks.
Domestic public appearance
Perhaps the most popular explanation among experts and politicians, including the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is that the statements were designed for domestic consumption. "We are not going to be guided by or conditioned by or affected or deterred by some tweet that is for public consumption or domestic political consumption," Kerry reacted to the comments.
In other words, based on this argument, Ayatollah Khamenei issued the red lines to maintain stature among conservatives, as the leader that continues to spearhead resistance against the "global arrogance" led by the United States. However, this explanation is flawed.
If a deal is soon reached and Khamenei's red lines are crossed, his stature would severely suffer, likely resulting in dire consequences that might ultimately ensue. Those that dispute the notion of simple posturing for domestic consumption are his conservative supporters, primarily the security-military apparatus. What would they think of Vali-e Faqih (Guardian jurist), the symbol of revolutionary Islam, if a deal is struck and the red lines set by him are crossed? How can the Ayatollah explain that for the conservatives? Does he lack enough authority on the negotiating team or did his public opposition to apparently-negotiated terms amount to hollow rhetoric?
Effort to scuttle a deal
Another explanation is that as we near the precipice of negotiations, i.e., the actualization of a nuclear deal, Ayatollah Khamenei may be worried about the consequences of compromise on the nuclear issue so he set these strict red lines to torpedo the possibility of any deal.
A resolution to the nuclear crisis may lead to normalization of relations between Iran and the U.S. It is true that Iran seeks better relations with America to reduce threats to its survival, but the leadership harbors strong reservations about normal relations.
Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly asserted his opinion that because the Iranian establishment rejects foreign domination, the U.S. ultimately seeks regime change in its own effort to establish a puppet government. Drawing on experience from the 1953 coup, Ayatollah Khamenei contends that normal relations would prepare the grounds for infiltration by Americans' intelligence and spies who seek links to opposition inside Iran, undermining the nezam (state).
Additionally, normal relations will most likely lead to cultural exchanges which could erode religious beliefs in Iranian society and ultimately undermine the influence of the Islamic system.
Actualization of a nuclear deal could also be problematic from another angle. Iran's leader has repeatedly said , "I'm not optimistic about the talks and they will not get anywhere, but I'm not opposed to them." Therefore, the successful conclusion of nuclear talks would call into question the political vision and judgment of the Supreme Leader.
Saiid Ghasemi, a former commander of the IRGC and one of the leaders of the hard-line vigilante group, Ansar-e Hezbollah once remarked , "If the [nuclear] talks conclude we must say goodbye to the [the system] of Veyat-e faqih (guardianship of the jurist)," which is the foundation of Iran's Islamic system.
Despite all of the arguments which support scuttling a deal, Iran's ravaged economy threatens the very survival of the state. A poor economy could cause not only domestic unrest, but it also threatens its foothold and influence in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon as a means to confront the US, Israel, and Arab threats. Iran desperately needs sanctions relief and access to its estimated $100 billion in blocked assets.
In fact, Ayatollah Khamenei's dramatic shift in approach toward the US, abandoning the years-long policy of banning talks with them, was motivated by understanding the dangers of continuing such policies, and the perpetuation and intensification of sanctions that would result. Therefore, the theory that the Ayatollah made his most recent remarks to abort the talks defies logic.
Overconfidence
The last explanation is that Iranians are greatly overconfident and perceive that conditions are in their favor and that they can exploit the opportunity to impose their demands on the other side. Sobh-e Sadegh, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) publication, once explained the logic behind this stance as follows:
"The Iranian side ... has been able to create a necessary crack in the body of sanctions. The eagerness of economic centers to conduct business with Iran reveals that the crack is irreparable and it is highly unlikely, if not impossible to return to the past situation."
This sense of overconfidence also emanates from the widely popular perception among high echelon Iranians, including Iran's leader and former president and current chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , that Americans need a nuclear deal more than Iranians. The Iranians believe that they must take advantage of this opportunity and adopt a maximalist position to ensure that world powers reduce concessions to the bare minimum, if not altogether.
The world may learn whether this is a miscalculation within days.

KUWAIT CITY (AP) -- Thousands of people in Kuwait took part in a mass funeral procession Saturday for 27 people killed in a suicide bombing that targeted a Shiite mosque a day earlier.
Police in Kuwait said they are interrogating a number of suspects with possible links to the suicide bombing, which was claimed by an affiliate of the Islamic State group.

An Interior Ministry statement Saturday said police arrested the owner of the car that was used by the bomber to drive to the Imam Sadiq Mosque in Kuwait City, where he detonated his device inside among the worshippers. Police did not say how many suspects are being interrogated.
The bombing, which also wounded more than 200 male worshippers who were taking part in midday Friday prayers, was the first terrorist attack in Kuwait in more than two decades.
The government helped plan Saturday's mass funeral for those killed. Thousands of Sunnis and Shiites from across the country took part in the procession and prayer at Kuwait's Grand Mosque. Many carried the Kuwaiti flag; others a simple black flag to signify mourning. Some in the crowd chanted, "Sunnis and Shiites are brothers!"

Sunni groups in Kuwait and leaders from across the Middle East have strongly condemned the attack, which Gulf officials say is aimed at provoking a backlash from Shiites and sparking sectarian war. More than a third of Kuwait's 1.2 million citizens are believed to be Shiite. The majority of Kuwaitis are Sunni Muslims.
Kuwait's Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Sheikh Mohammed Al-Hamad Al-Sabah was quoted in the official Kuwait News Agency describing the bombing as "grotesque" and vowing to "cut the evil hand" that tampers with the country's security.
The news agency also carried a statement from Iraq's top Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, extending his condolences to the families of the victims.
