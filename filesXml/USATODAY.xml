Hundreds of thousands gather for pope Mass in Ecuador

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP)  Hundreds of thousands of people filled a park in Ecuador's main port city Monday for Pope Francis' first big event of his three-nation South American tour, hoping for a glimpse of Latin America's first pope returning to his home soil for a Mass dedicated to the family.
Many pilgrims spent the night outdoors, and some walked for miles to reach the park on Guayaquil's northern outskirts where the crowd sang hymns and sought pockets of shade to keep cool amid the scorching sun and high humidity. Firefighters sprayed them with water hoses to provide relief.
"I'm tired. I'm hungry, I haven't slept but I'm also full of emotion and joy in my heart," said Vicente Huilcatoma, a 47-year-old retired police officer who walked 25 miles to reach Samanes Park.
The Vatican had originally estimated more than 1 million people would turn out for the Mass, and government organizers put the crowd at above 1 million people in the hour before the service began. But Gabriel Almeida, the government spokesman at the scene, rolled back the estimate to several hundred thousand after officials viewed aerial images of the area.
Across the park, Ecuadoran national flags and papal banners waved above the enormous sea of people, who were divided into quadrants that Francis looped around slowly on his popemobile to cheers of "Francisco! Francisco!"
In his homily, Francis praised families as the bedrock of society  "the nearest hospital, the first school for the young, the best home for the elderly"  and said miracles are performed every day inside a family out of love. But he said sometimes the love and happiness runs out.
"How many women, sad and lonely, wonder when love left, when it slipped away from their lives?" he asked. "How many elderly people feel left out of family celebrations, cast aside and longing each day for a little love?"
Francis has dedicated the first two years of his pontificate to family issues, giving weekly catechism lessons on different aspects of family life and inviting the entire church to study ways to provide better pastoral care for Catholic families, people who are divorced, gays and families in "nontraditional" situations.
A preliminary meeting of bishops on these issues ended last year in bitter divisions between liberals and conservatives, particularly over ministering to gays and to Catholics who divorce and remarry outside of the church. Church teaching holds that Catholics who enter into a second marriage without having the first one annulled cannot receive Communion.
In his homily Monday, Francis said he hoped the second meeting of bishops on family life, scheduled for October, would come up with "concrete solutions to the many difficult and significant challenges facing families in our time."
"I ask you to pray fervently for this intention, so that Christ can take even what might seem to us impure, scandalous or threatening, and turn it ... into a miracle."
"Families today need miracles!" he added.
The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said Francis wasn't referring to the gay or divorce issue specifically but was making a more general reference that he hoped the bishops would "help the church chart this path of leaving a situation of sin to one of grace."
On his arrival in Guayaquil, the pontiff allowed several acolytes on the tarmac to take selfies with him. He then headed to the Shrine of the Divine Mercy, where 2,000 invitees gathered including child cancer patients, residents of homes for the elderly abandoned by their families and some of Guayaquil's poorest people.
He told those gathered that he would pray for them "and I won't charge you a thing. All I ask, please, is that you pray for me."
The crowd in Los Samanes park was festive, with young and old overjoyed at seeing the first pope in their lives.
"I'll ask the pope to intercede so that God gives me my health," said 90-year-old Guillermina Aveiga Davila, who arrived at dawn from the coastal city of Chone, some 300 kilometers  away. "I want to reach 100."
After the open-air Mass, a private lunch was planned with a group of Jesuits.
A highlight was to be a reunion with the Rev. Francisco Cortes, a priest affectionately known as "Padre Paquito," to whom the Argentina-born pope, then the Rev. Jorge Mario Bergoglio, entrusted his seminarians on study trips to Ecuador years ago.
In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Cortes couldn't fathom that Bergoglio remembered him, much less made a point of coming to have lunch.
"I don't know what to ask him," the soon-to-be 91-year-old Cortes said. "He said he wanted to see me and I'm amazed that he's coming. For the first time, I have known a pope.
The "pope of the poor" returned to Spanish-speaking South America for the first time as pontiff Sunday, stressing the importance of protecting the needy and the environment from exploitation and  in a nation whose president was booed as his vehicle followed the papal motorcade Sunday  to foster dialogue among all sectors of society. It's a message he's expected to repeat during his next stops in Bolivia and Paraguay, South America's two poorest countries.
Francis' only other trip back to Latin America since being elected pope was in 2013, when he visited Brazil, where Portuguese is the main language.
Francis' environmental message  from a pope who last month issued a treatise staking the Earth's preservation as a core mission for humanity  is particularly relevant for Ecuador, a Pacific nation that is home to one of the world's most species-diverse ecosystems but is also an OPEC country heavily dependent on oil. High crude prices allowed Correa to lift 1.3 million people out of poverty in his eight years in office.
But now that prices have fallen, the generous social safety net Correa has woven is threatened. He's had to cut government spending and been buffeted for nearly a month by the most serious anti-government street protests of his tenure.
Along Francis' motorcade route, the crowds alternated chants of adulation for the pontiff with jeers of "Correa out!" when the president's entourage followed.
Correa also has angered environmentalists and the nation's main indigenous group, CONAIE, by moving forward with oil drilling and mining projects in pristine Amazon forests.

PARIS (AP)  French authorities are investigating the theft of roughly 200 detonators plus grenades and plastic explosives from a military site in southeastern France, officials said Tuesday.
The thefts at the Miramas site, which is operated by a combination of military services west of Marseille, appeared to have occurred overnight from Sunday to Monday. The break-in comes as France has strengthened its security measures after two deadly attacks by extremists this year.
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said in a statement that an investigation has started on charges of "theft with break-in carried out by a criminal group" and "fraudulent entry into a military compound."
An official with the gendarmerie police force, which generally runs law enforcement in more rural areas of France, said the thief or thieves appeared to have cut through a fence to enter the high-security site. The official was not authorized to speak publicly because the operation is ongoing.
The Defense Ministry and a top spokesman for the French military did not immediately respond to calls and text messages from The Associated Press seeking details.
Mayor Frederic Vigouroux of Miramas told the AP he did not know precisely what was stolen, but said it was the first theft at the site. He said the outer fences were broken into, and that nine storehouses were affected.
"It wasn't cotton candy that was stolen," he said. "These are dangerous munitions. Everything is inherently dangerous."
France has been on its highest level of alert for terrorism following deadly attacks in January and June.
The base, about 200 hectares (500 acres), sits on the outskirts of the town of 30,000 and stocks munitions of the type used in French military operations in Mali and Afghanistan.

Britain marks 10th anniversary of London 7/7 bombings

LONDON   It's been a decade since Esther Hyman's sister, Miriam, was killed when four suicide bombers unleashed carnage on this city's public transportation system in the worst terrorist attack on British soil.
Miriam Hyman, 32, a picture researcher, was on her way to work on July 7, 2005, when the double-decker bus she was on exploded in Tavistock Square in central London. Three other bombs were detonated in underground stations by four Islamist terrorists during the morning rush hour.
The attacks  killed 52 people and injured nearly 800.
"As I said at her funeral, I can still remember when Miriam was in my mummy's tummy. She was born when I was just over 3 1/2, and I was very, very excited," Esther Hyman told USA TODAY. "She's an irreplaceable person in my life."
Tunisia: 8 suspected in hotel attack probe
Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron and Mayor of London Boris Johnson were  among those who laid wreaths at the memorial to the 52 victims in Hyde Park in the capital on Tuesday morning. The nation later observed a minute of silence. A national service took place at St. Paul's Cathedral and a separate service will be held at the Hyde Park memorial, attended by Prince William, survivors and the families of those killed.

This nation is also grieving the June 26 attack in the Tunisian resort city of Sousse that killed 38 people  30 of them Britons  when a militant opened fire on tourists at a beachfront hotel.
Prime Minister David Cameron announced Sunday that bank fines for infractions such as manipulating foreign exchange markets will cover the costs for a memorial to those killed in the Tunisia attack and another memorial for all Britons who have died in terrorist attacks overseas.
The 7/7 Tavistock Square Memorial Trust is raising funds for a separate memorial to honor the 13 people killed in the bus explosion.
"In their wicked madness the bombers presumably thought that they were doing something that would be a step toward creating a different city altogether," former government minister and aspiring London mayor Tessa Jowell said last week in delivering the fourth 7/7 Tavistock Square Memorial Trust Lecture.

"Perhaps they thought they could set the government against the people, race against race, non-Muslims against Muslims, eroding trust and understanding," she continued. "Of course, they failed, and they failed utterly."
Hyman said she pitied the terrorists behind such attacks. "These attacks are happening on a daily, weekly basis globally and my heart goes out to everyone who's involved in any of these kinds of incidents  not only the victims and the families of the victims and those injured, but even for the perpetrators," she said. "I pity them. That they are so damaged that they need to commit these acts."
She said the past decade had been spent "doing as much good work, positive work in Mim's memory as we can.  I feel that we're trying to do her proud."
Those works by the Miriam Hyman Memorial Trust include establishing the Miriam Hyman Children's Eyecare Center in India  Miriam was slightly nearsighted and appreciated the eye care she was given  and launching a website for teachers called Miriam's Vision: A Response to the 2005 London Bombings.
The website is aimed at supporting teachers in educating students about 7/7 and helping young people to develop life skills that will equip them to prevail in the face of adversity.
"As time has gone on, and I don't know if this is a personal truth or an absolute truth and it doesn't matter  but I feel that she finds lots of ways to let me know that she's still right here with me," Hyman said.
"She definitely finds ways to let me know she's around."

Taking strong climate action is a multitrillion dollar opportunity for better economic growth.
Recent trends in the global economy  such as the falling cost of clean energy, the spread of carbon pricing and the continuing volatility of oil prices  are building momentum for low-carbon growth and development.
To meet the goals of raising living standards, tackling poverty and reducing climate risk together, the scale and speed of change must accelerate, spurred on by cooperation both internationally and between the public and private sectors. With the help of international partnerships, it is possible through 10 key areas of action to generate better economic growth while achieving nearly all of the emissions reductions needed in the next 15 years to avoid dangerous climate change.
These partnerships go beyond just national governments to include cities and companies. They can stimulate growth by expanding markets, reducing costs, spreading best practices and alleviating concerns about international competitiveness.
What climate change deniers and believers share: Column
We can start by accelerating low-carbon development already underway in the world's cities. Almost 80 cities have already committed to reducing emissions through low-carbon development strategies and tracking their progress through the Compact of Mayors . Key measures such as investing in mass transit and making new buildings energy-efficient could cut emissions strongly while generating $17 trillion in savings by 2050. As an added bonus, making cities more compact, connected and coordinated can also improve quality of life by lowering pollution, congestion and traffic fatalities.
Governments can also lead by pricing carbon emissions. Forty countries and 20 sub-national governments have adopted or are planning carbon pricing , and 28 countries are undertaking energy subsidy reform.
Taking these measures reduces emissions and improves economic efficiency, while increasing the amount of government funds available for other priorities such as health, education and innovation.
Of course, governments cannot do it alone. The private sector must be committed as well  indeed, it is businesses that will likely provide most of the investment. Encouragingly, many businesses are already embracing the low-carbon economy, recognizing that it is better for growth and profitability than the high-carbon alternative. For instance, a group of more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have indicated that they are together saving $1.1 billion annually from emissions reduction initiatives. Major corporations responsible for more than 90% of the palm oil trade have committed to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains. And over 1,000 major companies and investors have explicitly signaled their support for carbon pricing.

Greek, other euro leaders set for new round of talks

Backed by Greek voters and opposition leaders, Prime Minister Alex Tsipras meets Tuesday with other eurozone leaders to see it they can resurrect debt relief negotiations.
Following Sunday's referendum in which 61% of voters rejected stringent bailout terms set by Greece's international creditors, Tsipras hoped to go to the meeting in Brussels with a strenghtened hand. On Monday, Greek party  leaders rallied around his call for new talks.
However, the lenders gave no immediate indication they were ready to compromise on new loans to keep Greece afloat.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who on Monday talked with Tsipras and met with French President Francois Hollande in Paris, stressed that Greece needs to take "responsibility" for reforming its economy. Hollande said Europe needs to show "solidarity" with Greece. The two leaders run the eurozone's largest economies.
Both leaders also said they respect the referendum results, and the door remains open to negotiations to find a way to keep Greece in the 19-country eurozone.
As the outlook for the talks remain unclear, the European Central Bank decided Monday to leave the level of emergency credit to Greek banks unchanged to prevent their collapse. But it raised its collateral requirements.
Banks have been closed for a week, with strict limits on daily ATM withdrawals, and are expected to stay shut at least through mid-week.
Tsipras wins at home, but debt problems remain
In one concession to the creditors, Tsipras replaced his outspoken finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, who had alienated eurozone leaders by assailing the onerous terms they demanded for new loans.
"I shall wear the creditors' loathing with pride," Varoufakis said in a defiant but characteristically colorful announcement about his resignation on his blog.
He said he was resigning because Tsipras believed his departure might help pave the way for Greece to "achieve a deal."
The Greek government later named lower-keyed economist Euclid Tsakalotos, 55, as the new finance minister. He was the prime minister's lead bailout negotiator in talks that halted last month before Tsipras called the referendum.

WASHINGTON  The U.S. military is making progress against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, but more work remains to be done, President Obama said Monday.
"This will not be quick  this is a long-term campaign," Obama said at the Pentagon after meeting top military brass in the wake of setbacks that have prompted critics to call for a more robust U.S. response against the Islamic State.
Obama and his military aides discussed "what's working, and what we can do better," the president said.
In his review of the campaign, Obama stressed that the United States is working with a 60-nation coalition, and that local forces must take the initiative. Military force alone will not "degrade" and "destroy" the Islamic State, he said, citing diplomatic and economic efforts that include efforts to cut off terrorists' money.
The United States and other countries must remain vigilant against "lone wolves" who might be inspired by the Islamic State to launch terrorist attacks, Obama said. That includes projects to counter an extremist ideology that seeks to attract adherents, including young Muslim men.
"Ideologies are not defeated with guns," Obama said. "They're defeated by better ideas, more attractive and more compelling vision."
He added: "We will never be at war with Islam while fighting terrorists who distort Islam and whose victims are mostly Muslims."

Not everyone was persuaded by the president's claims of progress.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz,, said the Islamic State continues to gain land in Iraq and Syria, and to expand its influence throughout the region. McCain said Obama's comments "reveal the disturbing degree of self-delusion that characterizes the Administration's campaign against ISIL."
The U.S.-led air war against the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, began last August after its fighters overran Mosul and seized tracts of land in Syria as well. It continues with daily airstrikes. The heart of the strategy, however, involves training and equipping local troops to battle ISIL.
The results have been dismal: Iraqi troops fled the provincial capital of Ramadi in May without a fight despite outnumbering ISIL by at least 10 to 1; a touted effort to train and equip Syrian moderates has had a stumbling start, with fewer than 100 having been vetted and receiving training.
McCain, who chairs the Armed Services Committee, has been a persistent critic of the strategy, saying that the deployment of additional trainers last month is "disconnected from any coherent strategy to defeat ISIL."
Obama's day: Islamic State update
He wants U.S. troops to deploy outside training bases with Iraqi troops to advise them in battle and to call in airstrikes. Military leaders have resisted deploying airstrike spotters, saying they will require a larger troop commitment than the spotters alone.
On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are scheduled to testify before McCain's committee on the Pentagon's counter-ISIL strategy. Last week, Dempsey described the strategy as building a network of local forces stretching from Africa to Afghanistan to address regional threats.
In Iraq, Carter pointed to the recent deployment of 450 U.S. troops to a base near Ramadi called Taqaddum. Troops there will train 500 Sunni fighters per month to take on ISIL, a Sunni-based movement. Overall, he noted that 10,500 Iraqi security forces have been advised and equipped by U.S. troops.
Risk outweighs reward in deploying airstrike spotters, officials say
Meanwhile, Obama also called on Senate Republicans to confirm a Treasury Department official responsible for blocking the flow of money to potential terrorists.
The Republican-run Senate has not even scheduled a hearing for Adam Szubin for undersecretary of the Treasury responsible for interdicting terrorist funds and sanctioning businesses and nations that supply the money, Obama said. If Congress was serious about helping, it would confirm Szubin.
Szubin would replace David Cohen, who is now deputy director of the CIA.

As the standoff between Greece and its international creditors continues, the only thing certain is that the country's financial situation will continue to worsen as each side sticks to its hard-line stance.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said Greeks made a "brave choice" Sunday in voting by more than 61% to reject harsh bailout conditions demanded by the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission (eurozone governments).
It's up to the creditors to decide whether to soften their demands or stick to their tough terms for massive new lending.
In the interim, Greece's five-year debt crisis appears to be going from bad to worse. The creditors' strategy "has been counterproductive," said Sean Egan, chief executive of Egan-Jones, a ratings firm.
"The hard line they have taken has resulted in a run on Greece's banks, a closing of its banks, a closing of the stock market and a paralysis of Greece's economy," Egan said. Last week, Greece missed a $1.8 billion loan repayment to the IMF.
Greece votes 'no': Now what?
In the wake of Greece's resounding "no" vote, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, leaders of the eurozone's two largest economies, conferred in Paris but were at odds about what to do next.
Both said they are open to negotiations with Greece. Merkel, Europe's leading advocate for austerity, stressed the importance of Greece taking "responsibility" for reforming its economy, while Hollande adopted a softer tone, saying Europe needs to show "solidarity" with Greece.
Tuesday, representatives of the 19-nation eurozone, where the euro is the official currency, will hold an emergency summit in Brussels to discuss the next steps. Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group, said the summit is likely to prove decisive for Greece's membership in the group.
Greek, other euro leaders set for new round of talks
Angelos Chryssogelos, an expert on Greek politics at the London-based think-tank Chatham House, said the strength of Sunday's mandate handed to Tsipras means it will be almost impossible for the prime minister's leftist Syriza party to make a deal with European creditors.
"The Europeans made it pretty clear where they stand, and they have been consistent," Chryssogelos said, adding that the creditors also are unlikely to back down. "Right now, voters across the eurozone largely support the tough stance taken by the eurozone."
Chryssogelos said Greek voters may have underestimated the resolve of the creditors to reach an accord on their terms. "If someone is seen getting preferential treatment, then someone else will want that treatment," he said, referring to other eurozone debtors such as Ireland and Portugal.
Kevin Featherstone, a professor of Greek studies and director of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said it remains in the interest of both sides to reach a compromise because the costs of concessions would be far less than a scenario that sees Greece ejected from the eurozone.
"We've had five years of strategic mistakes on both sides," Featherstone said. "What we now have is the epitome of those mistakes. In the next few days we're going to see who is going to blink first in this dramatic game of chicken."

But, who was the Dalai Lama before his celebrity debut on social media?
1. Named Dalai Lama at age 2.
Born on July 6, 1935, as Lhamo Dhondup, he lived with a barley-, buckwheat- and potato-farming family in Tibet. Leaders identified him as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama at age 2 and named him Tenzin Gyatso.
2. Entered the monastery at 6.
At age 6, he started studying the Buddhist philosophy as well as curriculum for his divine role. He learned 10 subjects, including Tibetan art and culture, medicine, monastic discipline canon, logic and metaphysics. He passed exams with honors at age 23, according to dalailama.com .
3. Fled Tibet after a Chinese invasion.
A Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1949 brought the then-15 year old to assume full power over Tibetan leadership in 1950. He attempted peace talks with Chinese leaders but was forced to escape into exile from the country in 1959. The night he left his country for India, he disguised himself as a common soldier to move through crowds unnoticed.
This is an undated photo of the future Dalai Lama of Tibetan Buddhism, born Lhamo Dhondrub on July 6, 1935, in the village of Takster in northeastern Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama was enthroned Feb. 22, 1940, and renamed Tenzin Gyatso.

PAMPLONA, Spain (AP)  Thousands of revelers doused each other with wine Monday to celebrate the start of the famed San Fermin running of the bulls festival in this northern Spanish city.
The festival started with the traditional launching of a fireworks rocket  known as the "Chupinazo" from the town hall balcony. The heaving crowd packed the square down below, jumping and screaming "Viva San Fermin!"
Most in the crowd waved red neckerchiefs, which along with white shirts and trousers form the traditional festival clothing.
The Chupinazo takes place a day before the first of eight 8 a.m. bull runs. Thousands of people at the festival test their speed and bravery by racing ahead of six fighting bulls along a 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city's bull ring. The bulls are then killed by professional matadors in bullfights each afternoon.

The nine-day, street-partying fiesta was immortalized in Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel The Sun Also Risesand attracts thousands of foreign tourists.
Bull runs, or "encierros," as they are called in Spanish, are a traditional part of summer festivals across Spain. Dozens are injured each year in the runs, most of them in falls.
Two men have died being gored by bulls in Spanish festivals in recent weeks  one Saturday in the eastern town of Grao de Castellon and another June 24 in the southwestern town of Coria.
Five Spaniards, two Australians and one American were gored in last year's festival in Pamplona. In all, 15 people have died from gorings in San Fermin since record-keeping began in 1924.
Check out images from last year's event:

We need to know: Did Saudis help fund 9/11 attacks? Column
James Bovard 2:16 p.m. EDT July 6, 2015
Classified 28 pages of 9/11 report need to be released.

Do Americans have the right to learn whether a foreign government helped finance the 9/11 attacks? A growing number of congressmen and senators are demanding that a 28-page portion of a 2002 congressional report finally be declassified. The Obama administration appears to be resisting, and the stakes are huge. What is contained in those pages  could radically change Americans' perspective of the War on Terror.
The congressional Joint Inquiry Into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001, completed its investigation in December 2002. But the Bush administration stonewalled the release of the 838-page report until mid-2003  after its invasion of Iraq was a fait accompli  and totally suppressed a key portion. Former senator Bob Graham, D-Fla., chairman of the investigation, declared that "there is compelling evidence in the 28 pages that one or more foreign governments was involved in assisting some of the hijackers in their preparation for 9/11." Graham later indicated that the Saudis were the guilty party. But disclosing Saudi links to 9/11 could have undermined efforts by some Bush administration officials to tie Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks.
Why we didn't close our beach: Opposing view
Suppressing the 28 pages was intensely controversial at the time. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the vice chairman of the joint inquiry, urged declassification of almost all of the 28 pages because "the American people are crying out to know more about who funds, aids and abets terrorist activities in the world." Forty-six senators , spearheaded by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and including almost all the Democratic members, signed a letter to President Bush urging the release of the 28 pages.
Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., revived the push to declassify those pages in 2013. Jones is a conservative stalwart best known for coining the phrase " freedom fries " in 2003 when France opposed  invading Iraq. He has since become one of the most outspoken opponents of reckless U.S. intervention abroad. Jones explained that he introduced a resolution because "the American people deserve the truth. Releasing these pages will enhance our national security, not harm it."
Last month, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., fresh from a bracing filibuster against the renewal of the Patriot Act, joined the 28-page fight.  Paul introduced the Transparency for the Families of 9/11 Victims and Survivors Act , co-sponsored by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.  The suppressed pages are another wedge between Paul and other Republican presidential candidates; New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie rejects declassification, instead urging deference to the president's judgment on the issue.
Members of Congress can read the still-classified pages in a special secure room on Capitol Hill if they get prior permission from the House or Senate Intelligence Committee.
When sharks attack and beaches stay open: Our view
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., one of the few members to go read the report, was shocked : "I had to stop every couple of pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that. It challenges you to rethink everything." Massie is one of 18 co-sponsors ofJones' resolution in the House.
Why is the Obama administration continuing to suppress a report completed more than a dozen years ago?  It is not as if the White House's credibility would be damaged by revelations of Saudi bankrolling the worst attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor ( 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis).
And it is not as if the Saudis became squeaky-clean Boy Scouts after 9/11.  Saudi sources are widely reported to be bankrolling Islamic State terrorists throughout the Middle East; Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate committee last September that "I know major Arab allies who fund" ISIS.
President Obama just ordered more U.S. troops to Iraq to seek to rebuff the ISIS onslaught.  If the Saudis are helping sow fresh chaos in the Middle East, that is another reason to disclose their role in an attack that helped launch conflicts that have already cost thousands of American lives and more than $1.6 trillion , according to the Congressional Research Service.
"Don't confuse me with the facts" should not be the motto of the War on Terror. Self-government is an illusion if politicians can shroud the most important details driving federal policy.  If Americans have learned anything since 9/11, it should be the folly of deferring to Washington secrecy.

After Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called for yesterday's vote on whether Greece should accept the austerity measures its creditors are demanding, the international reaction was nearly universally negative, with the leftist Greek leader accused of engaging in demagoguery at the expense of his nation. The criticism has even made its way to Urban Dictionary:
Greek Referendum
Noun. An act of intense self-destruction. A suicidal act. Usually harms many people, not just the person committing the act. Often causes those witnessing the act to facepalm or exclaim in a loud voice, "Why?"
The average Greek citizen is not a political economist or an expert in international finance, which means most eligible voters weren't nearly knowledgeable enough on the technical financial issues involved to make an informed decision  certainly not as informed as the government they elected to make these decisions. Nevertheless, the mere fact that Greek citizens were given a choice means that the Greek referendum might actually be good for the country in the long run.
Pick your poison
Going into the vote, Greece faced two very bad options. On the one hand, it could turn down Europe's bailout proposal, reject the attached austerity measures, and face the wrath of its creditors. This would destroy Greece's credit rating for years and probably lead to the country's exit from the European Union, which would in all likelihood trigger massive capital flight, inflation, and all sorts of other economic horrors. On the other hand, Prime Minister Tsipras and his team could accept yet another round of unpopular austerity measures, further cutting salaries and pensions and raising taxes, under the hope that this austerity package (unlike the last several) would finally lead to an improvement in the Greek economy. But with unemployment already at record highs, this would put severe financial strain on Greek families, and potentially cause the economy to collapse further.
In other words, it didn't matter which decision the Greeks made; the ramifications were going to be pretty bad. It was pick-your-poison time.
The biggest threat
One might say that the biggest threat to Greece right now, however, wasn't austerity, nor is it the now very real possibility of leaving the Euro. The biggest threat to Greece right now may be the political instability that could result from citizens' frustrations regarding the inevitable fallout from either of those two unenviable paths. Disruptive protests, rioting, constitutional change, or (at worst) an unconstitutional change in government or regime would only make Greece's economic situation worseand could have ripple effects on every aspect of Greek life for years to come.
The people's say
So how does the government in Athens prevent unrest? Bringing its citizens into the decision-making process may make them more likely to accept the ultimate outcome, whatever that outcome may be. As we discussed in our book, Democracy Despite Itself, there is a strong psychological principle that people are much more at peace with a decision  even one they disagree with  if they are given a voice in the decision-making process. This so-called "procedural justice" also reduces corruption and makes people more willing to follow rules and get along.
Research captures these effects. During the 1991 California drought, the amount of water residents rationed wasn't influenced by their beliefs about the drought's severity, but instead was driven by how fair they thought water pricing and allocating polices were. Studies show that people are more likely to pay taxes when they get to vote on where the tax money goes, even when they aren't on the winning side of the vote.
The referendum result isn't likely to help Greece make better decisions about its future,  but it very well could help Greece nonetheless. The mere fact that the voters themselves are deciding could make all the difference in the world.

ATHENS  The  unexpectedly strong "no" vote Greeks cast against a new international bailout plan was a great political victory for Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. Yet his personal triumph may soon be overshadowed by a worsening financial crisis.
"Nothing changes," said Elena Roumba, 35, an unemployed Athens resident, echoing the sentiment of many in Greece and around Europe. "The crisis remains."
Indeed, Sunday's vote does not change the economic crisis the country faces: banks are nearly out of money, and unless international creditors agree to soften their terms for new loans, Greece remains on the verge of financial collapse.
Analysis: Greece's 'game of chicken' with creditors continues
Some political analysts say the mandate from voters will strengthen the hand of Tsipras and his left wing Syriza party to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and European Commission for debt relief with less severe demands for spending cuts.
And by taking a tough stand against unpopular austerity measures as the price for a bailout, Tsipras appears stronger at home, too, since taking office early this year.
On Monday, opposition party leaders rallied around Tsipras in pursuing new bailout negotiations.
"We have a man who has won two electoral battles in six months. Such a man should feel very happy," said Christos Xanthakis, a political analyst in Athens and columnist at the news website newspost.gr.
"Each time he was publicly addressing Greeks, the 'no' vote gained ground," Xanthakis added. "This clearly suggests that his personal image has not been damaged at all but on the contrary, it has been strengthened."
Still, other analysts say, Greece's rapidly deteriorating financial situation could threaten his political future and trigger elections in the not so-distant future.
"The disaster will begin," said Dimitris Charlambis, professor of political science at the University of Athens. "Greece will face a banking crisisdevaluation and hyperinflationthen default."
Since 2010, Greece has borrowed $266 billion, the biggest loan given to a country in history. Despite austerity policies adopted by the government, Greece's public debt has risen to nearly double its annual economic activity and unemployment has skyrocketed to 26%.
Tsipras, who sacked his brash finance minister, Yianis Varoufakis, on Monday, said last week after calling for the referendum that creditors are now offering a "decent" deal to Greece. But some believe he and his government miscalculated.
Greek, other euro leaders set for new round of talks
"Tsipras has overplayed his hand," said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING financial group's Frankfurt office. "The Euro group is so fed up with his political style and the damage it has caused. They have lost trust in the current Greek government."
At the same time, Greek voters, weary after so many years in economic distress, have lost trust in the creditors' ever-demanding calls for more austerity.
Voters elected Tsipras' fringe party into the mainstream in January because they were fed up with the establishment parties that ran Greece for decades and agreed to the tough measures imposed by the creditors.
"I will give Mr. Tsipras the power to negotiate for our better future," said Kostas Petratos, 20, a mathematics student in Patras in western Greece. "This situation was created by the previous prime ministers. Mr. Tsipras is fighting and I will fight with him."
After the vote results were announced Sunday, thousands of  "no" supporters gathered at Athens' main Syntagma Square and erupted in cheers and song to celebrate their victory.
For the moment, no one here was thinking about the government's uncertain future or their own.
