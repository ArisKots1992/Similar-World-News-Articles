Irish vessel L Eithne has carried out its second rescue of hundreds of migrants in less than 24 hours.
The Naval Service flagship rescued 300 migrants in the Mediterranean, 45km north of Libya , on Friday morning.
Ireland faces decision over EU migration relocation policy
At 8am on Thursday morning, the Irish flagship received an alert there were five vessels in potential distress about 60km off the coast of the North African state and rescued 201 migrants.
Minister for Defence Simon Coveney said the continued efforts of the L Eithne to help the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean was commendable.
This second rescue coming immediately after handing over rescued migrants from yesterdays operation reflects the commitment and professionalism of the ships crew, he said.
The Italian Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre alerted the Irish vessel at 4am, Friday, the migrants were on board a barge that was trying to cross the south central Mediterranean.
L Eithne set sail immediately to help the men, women and children in trouble.
Mr Coveney confirmed the 300 migrants were taken on board the ship, which was waiting on further instructions from the Italian co-ordination centre.
Of the 300 migrants rescued, 217 were men, 35 were women and 48 were children, according to a statement from the Irish Defence Forces.
Fridays rescue was only the second time the L Eithne has been involved in a rescue operation of migrants in the Mediterranean.

Jack is back for the eighth year running as the most popular name chosen for baby boys born in 2014 while Emily has again topped the table as Irelands most popular girls name.
The top five boys names last year were Jack, James, Daniel, Conor and Sean which, in varying order, have been the most popular boys names since 2007 data released today by the Central Statistics Office shows.
There were, however, some regional variations., Adam was the most popular boys name in Cavan , Michael topped the chart in Longford while Oisin and James were most popular in Donegal .
Four new boys names - Henry, Hugo, Ollie and Luca - made the top 100 rank for boys for the first time last year while the girls names Annie and Isla broke into the top-100 last year.
After Emily the names Sophie, Emma, Grace and Ava proved the next most popular names for girls among Irish parents.
As in previous years, the tables show that girls are given a wider variety of names than boys with 4,586 girls names registered compared to 3,486 boys names.
For the first time the CSO have also provided an analysis of the top ten most popular surnames of babies registered in 2014.
Of the 67,462 live births registered in 2014 here were 22,090 unique surnames with the top-10 most popular surnames accounting for over 5,000 babies born last year.
Murphy was the given surname for over 1.1 per cent of babies born last year while Kelly made up 0.9 per cent or 633 births.

A care centre for adults with intellectual disabilities in Cork remains unsuitable to meet the needs of its residents, according to a Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) report.
An inspection of the Grove House centre found many areas were unclean, paintwork was damaged and surfaces of some equipment was also damaged.
There were fire safety concerns too with fire exits being locked while not all members of staff had adequate safety knowledge.
The report said since the last inspection in March there were some improvements made to the centre, however, due to the institutional design and layout of the premises, it was not suitable to meet the aims and objectives of the service and the needs of the residents.
The findings of the inspection revealed an inadequate level of compliance with the Health Act 2007.

Garda arrested in media disclosure case released
File being prepared for Director of Public Prosecutions after senior officer held
A report from the former childrens ombudsman Emily Logan said  information leaked to the media about a case involving two Roma families more than likely came from a member of the Garda.

The senior Garda arrested over his alleged dealings with the media when members of the force took two Roma children from their families has been released from custody.
A Garda spokesman said the officer had been released without charge and a file is being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.
The former Ombudsman for Children Emily Logan in a report published last July concluded information about one of two children taken from their homes in October 2013 in Westmeath and Dublin had on the balance of probability been disclosed by a member of the Garda to the journalist who wrote the initial reports on the first child being taken.
Garda arrested over alleged media role in Roma children case
It went on to say that all parties involved in the case regarded this development as deeply troubling and highly regrettable.
The information reported did not lead to the children being taken. Instead, it confirmed the Garda had taken them, with the event becoming a major embarrassment to the force.
While she did not recommend a criminal investigation, Garda Commissioner Noirin OSullivan was quick to establish an inquiry.
That inquiry identified a senior officer based in Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin, as a suspect and it is he who was arrested at 7.30am on Thursday. He went to a Garda station in Dublin by arrangement.
The two Roma children were taken from their families by the Garda in October 2013 and briefly held in the care of the HSE before being returned when DNA evidence established the familial link.

Government objections blamed for delay in public pay talks

Last-minute objections by elements within the Government are being blamed for delays in finalising a new deal on pay restoration for about 300,000 staff in the public service.
Talks between Government representatives and trade unions were adjourned shortly after 2.00 am and will reconvene later on Friday.
Highly- placed sources said a draft two-year extension to the existing Haddington Road accord had been put together by Thursday afternoon but was never formally tabled after concerns were raised by some figures within the Government to the carry-over cost of the proposed new pay arrangements into 2018.
Government wants unions to re-affirm commitments on disputes
Under the proposed deal staff would receive a 1,000 boost in earnings in 2016 to be achieved by means of an adjustment of the thresholds of the public service pension levy.
This additional money would be received by staff in their pay cheques throughout the year rather than in a lump sum so that by the end of 2016 they would be 1,000 better off in total.
For some lower-paid personnel, special pay increases of between 1 and 2 per cent would be applied so as to allow them to also receive a 1,000 increase in earnings next year.
It was envisaged under the draft deal that in 2017 there would be further adjustments to the pension levy so as those earning less than 65,000 would receive a further 1,000.
Higher paid staff would benefit from pay restoration proposals set out originally in the Haddington Road deal.
Highly-placed sources said the cost of these proposals would come in within the financial parameters set down by the Government for any pay restoration deal of between 250 million and 300 million per year.
Last-minute
However sources maintained there were last-minute concerns raised by some figures within the Government about the roll-over cost of the proposed measures in subsequent years.
Some participants in the process maintained last night they had effectively been left in limbo for 8 hours as a result of the last minute hitch in the proceedings. One person close to the process described the mood last night prior to the adjournment as sour.
The talks, which were being assisted by the Labour Relations Commission , have been adjourned until 10.00am on Friday.
In addition to the pay proposals, the draft deal also contained a number of other elements.
Under one key proposal, it is understood new restrictions would be put in place on any new outsourcing initiative in the public service . Sources said that, under the proposal, labour costs would have to be excluded from any cost-benefit analysis of the outsourcing of any service. This issue has been a priority for Siptu.
In return for pay restoration, trade unions representing staff in the public service would be obliged to reaffirm commitments to solve disputes by peaceful means through binding arbitration.
Government sources have argued there had been some slippage in relation to industrial relations peace in the public service in recent times.
A senior Government source on Thursday night told The Irish Times the draft agreement involved a recommitment to and extension of the Haddington Road flexibilities and a strengthening of the mechanisms designed to facilitate change and reform the public service.
The relationship between pay and reform has been established and will not be broken, the source said.
The Government gave a commitment last year that it would begin the unwinding of financial emergency legislation that underpinned various cuts in public service pay and pensions introduced since 2009.

More than 100 million for refurbishing housing
Half the money will go to adapting housing to fit it out for older and disabled people
Homes built for older people in Gorey, Co Wexford

First published: Fri, May 29, 2015, 01:00
More than 100 million is to be spent on refurbishing empty social housing and adapting private homes for older and disabled people.
Most of the money, 91 million has been allocated by the Department of the Environment, with 10 million from local authority grants and the local property tax (LPT).
More than 1,000 vacant local authority flats and houses will be refurbished for people on the social housing waiting list at a cost of over 20 million. Dublin city and Cork city will receive the largest allocations, at just under 4.4 million and more than 3.6 million respectively. Priority for these homes will be given families facing homelessness.
Half of all the funding, 50 million, will be available for adapting private houses for older or disabled people. The money can be used to build extensions or for the adaptation or homes to improve mobility, through installing stair lifts or access ramps. Half of that funding will come from the exchequer and the remaining money from local authorities. Most of the local authority money, just over 15 million, will come from property tax receipts.
A further 11 million will be made available for local authority house adaptations and extensions to meet the needs of tenants with a disability and to deal with overcrowding.
The remaining 20 million will be used to improve local authority flats and houses to make them more energy efficient. Property tax will fund just under 2 million of this work.

As many as 15,000 holders of standard variable-rate (SVR) mortgages could see their repayments fall by more than 1,000 a year simply by switching provider, the governor of the Central Bank has claimed.
Patrick Honohan said Irish banks knew there was inertia on the part of borrowers who could switch. This had lessened any imperative for them to aggressively compete in the market by lowering their rates to gain and retain market share.
Mr Honohan told the Oireachtas finance committee that the Central Bank had in recent weeks looked through figures provided to them by the States banks and found that there were up to 15,000 people who, if they had the time to get out and do the sums, could save a four-figure sum in a year.
If people were more active in the switching market, it might keep banks on their toes and we would encourage that.
While Mr Honohan said he would welcome interest rate cuts for SVR mortgage holders, he warned against any Government intervention that would force banks to lower their rates, saying such a move would damage the economy.
He had a firm conviction that the administrative control of interest rates would be bad for the country as a whole. In the medium term there could be a case for Government intervention. Such intervention would have a stultifying effect on bank efficiency and a chilling effect on bank competition, he added.
Competition, he said, was borrowers main protection against banks inflating the interest rates. He said the level of competition in the banking sector at present was too low.
Mr Honohan was challenged by Fianna Fils Sen Fleming about his reliance on the god of competition to protect borrowers from excessively high SVR mortgages. He reminded Mr Honohan that competition from overseas banks sparked a rate-price war that fuelled the boom and deepened the bust.
Mr Honohan conceded the point and said he wanted to get back to a situation where there were five or six players who are competitors. He added that you can have too much competition as well as too little.
People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett also challenged Mr Honohan on his
faith in competition to make the mortgage market fair.
Control of retail interest rates is a kind of Rubicon, Mr Boyd Barrett said. It has a signalling value far in excess of what you might think.
In reference to the recently introduced mortgage lending rules aimed at cooling the market, Mr Honohan said he was not dissatisfied with subsequent developments.
CSO figures for April show prices nationally rose by 0.6 per cent and are now 15.8 per cent higher than a year ago.
In Dublin, prices increased by 1 per cent last month, reflecting an annual inflation rate at 20.2 per cent.

Staff in public service appear to be set for an increase in earnings of about 1,000 next year under a proposed pay restoration deal between the Government and trade unions.
A pay rise in 2017 has also been considered as part of an overall two-year extension to the existing Haddington Road agreement.
The increase in earnings next year would come from changes in the application of the public service pension levy, which was introduced in 2009 and averaged at about 7.5 per cent.
Government wants unions to re-affirm commitments on disputes
As some low-paid workers would not benefit proportionately from this mechanism, they may receive a top -up pay rise next year.
An overall deal would also involve increases for public service pensioners who faced cuts during the years of economic crisis.
Any boost for public service staff earnings that might be agreed for a second year is likely to come from an increase in pay rates rather than further changes to the pension levy.
Talks on an overall public service pay restoration agreement were continuing last night and informed sources said that at that stage no formal pay offer had been presented to the parties.
A wide range of other non-pay issues had been addressed as part of the talks, which had been under way for the last fortnight.

Labour costs
Under one key proposal, it is understood new restrictions will be put in place on any new outsourcing initiative. Sources said that, under the proposal, labour costs would have to be excluded from any cost-benefit analysis of the outsourcing of any service. This issue has been a priority for Siptu.

In return for pay restoration, trade unions representing staff in the public service would be obliged to reaffirm commitments to solve disputes by peaceful means through binding arbitration.
Government sources have argued there had been some slippage in relation to industrial relations peace in the public service in recent times.

Flexibilities
A senior Government source last night told The Irish Times the draft agreement involved a recommitment to and extension of the Haddington Road flexibilities and a strengthening of the mechanisms designed to facilitate change and reform the public service.

The relationship between pay and reform has been established and will not be broken.
The Government gave a commitment last year that it would begin the unwinding of financial emergency legislation that underpinned various cuts in public service pay and pensions introduced since 2009.
Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin indicated over recent weeks that his priority in the pay restoration talks would be to assist those on low pay.
Trade unions had argued that this could best be achieved by means of a flat-rate increase  secured by changing the application of the pension levy  rather than through a percentage-based rise, which would give greater benefit to the better-off.
The talks on public service pay restoration, which have been under way since May 11th, are being facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission .
Any outcome of the talks would have to be put out to ballot by trade unions and other bodies representing about 300,000 staff across the public service.

The Irish Open attendance figures are predicted to be off the charts at Newcastle. As dogged golf fans ignored the squalling showers that swept over Slieve Donard and across Royal County Down, officials were expecting more than 90,000 to arrive during the week.
That figure could have been more, according to Tourism Northern Ireland , as the organisers restricted numbers to maintain spectator comfort and to protect the sand dunes out of which the natural golf course has been sculpted.
The figures may be slightly more than that but its capped every day at around 20,000 because of keeping the integrity of the course and to ensure the visitor experience is protected, said Kathryn Thomson of Tourism Northern Ireland.
Benefactors dig deep for chance to play with worlds number one
Even at the pro-am, a celebrity-driven event that takes place before the four-day competition begins, 11,000 visitors came through the gate. The Irish Open has not had that many fans attend a pro-am before. In 2012 when it was held up the coast at Royal Portrush, the pro-am attracted 10,000 visitors. Usually the attendance would be closer to half that.
Ticket sales
The percentage of ticket sales to people from outside Northern Ireland is also higher than in 2012, when it was 15 per cent. This year more than 30 per cent came from outside the North, with 28 per cent from the Republic.

Yes, its partly the Rory [McIlroy] factor but also we had some of our local celebrities playing, said Thomson .  James Nesbitt [actor] was playing. Paddy Kielty [comedian] was playing as well as some sports personalities such as Australian cricketer Shane Warne , AP McCoy [jockey], Pat Jennings [football] and Dennis Taylor [snooker].
McIlroy was the star attraction yesterday and brought people in, although playing partner Rickie Fowler also drew his fair share of admirers. McIlroy and Fowler are the rocknroll kids of the game, but the first day was more Rickie rockin and Rory rolling over.
The fans stuck with McIlroy as he struggled with his game. Around some of the amphitheatre-shaped greens, hundreds spread across the dunes, squatting in the sheltered sides, out of the driving rain.
Come on, Rickie, its not California ,  shouted a female fan at the tanned Fowler after a gale almost swept him off the rise at the second tee box.
Oh my god, sighed another from among the huge gallery as McIlroys score, one of the worst of the day, loomed into view at the 17th hole. It was blue, a bad colour in golf; eight over par is an even worse number in golf.
By the end, those fans were both sympathetic and stunned. McIlroy hit four bogeys from the 15th hole before bringing his first day to a close with a wretched 80.
But the Ulster fans again proved themselves to be among the most enthusiastic in Europe . It is only the second time in European Tour history an event has sold out in advance. The first was in Royal Portrush two years' ago.

Patrick Neary tells  inquiry regulatory system  did not work
Former regulator apologises for insufficient measures and inability to deal with crisis
Fri, May 29, 2015, 01:00
First published: Fri, May 29, 2015, 01:00
Former financial regulator Patrick Neary has told the Oireachtas banking inquiry he had bought into a system of regulation that didnt work .
In his evidence to the committee on Thursday, Mr Neary said that, with hindsight, the supervisory measures taken by the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (IFSRA) were not sufficient to meet the challenges posed by the crisis and the recession that emerged.
I am deeply sorry about that, he said. I regret that very deeply.
Passing the buck
He was questioned about his time as chief executive of IFSRA between February 2006 and January 2009 by committee members including Fine Gael TD Kieran ODonnell.
It was a period where I bought into a system of regulation that didnt work. The system failed and I regret that, he said.
Mr Neary said that the IFSRA relied on the banks for analysis of risk management, believing them to be best placed to know their own business.
He was asked by committee chairman Ciarn Lynch of Labour if the fact that the banks were four times the size of the Irish economy had not been a matter of concern.
The warnings that were coming from the Central Bank certainly did not create a concern that actions needed to be taken. They were benign and the conclusion was that we had a soft landing, Mr Neary replied.
He said commentaries from other bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and OECD backed up this view.
Professional
However, when accused of having an extremely cosy relationship with the banks by Socialist TD Joe Higgins , Mr Neary said he really did not know what that meant. He said there was dialogue and a professional relationship but he would not go any further than that to describe the relationship.
Mr Neary said he regretted not keeping a minute of an informal meeting he had with then Anglo Irish Bank chief executive David Drumm in September 2007, which he accepted had turned out to be very important.
Under questioning from Fianna Fil finance spokesman Michael McGrath, he said Mr Drumm came to him suggesting there were rumours that businessman Sen Quinn was active in the CFD [contracts for difference market].
Mr Neary said he tried to make some inquiries but nobody had anything hard and fast about Mr Quinn and his CFDs. He said the facts were established on Good Friday in March 2008.
In January 2008, he met Mr Quinn, who volunteered that he had some CFDs.
I took him to mean that whatever CFDs he had in financial stock, that he had converted it into a holding and shares, Mr Neary said.
Golfballs
Labour Senator Susan OKeeffe raised the production of golfballs featuring the logo of the financial regulator.
Mr Neary said when he became aware of the branded golf balls, meant to be used as promotional materials, they were discontinued.
It was a mistake. There were a very small number of them purchased and it was discontinued very quickly, he said.
When it was unearthed it was discontinued. I regret that. It shouldnt have happened.
He was also questioned by Sinn Fin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty , who asked Mr Neary why he did nothing despite knowing Anglo and Irish Nationwide were lending to a very small number of individuals.
Mr Neary said he could not conceive of a situation where the regulator would intervene in a relationship between bankers and clients.
It is inconceivable that the regulator can determine who or who doesnt get a credit from a bank as a customer of that bank.
Mr Doherty asked again: Why did you do nothing?

Fine Gael Senator Pat ONeill said the sale of the Governments Aer Lingus share was right for the airline and the country.
We are a small island nation and connectivity to mainland Europe , the UK and the US is one of the most important things we have, he said.
Dil backs sale of State stake in  Aer Lingus
Mr ONeill said commitments had been given by IAG on connectivity and the Heathrow slots.
Independent Senator Feargal Quinn said he had always felt a particular pride when he saw the Aer Lingus shamrock logo on an aircraft on the runway in a foreign airport. The danger of losing that is something none of us wants.
Mr Quinn said he was inclined to support the objective of the deal, having weighed up all the pros and cons. It seems to be the best deal we can get, he added.
Independent Senator David Norris said Ireland should have an independent, stand-alone and State-owned airline. When the Fianna Fil government denationalised Aer Lingus, I spoke and voted against that, he added.
Mr Norris said some of the money from the sale should be set aside to resolve the disgraceful situation whereby deferred Aer Lingus pensioners had been squeezed out of their rightful entitlements.
Kathryn Reilly , of Sinn Fin, said the sale was wrong for Ireland: Aer Lingus is worth infinitely more to Ireland than the 335 million the Government will get for cashing in on the 25 per cent stake that Fianna Fil left the State with.

Aylward and Power moves suggest FF renewal losing steam
Hard for Fianna Fil  to escape image  its new politics is  identical to its old approach

First published: Fri, May 29, 2015, 01:00

Two events over the course of the week have suggested Fianna Fils renewal drive is beginning to lose steam: the election of a member of the old guard, Bobby Aylward , in the Carlow-Kilkenny byelection, and the abrupt departure of Senator Averil Power - the partys poster-figure for youth and advancement of women politicians.
That impression may well have been reinforced by the five selection conventions the party held over the past two nights, where former TDs ( John Curran in Dublin Mid West; Martin Mansergh in Tipperary and Charlie OConnor in Dublin South West) all threw their hats into the ring.
It has made it hard for the party to escape the image that its new politics is more or less identical to its old approach.
Fianna Fils Bobby Aylward returns to Leinster House
Humiliating loss
While Fianna Fil suffered a debilitating and humiliating loss in the 2011 general election, it is not - in reality - possible for a political party to effect a scorched earth approach to renewing itself, because it will often result in the eclipse of its remaining supporters who stood behind the party through thick and thin.
Fine Gael found itself in a roughly similar position in 2002 (although the scale of its collapse was more modest).
One of its big achievements was to bring a raft of new candidates forward ( Leo Varadkar and Lucinda Creighton were the most prominent).
However, it must also be remembered that many of the gains Fine Gael made in 2007 were seats gained by seasoned TDs who had lost out in 2002, including Alan Shatter , Charlie Flanagan , Michael Creed , and Brian Hayes .
Sen Barrett, then in his 60s, also returned to the Dil in 2007 after a long absence.
The reality is, as a seasoned political commentator said on Thursday, a party needs to put its best team on the field. You just cant put out the under-21s.
Cork North West TD for Fianna Fil Michael Moynihan says Fianna Fil will comfortably surpass the new electoral rule that holds that 30 per cent of its candidates will be women.
The party has also pointed out that while the returning veterans have grabbed most media attention, the party will be fielding more new (and young) candidates than at any time since its foundation.
A cursory glance through the 40 constituencies illustrates that mix.
In Mayo for example, Lisa Chambers will be Dara Callearys running mate. In Galway West , where the convention was held on Thursday night, the party pursued a one-male, one female candidate strategy, with Mary Hoade the favourite to join incumbent amon  Cuv.
The modernising one-member one-vote system will favour more established politicians. Like other parties, Fianna Fil is likely to add candidates onto the ticket to achieve balance on gender and age.
Other veterans who may return include Pat the Cope Gallagher in Donegal and Mary Hanafin in Dn Laoghaire .
Referendum campaign
It is less likely that Pat Carey will return in Dublin North West, but given his significant part in the Yes Equality referendum campaign, the party would welcome him back with open arms. All of them would have biddable chances of winning seats.
But there is a raft of young candidates, with the chance that enough will get through to reinvigorate the party - as the likes as Varadkar and Creighton did for Fine Gael.
In Cork South West the three leading candidates are all women - Gillian Coughlan , Margaret Murphy OMahony and Deirdre Kelly .
In Kerry, highly regarded Waterville councillor Norma Moriarty will join John Brassil on the ticket.
In Tipperary, Siobhn Ambrose has been mentioned as a candidate, and in Waterford Mary Butler was the front-runner to have won the selection convention on Thursday.
In Dublin, Catherine Ardagh is likely to be selected as the candidate in Dublin South Central, while Laura Reid may be in the mix in Dublin North West.
With Averil Powers departure, Deirdre Heney is likely to join Sean Haughey on the ticket in Dublin Bay North.
Other young candidates (and prospective candidates) include James Lawless in Kildare North ; Aaron OSullivan in Cork East ; Jack Chambers in Dublin West ; Malcolm Byrne in Wexford , and Cormac Devlin , who might come through the gap in the highly competitive Dn Laoghaire convention.
Three very high-profile women candidates - Mary Hanafin, Kate Feeney and Lisa Chambers - have also been mentioned for this constituency.

Dil backs sale of State stake in  Aer Lingus

The Dil has approved the sale of the States stake in Aer Lingus to International Airlines Group (IAG) following an ill-tempered two-day debate.
The motion was passed by 74 votes to 51.
Labour TD Michael McNamara was the only Coalition deputy to vote against the motion. He told the Dil that while much had been done to meet his concerns, there were outstanding issues.
Ryanair shareholders seek answers on Aer Lingus
There are questions I have . . . questions unanswered, and, in that context, I am not prepared to gamble with what I believe is the key to the economic development of all of this State.
Mr McNamara said next year would mark the centenary of the Rising and there would be talk of developing all of the country equally.
The Clare TD said one of the key factors in attracting US companies to Shannon was its connectivity to the US.
Driver of growth
Shannon Airport was established to be the driver of growth in the midwest and it had achieved that up to the time Fianna Fil in its wisdom decided to abandon it in favour of Dublin.
Nevertheless, for a long period in its history it was the driver of growth in the midwest and it is again, largely because of decisions this Government has taken and which I have supported.
Mr McNamara said while the protections in the sale agreement were welcome, those around the Dil a lot longer than him would recall that a similar golden or B share scenario was put in place to give the government a veto over the sale of the sugar division when Greencore was privatised.
A few years later doubts were cast on that agreement in a European Court of Justice ruling.
Key role
Dublin North Labour TD Brendan Ryan said that, with party colleagues, he had played a key role in ensuring the initial offer from IAG was unacceptable to the Government.
Once a bid was made for Aer Lingus, we had to respond to the world as it was, not the world Sinn Fin or the far left pretended it was.
Mr Ryan said Aer Lingus was not a commercial semi-State company like the ESB and Ervia. It is a private company with shareholders, of which the State is one. The company has always been subject to a takeover bid.
He said under the deal the Minister for Finance would have the ability to block any proposed disposal by Aer Lingus of any of its Heathrow slots indefinitely.
This provides stronger protection for the State than the current arrangement, under which the State cannot prevent a reallocation, reassignment or cessation of use of the Heathrow airport slots.
He said the Minister would also be able to block a proposal by Aer Lingus to change its company name, brand and head office location and place of incorporation from Ireland .
This commitment is unlimited in time and provides protection that, again, is not available under the current arrangement.

Subsidised fees for after-school care being considered
Coalition mulls  childcare cost measures with lower income groups paying less
Minister for Children James Reilly has established a group to examine the issue of childcare, and it is due to issue its final report by the end of June. File photograph: Frank Perry/AFP/Getty Images

Parents would pay subsidised fees for after-school care for children, with those in lower income groups paying less, under measures being considered by the Coalition to address childcare costs.
Minister for Children James Reilly has established a group to examine the issue of childcare, and it is due to issue its final report by the end of June.
An after-school programme exists for low income and unemployed parents, with the State contributing 40 for each child, with a maximum fee of 15 a week payable by parents.
Sources said this may be widened to take in parents in other income groups, although contributions would rise for those earning more.
Safety standards
A draft copy of the groups report, seen by The Irish Times, cites the example of New Zealand , where subsidies are provided for children attending services that meet certain safety and quality standards.
The New Zealand model sees care programmes open from 7am to 8.30am before school, as well as running until 5.30pm after school.
Programmes are also in place during holidays.
The draft reports other recommendations include paid paternity leave, and extending periods of shared parental leave to as much as a year, which would be phased in over a number of years.
While a childcare tax credit was considered, and favoured by many parents surveyed by the group, it would involve a substantial cost to the exchequer, upwards of 640 million per annum and is unlikely to be put in place.
A spokesman for Dr Reilly said: There are likely to be several further draft reports developed before the group completes its work.
Recommendations are subject to debate and may therefore be changed, revised, may become more detailed, or indeed removed entirely.

Tnaiste Joan Burton insisted jobs would be protected in the sale of the Governments stake in Aer Lingus .
She said the airline had been involved in significant recruitment in the recent past.
Dil backs sale of State stake in  Aer Lingus
This is an airline that is going to expand, she said.
She added the company was committed to a regular and structured interaction with the trade unions relating to terms and conditions of employees.
Ms Burton said the House would shortly consider legislation on registered employment agreements. She said the airline customer had been forgotten in the debate on the issue.
Ms Burton said the key issue in a consultants report was that it referred to business abroad. So it has no impact or inference for employment in Aer Lingus in Ireland ,  she added.
She said Nyras, as she understood it, was a consultancy company engaged by Aer Lingus to carry out confidential analysis of the airlines cost structure.
The report was an internal document in a private company and it would not be common for Government departments and the Cabinet to receive a copy, she added.
Fianna Fil spokesman Timmy Dooley said the vote on the Governments motion allowing the sale to go ahead should be postponed so there could be further debate on the issue.
We can sit next week to do it, in line with original promises made by the Government, he added. We can look at these so-called legal guarantees, the emergence of this B share and whether it is all it is made out to be and so on.
Sinn Fin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald said the deal contained vague or, at least, qualified promises of no compulsory redundancies and no out-sourcing. The pensioners are to get nothing, but the executives are to enjoy a bonanza, pay-outs of the scale of a bonanza, she added.
Renua Ireland TD Lucinda Creighton said IAG had the resources to invest in stock and aircraft to which Aer Lingus otherwise would not have access. Companies that cannot invest and renew die, she added.

Clare TD Michael McNamara has said he wants to run for the Labour Party in the forthcoming general election, despite losing the party whip in the Dil.
Mr McNamara was the only Coalition deputy to vote against the proposed sale of the States 25 per cent stake in Aer Lingus to International Airlines Group (IAG) when it was put to a Dil vote yesterday.
Speaking afterwards, Mr McNamara said he still hoped to stand for Labour at the next election and party sources indicated he will be given a favourable hearing if he applies to rejoin the parliamentary party in the coming months.
Labour TD calls on Taoiseach to drive  domestic immigration reform after US visit
I want to stand for the Labour Party at the next election. I believe the Labour Party has done a good job in government, Mr McNamara said.
Party whip Emmet Stagg said the consequences of voting against the party were well known, and automatically involved expulsion from the parliamentary party.
Mr Stagg said it was open to Mr McNamara to apply to the rejoin the parliamentary party, and his application would be considered by TDs and Senators at such a time.
Mr McNamara said the issue of connectivity is hugely important to him and expressed concern about the so-called golden share in the airline, which will be held by the Minister for Finance and gives the State a veto over any future sale of slots at Heathrow airport.
In the past, that hasnt worked, it hasnt been enforceable, Mr McNamara said. Ultimately IAG is a business, it is purely a business. It is solely in the business of making money.
While Shannon Airport is in his Clare constituency, Mr McNamara said there is more concern locally about AI  artificial insemination of cattle  than IAG.
Mr McNamara is the sixth Labour TD to lose the whip after voting against the Government since the Coalition took office.
Two of them, Tommy Broughan and Risn Shortall, remain Independent TDs and are strongly critical of the Government.
Colm Keaveney, who voted against the Social Welfare Bill in 2012, later joined Fianna Fil while Patrick Nulty resigned his seat in Dublin West.
However, Westmeath TD Willie Penrose, who resigned as minister of state in protest at the closure of Mullingar Army barracks, rejoined the parliamentary party after losing the whip for a period.
Speaking last night, Minister for Transport Paschal Donohoe said he regretted Mr McNamaras decision but repeated his view that the sale of the States 25 per cent share in Aer Lingus was in the best interests of the company and the country.

Garda arrested over alleged media role in Roma children case
Arrest follows 2013 incidents where children taken from families over abduction fears
Former Ombudsman for Children Emily Logan in a report published last July concluded that information about one of two children taken from their homes in October 2013 in Westmeath and Dublin had on the balance of probability been disclosed by a member of the Garda to the journalist who wrote the initial reports on the first child being taken.

A senior Garda officer has been arrested over his alleged dealings with the media when members of the force took two Roma children from their families after their skin, eye and hair colour aroused suspicions around the childrens parentage.
The officer now under arrest has already had his phone examined and his office searched under warrant.
His arrest on Thursday morning was anticipated but has been greeted with surprise in Garda and security circles as he was authorised to speak to the media at the time of the contentious events and had been instructed to do so.
The National Union of Journalists said there were unusual aspects to the case that it would be watching very closely.
It would be important that nothing would happen that would damage the release of information in the public interest, said NUJ Irish secretary Seamus Dooley .
Balance of probability
The former Ombudsman for Children Emily Logan in a report published last July concluded information about one of two children taken from their homes in October 2013 in Westmeath and Dublin had on the balance of probability been disclosed by a member of the Garda to the journalist who wrote the initial reports on the first child being taken.
It went on to say that all parties involved in the case regarded this development as deeply troubling and highly regrettable.
The information reported did not lead to the children being taken. Instead, it confirmed the Garda had taken them, with the event becoming a major embarrassment to the force.
The families were forced to undergo DNA testing to prove their link to the children, after which they were returned to their parents.
Ms Logan said the disclosure of the information about one of the children may have amounted to a breach of discipline and/or an offence.
While she did not recommend a criminal investigation, Garda Commissioner Noirin OSullivan was quick to establish an inquiry.
Senior officer
That inquiry identified a senior officer based in Garda Headquarters, Phoenix Park, Dublin, as a suspect and it is he who was arrested at 7.30am on Thursday. He went to a Garda station in Dublin by arrangement.
A number of Garda sources said they were surprised the allegations were being treated as a criminal matter rather than a possible professional error.
The two Roma children were taken from their families by the Garda in October 2013 and briefly held in the care of the HSE before being returned when DNA evidence established the familial link.
Members of the public relayed suspicions the children had been abducted because their hair, eyes and skin were not the same colour as the Roma family groups they were living with.
The reports to the Garda were prompted by a case in the international media at the time about a blonde-haired, blue-eyed child having allegedly been abducted by a Roma couple in Greece .

Judge allows children in care to take holiday abroad
Parents tell  court they fear influence  of filthy rich foster carers over young children
The Dublin District Family Court has heard a social worker and court-appointed guardian said two  children in interim care should be allowed to take a holiday with their foster carers. They were looking forward to it and were very excited. File photograph: Getty Images

Two young children in interim care are to be allowed to travel abroad on holiday with their foster carers after a judge at the Dublin District Family Court dispensed with the need for their parents permission.
The childrens parents had refused permission, fearing the filthy rich foster carers were influencing the children, particularly their daughter.
She has things: a horse, lambs named after her . . . they are showing her a life that no one could provide, the mother said.
The young children were taken into care in early 2014 on an interim basis.
The reasons were not outlined in court, but they include serious allegations of abuse which the parents have vigorously denied.
The court was told the foster carers, who were sourced through a private foster agency, booked a holiday for themselves, the foster children and other family members. The parents were not informed until early this month, and they refused permission.
Access visits
The foster carers told the children of the holiday and told them their parents were not consenting.
The court also heard the younger of the two children had been refusing to attend access visits with her parents since earlier this year.
She had said she did not want to go back to Ma and Da because they are poor and her foster carers are rich and have loads of things.
The childrens mother said she felt in her heart if her daughter had a break from the carers while they took the holiday, she would resume attending access visits.
She said her son had run into an access visit and asked whether he and his sister could go on holiday. He described a house facing a beach with two jacuzzis and big swimming pools, she said.
Thats not normal . . . Ive asked for them to have a normal life, she said.
She and her husband had come under pressure to change their minds about permission over the holiday, the mother said.
She thought highly of the foster mother, but the family was filthy rich and she believed her daughter was being pulled away from her. She was also angry she and her husband had been made to look like the bad guys.
Excited
The Child and Family Agency solicitor apologised to the parents and acknowledged the matter had not been handled correctly.
The social worker and the court-appointed guardian said the children should be allowed to take the holiday. They were looking forward to it and were very excited.
The social worker said the foster carers were doing everything in their power to encourage the girl to attend access visits with her parents. She also said the girl wouldnt be riding ponies on access visit days, and she did not believe lifestyle was an issue.
Judge Brendan Toale said he accepted the parents views were genuinely held and not motivated by spite or other unworthy motivations.
He said the interests of the children had not been well served by their unnecessary involvement in the holiday proposal.
He said the court was being asked to pick up the pieces of the debacle, and it was reprehensible.
There had been a systemic failure and a failure of professional standards, and he believed what happened had exacerbated the concerns and suspicions of the parents.
He said it was in the best interests of the children the holiday go ahead and ordered that the children were to be informed about it appropriately, and it was not to be presented as a victory or a defeat for anyone.

The decision was finally made to sell off some of the family silver in the Dil yesterday.
It was removed from the States sideboard amid bitter exchanges and recrimination among the Leinster House political family.
One family member expected to support the sale could not bring himself to do so.
Dil backs sale of State stake in  Aer Lingus
Clare Labour TD Michael McNamara voted against the Government motion to sell its Aer Lingus share.
Government and Opposition traded insults over the two-day debate and, then, yesterday evening, it was time for the vote.
McNamara took his place next to former leader Eamon Gilmore and quickly pressed the No button. He later walked with the Opposition into the Nl lobby when Sinn Fins Dessie Ellis called a walk-through vote.
Comfortable majority
The Government, as expected, had a comfortable majority of 74 votes to 51.
Earlier, McNamara had confirmed rumours sweeping Leinster House that he would oppose the motion.
Addressing Minister for Transport Paschal Donohoe across the chamber, he conceded that much had been done to meet Labour Party concerns about the sale.
The Minister listened carefully, cradling a near-empty glass of water in his hands.
McNamara said there were outstanding issues.
There are questions I have . . . questions unanswered, and, in that context, I am not prepared to gamble with what I believe is the key to the economic development of all of this State, he added.
He talked of previous sales. Where is Irish Sugar now ? he asked. When I was canvassing for the Labour Party recently, I saw its rusting remains on the outskirts of Carlow town.
McNamara said he appreciated that the Minister had taken time with his officials, very late on Wednesday night, in an attempt to allay his fears. But it was not enough.
The Minister had his glass of water replenished and he took a sip.
By then, it was very clear his Coalition colleague would be voting against the motion and there was no way back.
Earlier, McNamara listened as the Fianna Fil leader Michel Martin strongly criticised the Government for the sale.
Martin accused the Coalition of engaging in a snow job and pretending all was rosy in the aviation garden.
What is a snow job ?, asked McNamara.
Martin replied that it was a Cork expression. It is a colloquial phrase, he added.
McNamara had the expression of somebody who believed one could learn something new every day.
Meanwhile, with the family silver sold, the Dil took a weeks holidays.
These might be lean times, with an empty aviation sideboard, but the long June break in the constituency retreat remains firmly in place.
