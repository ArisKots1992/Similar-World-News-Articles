Two months ago, Wendy, 28, lost an appeal against a court decision to place her now two-year-old daughter with another family. She may never see her again: Losing her has been agony, just traumatic. The thought that she is being brought up by a couple of strangers and not her blood family is torture. I wont ever come to terms with it.
Wendy, who already had Lucy, five, decided to become a surrogate in July 2012. A former administrator, she says: I remember reading about a woman whod had a longed-for child through a surrogate and felt overwhelmed with emotion. I adored having Lucy and began thinking how terrible it must be for couples who cant have a child.
Wed planned to add to our family, but I thought it would be wonderful to have a baby for a couple who couldnt have children first.
Wendy broached the subject with her partner, James, 23, and the couple discussed the possible strain on their family life, as well as the health implications for Wendy, before deciding to go ahead.
He felt the same way as me, Wendy says.
After registering her details with a reputable surrogacy website, where couples can advertise for surrogates and vice versa, Wendy, who lives in the north of England, was delighted when just a few days later she was contacted by Jane and William, a couple in their 40s.
They were desperate to have a baby, she says. Jane told me health problems meant shed had to have a hysterectomy and so had missed out on having a family. My heart went out to them.
Obviously this meant Wendy would have to use her own eggs and would be biologically related to any baby that was born. But after careful thought, and moved by the couples apparently desperate situation, she chose to go ahead.
Every month, when a woman goes through her cycle, an egg is wasted  I felt I would be giving life to an egg that would otherwise not have life and James agreed, she concluded.
Newborn: The surrogate baby girl when she was born in 2013 - her mother was paid 7,000 over nine months
Over the next four weeks the couples chatted regularly online and on the phone, eventually deciding to meet.
They came to meet us at our home, she recalls. I was relieved when I opened the door to see a smartly dressed couple. They said they both had professional jobs in management, and reassured us they had no criminal record or financial worries.
We all got on incredibly well and they just seemed so genuine and down-to-earth, it felt as if wed been friends for years. We even shared the same sense of humour. James and I both felt a connection with them and I couldnt wait to have their baby.
While its illegal in the UK to pay a woman to have a baby, reasonable expenses are allowed to cover maternity outlays and the couple insisted on paying Wendy 7,000 spread over nine months because she would have to take time off work for midwife appointments and scans, and buy maternity clothes.
At the same time, the couple also agreed to Wendys wish to see the child weekly as she grew up.
As surrogacy contracts arent legally enforceable, we agreed everything verbally on trust, she says.
Swept up in the excitement of helping the couple realise their dream, events then moved fast, something Wendy now regrets.
As it was, two weeks later Wendy worked out she was at the most fertile time in her cycle and arranged to meet the couple at a nearby hotel.
She says: Over the next three days I artificially inseminated myself with Williams sperm using a syringe designed for giving a child medicine. I was delighted when I got pregnant immediately and announced the news by sending them a photo of my positive pregnancy test.
Apart from morning sickness the pregnancy was straightforward.
The wife came to all my scans and seemed genuinely thrilled when she saw the baby kicking, she says.
We spoke every day and I saw them at least once a month. I even went to stay with them for a week so they could spoil me and give me a rest, and I saw nothing that suggested they werent genuine.
At the time, even though this was biologically my child, I didnt have any maternal feelings towards it. I always knew I was having a baby for this couple.
Magic moment: This is the January 2013 scan that revealed Wendy was having a baby girl
By January 2013 a scan revealed Wendy was having a baby girl. Wendy says: They were both over the moon about having a daughter.
That May Wendy went into labour. A midwife rang the couple and the woman joined her in the delivery room. After six hours Emily was born weighing a healthy 8lb. Wendy says: I was so proud Id produced such a bonny baby. As she held her, the look on the womans face was incredible and I could see she was overjoyed.
An enormous feeling of loss immediately struck me. My whole body ached for Emily and I couldnt wait to see her again
Wendy Reid
I didnt want to hold Emily as I didnt want to bond with her. But she kept crying and in the end I said, Put her on my chest as I remembered Lucy being comforted by that as a newborn.
It was then, as the midwife laid Emily onto Wendy, she was hit by an overwhelming feeling of maternal love for the baby girl  and the first pangs of uncertainty about handing her over to her new mum began to stir.
I looked down at her and she immediately quietened. She seemed so vulnerable and beautiful. The rush of feelings for her came out of the blue. It was a terrible shock and I desperately told myself, This is not your baby. I knew I had to leave the hospital and get away as I was bonding with her.
Within four hours Wendy had discharged herself and, after giving Emily a kiss, left her in the arms of her new mother. She says: James took me home. I felt upset, but put it down to exhaustion and quickly went to sleep.
The next day Wendy woke panic-stricken. An enormous feeling of loss immediately struck me. My whole body ached for Emily and I couldnt wait to see her again.
She and James went back to the hospital to say their final goodbyes. She recalls: I walked into the side room where the woman was holding Emily. I longed to sweep her into my arms and cuddle her.
The only thing that stopped me from wrenching Emily from them was seeing them so besotted with her.
James carried baby Emily outside where Wendy gave her a final hug and her new parents strapped her into a car seat.
Emily had socks on that were too tight around her ankles, she says. Her nappy was dirty and she seemed ravenously hungry  when I gave her a bottle she couldnt gulp down the milk fast enough
Wendy Reid
She says: As soon as I got home I felt sick with grief. I rushed to the bathroom where I broke down in huge breathless sobs. Eventually, I allowed James in and he said over and over, You had this baby for another couple and you will have to live with it.
He wasnt being cruel. He was simply stating the facts. I knew he was right. I had made my choice. I reassured myself they were great parents, reminding myself how happy they looked at the hospital.
Over the next few days Wendy expressed milk for Emily. She says: Wed arranged that I would do this for six months and they would pick up the milk every couple of days.
Two days later the couple arrived with Emily and Wendy couldnt help herself  rushing out of the house to scoop the baby out of her car seat because she was so desperate to hold her.
The next four weeks were a struggle. Wendy clung onto the pre-arranged weekly meetings, as agreed at the start of the surrogacy process.
The meetings when they would bring Emily to see me was all I could think about, says Wendy. The longing to see her was painful.
Tough: Wendy, pictured while pregnant, said the longer it went on after she handed over her baby the worse her pain got because she feared for the child's welfare
Far worse was to come, however. Three weeks later, Wendy met the couple to discuss the final adoption arrangements, and was horrified by what she saw.
Emily had socks on that were too tight around her ankles, she says. Her nappy was dirty and she seemed ravenously hungry  when I gave her a bottle she couldnt gulp down the milk fast enough. She always seemed to be hungry. Id pick her up and shed root around for milk, even though they assured me shed only just been fed.
I began texting, reminding them to ensure she was fed properly. I became obsessed that her nappy wasnt being changed often enough.
Then one day, five weeks later, when the couple didnt reply to a text, Wendy began to panic.
I was in such a state I even rang the police to check they were OK  that their car hadnt been involved in an accident. When the officer asked why I was so concerned, I replied, Because they have my biological daughter. 
The next day she received a text from the couple saying they no longer wanted her to contact them.
While I can never regret bringing such a wonderful baby into the world, I do regret being a surrogate. Women should consider it very carefully before they go ahead
Wendy Reid
By now Wendy had received the legal order she was due to sign, legally transferring parental rights over Emily to them.
But she refused to sign it, instead launching a bid for custody. A social worker was assigned to the case to carry out reports. And what was uncovered about the couple was truly shocking.
Instead of the childless couple theyd pretended to be, social services discovered they were in fact already parents to three children, now grown up, whod been taken into care more than 20 years ago.
Theyd lied to us with sob stories, Wendy says. She hadnt even had a hysterectomy. It was an utter bombshell, as wed trusted them implicitly.
We were horrified, but the only upside was that it left James and me certain Emily would be returned to us. Although he wasnt her biological father, James wanted her back, too.
Nothing could have prepared Wendy for the court judgment in June 2014; she was denied custody.
She says: Social services claimed that because Id given up Emily at birth I had a lack of emotional attachment to her.
They also used the fact that because Wendy had excitedly talked to Lucy about her sister, and put photos up in the house of her, that she had emotionally neglected her older daughter  a black mark against her character which ultimately led to her being ruled as unsuitable to raise her new baby.
The other couple were also not judged as suitable and so it was ordered Emily should be adopted by strangers.
Wendy fled from the court in tears. She says: I couldnt believe their reasoning  especially after Id done so much to try to get Emily back.
Wendy has undoubtedly paid a high price for her altruism in trying to help another couple.
The custody bid, and the subsequent appeal, cost her thousands, wiping out her savings.
And the stress of the legal battle also cost Wendy her relationship with James; this January, they split up. Then, in March, Wendys appeal was turned down.
Not surprisingly, Wendy has very strong advice for anyone contemplating becoming a surrogate. While I can never regret bringing such a wonderful baby into the world, I do regret being a surrogate, she says. Women should consider it very carefully before they go ahead.
Even if you are giving birth to a child that is not biologically yours, there is still likely to be a bond.
I now dont understand how any mother can give up a child she has given birth to whether they are biologically related or not.
As it is, all Wendy is left with are her memories, a handful of photos and some baby clothes. She is determined that Emily will know how desperately she fought for her.
She says: I have some unwashed clothes that belonged to Emily and find comfort in holding them close to me as they still have her smell. Otherwise I cope by telling myself Emilys been given to a family who want her very much.
And I console myself that I will see her again  when she is 18, she will be able to trace me.
Not a day goes by when I dont think of her.
All names other than Wendy Reids have been changed.

Before Warner's rally, Judicial officer Ibrahim Ali said the 72-year-old had earlier complained of exhaustion and was taken in an ambulance from prison in the twin-island Caribbean nation off the coast of Venezuela.
When asked if thought Blatter should also face charges, Warner told the BBC World Service: 'Sure.
'If am supposed to be this corrupt person... he was my president for 24 years.
'I didn't push my hand in the till of FIFA. I'm not a FIFA treasurer. I didn't write cheques for FIFA. If I am corrupt, it must be someone else who had given me the money.
'If I am this corrupt person, he (Blatter) shouldn't be allowed to go free.'
Jack Warner turns himself in amid FIFA corruption probe
Impassioned: Warner gives a lengthy, defiant speech professing his innocence before a crowd of raucous supporters in the district he represents as an opposition member of Parliament
Disgraced: Warner was forced out of FIFA in 2011 over a bribery scandal but has denied any wrongdoing
Warner had surrendered to authorities Wednesday and was granted a $395,000 (257,000) bond but spent the night in jail.
He faces eight counts in the U.S., including conspiracy to defraud and to engage in racketeering.
He has not entered a plea and is expected to appear in court in July.
A judge ordered Warner to surrender his passport and report to police twice a week.
Warner was forced out of FIFA in 2011 over a bribery scandal but has denied any wrongdoing.
Trinidad's attorney general, Garvin Nicholas, said the U.S. has two months to issue a formal extradition request.
He said his office has been working with the U.S. Justice Department for about two years on the investigation of Warner.
U.S. justice officials allege, among other things, that Warner received three payments totaling $10 million in 2008 from an unidentified, high-ranking FIFA official.
They said the money was deposited in a U.S. account controlled by Warner.
Frosty: UEFA President Michel Platini (centre) speaks with Sepp Blatter (left) at the 65th FIFA Congress in Zurich a day after he called on the FIFA president to stand down amid the corruption scandal
Defiant: Blatter is facing calls to resign, but he insists he is the man to clean up the sport's governing body
Authorities say the money was allegedly offered to secure Warner's vote and help give South Africa the right to host the 2010 World Cup over Morocco.
South Africa's sports minister on Thursday denied any wrongdoing by his country's government.
Warner also faced scrutiny from FIFA over a sports complex he built in Trinidad more than a decade ago with financial help from the organisation and whose ownership has been disputed.
The Centre of Excellence features a soccer field, a pool and several meeting halls, including ones named after FIFA President Sepp Blatter and former South Africa President Nelson Mandela.
Messages left with the center's officials were not returned. The centre regularly hosts conferences, weddings, soccer matches and other events.

	David Cameron's bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe was attacked by French foreign minister Laurent Fabius yesterday, just hours before he arrived in Paris for talks.

        <MainBody>French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said the British referendum was 'very risky'
David Cameron's bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe was attacked by
French
government yesterday  just hours before the Prime Minister arrived in Paris for crunch talks.
French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said the bid to change the EU treaties was like joining a football club but then deciding 'in the middle of the match we are now going to play rugby'.
Mr Fabius's remarks came as the Prime Minister kicked off his 48-hour whistlestop tour of European capitals in a bid to agree reforms  before putting the proposals to an in/out referendum by the end of 2017.
The Prime Minister held a working lunch in the Netherlands with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte before flying to Paris for talks with the French President Francois Hollande last night.
Mr Fabius said the British referendum on whether to leave the EU was dangerous for Brussels.
But ahead of last night's meeting, he said: 'We will listen to him and see what he proposes. He launched this referendum project, it is something very risky.
'
He said France wanted the UK to stay in the EU and admitted 'things need to be improved'.
But he
said: '
Britain joined a football club. They can't now say in the middle of the match that they want to play rugby. It's one thing or the other.'
Mr Fabius admitted British voters may choose to walk away from the EU when the referendum is held.
He said: 'The British population has gotten used to being told: 'Europe is a bad thing', and the day they are asked to decide, the risk is that they say Europe is a bad thing.'
His remarks came after the British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned that Britain would vote to leave the European Union if Mr Cameron's demands are blocked.
David Cameron arrived in Paris this evening in a bid to overhaul Britain's relationship with Europe  just hours after the French foreign minister attacked his proposals
French President Francois Hollande greeted Mr Cameron on the steps of the Elysee Palace ahead of a meeting
CAMERON'S KEY DEMANDS FOR EU REFORM BEFORE REFERENDUM
FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:
No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years
No social housing for four years
No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK
FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:
No support from the UK taxpayer
Deportation if they do not get a job for six months
Other measures include:
Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU
Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK
Tougher rules on deporting
foriegn
criminals
Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels
The Tory Cabinet minister insisted the Prime Minister was 'very confident' of winning reforms to Britain's relationship with Brussels before holding an in/out referendum - and revealed the vote could take place as early as next year.
But he said the PM was 'very clear' with other European leaders that Britain would walk away if they did not give way on his proposals to clamp down on
benefit
abuse and immigration rules.
Mr Cameron has demanded changes to the EU's treaties to stop migrants from receiving welfare - including government tax credits and child benefit - for four years after moving to the UK.
He also wants more protection for the UK against Eurozone
stitch ups
and
an special
opt out - making it clear Britain would not join an 'ever closer union' of European countries.
The Prime Minister met the Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz in Warsaw this morning before talks in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose backing will prove crucial if Mr Cameron is to secure serious reforms.
The whirlwind diplomatic push comes after the question which will be put to the British people in the EU referendum was unveiled today.
Voters will be asked to choose between saying 'Yes' to staying in and 'No' to sever ties with Brussels.
In an apparent attempt to ensure the campaign to remain in the EU has a more positive message, the question will be worded so the Yes campaign is in favour of staying in.
It means the negative No campaign led by Eurosceptics will be making the case for the UK to leave the 28-nation bloc.
But Mr Hammond, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, warned the Government would 'lose' the vote if the EU renegotiation failed.
David Cameron began his tour of European capitals with a working lunch with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte at The Hague today
David Cameron has demanded changes to the EU's treaties to stop migrants from receiving welfare
last week Mr Cameron held talks with the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Chequers
He said: 'We're at the very beginning of a process here. The Prime Minister is starting his tour of European capitals today, talking to his counterparts across Europe.
'We have a clear set of requirements and the Prime Minister is very clear with dealing with European Union counterparts that if we are not able to deliver on these big areas of concern that the British people have then we will not win the referendum when it comes.
'We expect our European partners to engage with us on delivering a package that will enable the British people to decide that they think Britain's future is best delivered inside the European Union.'
Mr Hammond said the Government was prepared for a fight, but insisted it was confident of winning changes.
EU REFERENDUM QUESTION REVEALED: 'SHOULD THE UNITED KINGDOM REMAIN A MEMBER OF THE EUROPEAN UNION':
Voters will be asked if the UK should 'remain a member' of the European Union when they go to the polls for the in/out referendum, Downing Street has confirmed.
The wording of the question that will appear on ballot papers means supporters of Britain retaining its ties to Brussels will form the 'Yes' campaign.
Details of the question and a commitment to staging the popular vote by the end of 2017 are contained in a Bill introduced into Parliament today.
Downing Street said the measures being published provide a 'concrete step' towards settling the row over Britain's links with Brussels.
The Conservatives' preferred wording for the in/out referendum question - ''Do you think that the United Kingdom should be a member of the European Union?'' - has been dropped following concerns by the Electoral Commission that some people might think the country was not already a member.
Instead the watchdog's recommended choice for voters has been adopted in the EU Referendum Bill.It reads: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union?'

The fatal attack came just three months after James Attfield was killed in the Essex town, in 'one of the most brutal' killings ever seen by the police.
Mr Attfield, who had a brain injury after being hit by a car four years before his death, was found fighting for his life in the town's Castle Park on March 29 last year. He died later in
hospital
The two deaths prompted fears that a killer was randomly targeting members of the
public,
after officers said there were 'striking similarities' in how they were killed.

After the second killing, police warned the public not to 'go out alone in isolated places' while detectives hunted the killer.
Speaking at the time, Detective Chief Superintendent Steve
Worron
said a criminal profiler had assessed both cases.
COLCHESTER KILLINGS TIMELINE
March 29, 2014 - 10:09pm: James Attfield leaves River Lodge pub in Colchester.
March 30 - 5:45am: Mr Attfield is found clinging onto life in Lower Castle Park with 102 stab wounds. He later dies in hospital.
June 13, 2014 - 10am: Nahid
Almanea
, wearing a burka, leaves her home in Colchester to walk to the University of Essex.
10:20am: Ms Almanea is seen on CCTV on
Hunwicke
road, just a few minutes away from Salary Brook Trail in Colchester.
10:40am:
Saudi
student is found bleeding to death on the path with 16 stab wounds.
May 26, 2015 - 11am: Boy, 16, arrested on Salary Brook Trail on suspicion of possessing an offensive weapon.
May 29: Detectives arrest same teenager on suspicion of murdering Ms Almanea and Mr Attfield.
He
added: '
The circumstances of both crimes mean that we must consider the possibility that the same killer or killers are responsible.
'We are continuing to explore this line of inquiry, along with many others, and both investigations are being continually resourced and are receiving equal precedence.'
Ms Almanea's post-mortem examination showed her cause of death was several knife wounds.
Det Chief Supt
Worron
said: 'She suffered at least two knife wounds which would have proved fatal on their own, but in total she was stabbed 16 times to her body, neck, head and arms.
'She also suffered an injury to the back of her
head
but that is believed to have been caused when she fell to the ground during the attack.'
It was said that she would usually walk to university with her brother, with whom she lived, but he started earlier than her on Tuesday so they walked separately.
Ms Almanea was taking a language course at Essex University ahead of starting a life sciences
PhD

	U.S lawyers claim a palatial-style mansion belonging to vice-president Jeffrey Webb is one of more than twelve properties allegedly connected to the bribery and corruption scandal.

According to the indictment, Mr Webb, who is also president of CONCACAF, allegedly received a wire transfer to fund a new pool which he was building at the home.
This 1m apartment inside a tower block (pictured) overlooking Biscayne Bay, Miami, which is owned by sports executive Aaron Davidson is also named in the indictment
The Daily Telegraph reports that the bribe was allegedly sent by Traffic Sports USA, a sports marketing company seeking lucrative commercial rights contracts with Fifa.
The indictment also names two more of Mr Webb's properties in Georgia, both of which are registered in the name of Kosson Properties.
The firm is believed to have been set up by Costas Takkas, a British official who acted as his attach as Concacaf president.
One property is a family-sized home spanning 2,846 sq ft, while the other is a three-bedroom property about five miles away.
Meanwhile, other properties named on the indictment include a 1million apartment overlooking Miami;s Biscayne Bay, which is owned by Aaron Davidson.
The 44-year-old is the president of Traffic Sports and is one of four sports executives charged by U.S prosecutors.
Rafael Esquivel, 68, the president of the Venezuelan football federation, is also reportedly linked with three properties named in the indictment. 
Separately, Jack Warner, the former Fifa vice-president, boasts an impressive property portfolio.
The 72-year-old lives in a large detached house in Trinidad and, along with his two sons, owns at least a dozen properties, mainly in Miami.
Edward Li, who was also arrested in the dawn raid at the five-star hotel in Zurich, owns a 400,000 home in Floria, as well as a property in one of the most expensive parts of his native Costa Rica.
The U.S Department of Justice has charged 18 people over alleged bribes totalling almost 100million paid for television rights, sponsorship deals and World Cup votes.
Fifa's controversial chief Sepp Blatter, pictured yesterday in Zurich,faces losing his decades-long presidency in a knife-edge vote later today
Under suspicion: Vice president Jeffrey Webb (above), who was among those arrestedduring a dramatic dawn raid at a five-star hotel in Switzerland on Wednesday, owns several properties listed in the indictment
The indictment alleges South Africa paid 6.5million to disgraced former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner for votes to host the 2010 World Cup  with the money being channelled through a Fifa bank account authorised by an unnamed high-ranking Fifa official.
In a separate development, the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings over the award process that decided who should host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and will question ten current Fifa executive committee members who voted.
Yesterday, it also emerged that two of Britains biggest High Street banks, Barclays and HSBC, had also been named in legal papers filed by the US Department of Justice.
They alleged that millions of dollars in suspect transactions linked to Fifa were allegedly moved through their accounts.
Both banks declined to comment.

	Georgia Marrison dies of stomach cancer after doctors misdiagnose with 'diet'

	Georgia Marrison's weight plummeted by two stone and she was consistently vomiting and falling ill. But medics said the 18-year-old from Rotherham just wanted to be 'paper thin'.

Georgia, a student at Thomas Rotherham College, began feeling run down and tired in May last year and one of her eyes swelled up every morning.
She went to a walk-in centre where medics diagnosed her with dietary anaemia and prescribed iron tablets.
Ms Marrison is calling for parents and medics to pay attention to the signs of cancer in teenagers and believes helping others will be justice for Georgia (pictured together)
When the 18-year-old from Rotherham was eventually admitted to hospital, doctors found she had cancer in her eye and ovaries, pictured with her younger sister Alex (right)
But the 18-year-old continued to vomit after eating and despite repeated visits to her GP her condition deteriorated.
She lost two stone and even collapsed on the stairs before one doctor's appointment.
Ms Marrison, who also has a 15-year-old daughter called Alex, said: 'At one point she came home and cried and said 'why won't nobody believe me?'
'She kept throwing up and couldn't keep anything down. One day she said 'mum, what can I eat that will taste nice on the way back up?'
'Georgia loved her food. I know my children and it couldn't have been further from the truth that she was trying to be a stick insect. She loved her food but was never overweight. She was healthy.'
She took Georgia to A&amp;E at the Northern General Hospital in September and begged medics for extra tests.
Ms Marrison begged hospital staff for more tests her daughter was finally diagnosed with an aggressive form of stomach cancer
Ms Marrison said: 'She was wasting away before my eyes and I took her to A&amp;E in the September and I said I wasn't leaving until somebody helps me.'
Doctors found she had cancer in her eye and ovaries and she also contracted meningitis - a rare side effect of cancer.
The diagnosis came on September 21 - the same day Georgia was due to move into halls of residence at the University of Sheffield where she was to study English Literature.
She lost her battlewith cancer just weeks later on November 11.
Ms Marrison said: 'I realise that the outcome would have been the same but her suffering could have been less.
'The impression we got from the walk-in centre was that it looked to GPs that she was just a silly teenage girl who wanted to be thin.
'I want parents who have a daughter or son experiencing the same symptoms as Georgia to think 'I need to go back to the doctor's with my child'.'
'If GPs are just going to ignore the warning signs because someone is 18,19 or 20 then their actions are wrong.
'There is a Teenage Cancer Unit in Sheffield and that obviously means that it is on the increase.'
Ms Marrison, who has Georgia's ashes in two tattoos on her arm and in a ring, plans to fund raise in her memory for the Teenage Cancer Unit.
'It was a horrendous time for her. My hope now is that she didn't die in vain,' she said.
'I get that the outcome for Georgia couldn't have been any different but her suffering could have been less.'
'Georgia was amazing, she never caused any trouble and caused a wicked sense of humour. I used to hear parents always say that their children look up to them but I looked up to her, she was incredible.
'She loved her music and two weeks before she died the cancer unit arranged for her to meet Paolo Nutini at Sheffield Arena. He gave her a plectrum which she was buried with.'
A spokesman for Cancer Research said cases of stomach cancer in teenagers are 'incredibly rare'.
Statistics for 2008 to 2011 reveal that in the 15 to 19 age group there were four cases per 100,000 of the population each year, of which three were male and one was female.

INDEGESTION, DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING AND WEIGHT LOSS: THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STOMACH CANCER
Around 7,100 cases of stomach cancer are diagnosed in the UK each year
Stomach cancer in teenagers is 'incredibly rare', according toCancer Research.
In the 15 to 19 age group there were just four cases per 100,000 of the population each year from  2008 to 2011.
Of these three were male and one was female.
The disease is more prevalent in men, with twice as many cases diagnosed in males as females.
As with other cancers, the disease is more common in older people. Around 95 per cent of all cases are in people aged 55 and older.
There are five different types of stomach cancer.
The most common is adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which accounts for 95 per cent of cases.
The disease starts in the gland cells - which produce mucus and stomach juices - in the stomach lining.
More rare forms of the disease are squamous cell cancers, lymphoma of the stomach, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and neuroendocrine tumours.
A number of factors increase a person's chances of developing stomach cancer.
They include:
Diet
A diet high in certain preserved foods is thought to increase a person's risk.
Several large studies have found a small increase in risk among those people who eat a lot of preserved meat, including bacon, sausages and ham.
A more recent study showed vegetarians may have a lower risk of the disease, and plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables are thought to reduce the risk of stomach cancer.
Helicobacter pylori infection
Infection with the helicobacter bacteria increases the risk of stomach cancer by around six times.
However, millions are infected with the bacteria and don't go on to developing the disease. It is thought smoking and poor diet may interact with the bacteria to trigger the disease.
The bacteria causes an inflammatory condition called severe chronic atrophic gastritis and this can lead to stomach cancer.
Tobacco and alcohol
Around one in five stomach cancers are thought to be caused by smoking.
Smokers have double the risk of stomach cancer compared to their non smoking peers.
But scientists believe the risk falls if you stop smoking.
Those smokers with an HP infection may have more than 10 times the risk of non smokers without an HP infection.
There are five different types of stomach cancer. The most common is adenocarcinoma of the stomach, which accounts for 95 per cent of cases, pictured
Other factors
As with all cancers, having a family history of stomach cancer increases a person's risk.
In addition men are at heightened risk if they have already suffered prostate, breast, bladder or testicular cancer.
Women are at increased risk if they've had ovarian, breast or cervical cancer.
And oesophageal, non melanoma skin cancer, bowel, thyroid cancers, and non Hodgkin's lymphoma increase the risk for both sexes.

Symptoms of stomach cancer include:
indigestion, acidity and burping

	'Do Big Macs grow on trees?': Parents share the bizarre questions posed by children online (and their own baffled responses)

	A thread posted on Reddit asked parents to submit bizarre questions asked by their children - with hilarious results. Queries range from the smell of ducks to whether or not Big Macs grow on trees.

'When my daughter was about three, I got her a McDonald's happy meal as a treat..,' wrote one Reddit user.
'She then gave me a handful of sesame seeds she had picked off the top of the burger bun and asked me if we could plant them in the backyard to grow a burger tree...
'[I] had to explain to her that burgers don't grow on trees..'
Another commenter described his childhood disappointment when he discovered that salamis don't grow on trees - despite his mother telling him that they do.
One little boy wondered whether you become a fish finger when you go to Heaven
Faced with a tough question, some parents opted to give evasive answers
One user shared his childhood memories - and a question about whether salamis grow in trees
One little girl appears to have developed an unusual taste for building materials
'When I was around three years old my mother and sister lied to me saying salami grew as a plant,' revealed the Reddit user,
'I planted half a pound of salami outside and they laughed in my face when I went inside to clean up. I haven't trusted them since.'
Other users focused on their own children's questions and revealed responses that ranged from speechlessness to hysterical laughter.
One mother said: 'When he was about five, one of my boys asked me, if I go to heaven do I get to become a fish finger? I couldn't answer because I was laughing too much.'
Another revealed that her child had asked: 'Does Santa Claus have a penis? In July. Completely randomly. I replied that of course he did, because he was a boy.'
Most of the children that the Reddit users talked about were between the ages of three and five
Parents' responses to the weird questions range from uncontrollable laughter to speechlessness
One particularly odd enquiry was about ducks: 'My son recently asked me what a duck smells like. Other favorites are whether sheep have tails and if mermaids have butts. He's four.'
Other questions were more inappropriate and included enquiries about adult sexual acts - much to the horror of their parents.
Weird questions also took the form of children's misunderstandings of everyday situations and phrases.
One mother shared: 'Teaching my toddler about how babies grow in Mommy's tummy - he cried real tears asking me, "Why did you eat me?" This was his inference as to how he got inside me.'
Some of the questions posed were inappropriate  and garnered awkward responses from the parent
Another user shared overhearing a child enthusiastically talking about a new passion: 'Heard four yr old kid next door tell her parents that she loved concrete and dreamed about it.
One particularly hilarious question saw one Reddit user left completely stumped by their child's curiosity, as well as their own surprising lack of knowledge.
Writing on Reddit, the mother revealed her child had asked what leaves are made of. 'He was three years old and I didn't even know how to answer,' she confessed.

	BBC may change way it collects licence fee after paid users threatened

	The BBC Trust has ordered the Corporation - which sends 100,000 letters per day to chase for the fee - to investigate why threatening missives are being sent to viewers who have already paid.

The BBC executive will be asked to investigate how its system may be changed to prevent such warning letters being sent to licensed members of the public.
The BBC pays Capita, the outsourcing firm, to collect of the TV licence fee, for a cost of around 70million a year.
A spokesman for TV Licensing said that there were a specific set of circumstances which led up to the debt collection notice being sent my mistake.
In one incident, a viewer who had paid the fee was told that the case would be passed to a debt collector, and that they could face a 1,000 fine (file picture)
The complainant later set up a new licence whilst their previous licence was still valid. When they missed their cash payments, letters advised they might be referred to debt collection. This would only happen in a tiny number of cases. We can confirm we will examine these letters.
However, it is not the first time that TV Licensing has been heavily criticised for its bullying tactics.
Capitas letters send repeated threats that it will impose 1,000 fines on households who do not pay the annual 145.50 charge.
The company also brings almost 3,000 people prosecutions a week, accounting for around a tenth of all cases in magistrates courts. Anyone found guilty is left with a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 people a year are jailed.

Behind this supposedly glittering CV, however, there lies another, very different story  one that he will be slower to recount. A story that I unearthed when I travelled to Switzerland to investigate a conundrum that has long puzzled football fans: namely, how ever did this smug little man rise to power?
Originating in the small Alpine town of Visp  far from Zurich, where Blatter now lives in a sumptuous villa and holds court in Fifas huge complex of offices  it is an extraordinary tale of ruthless ambition, serial womanising and, of course, fabulous wealth and power.
Blatter was born there in 1936 and lived in a wooden hovel with his brothers, Peter and Marco, and late sister Ruth. The family was so poor they peddled fruit and vegetables from their allotment, but their father  who worked in a chemical factory  was determined his children would make something of themselves.
Marriage: Blatter is pictured left with his third wife Graziella and right with IlonaBoguska, a shapely blonde Polish tennis player whom he has previously enjoyed an on/off romance with for several years
Family: Blatter is pictured with his granddaughter Selena at the FIFA congress ceremony in Zurich in 2011
They studied hard and won places at university, but whilst the others were content with steady jobs in the backwoods, Sepp set his sights higher. According to the many former friends and colleagues I spoke to, he loved being the centre of attention.
In his teens he found recognition as a wedding singer, of all things, and he would earn extra money at weekends by yodelling goat-herders ballads at local ceremonies.
By all accounts, he also performed a mean soft-shoe shuffle (a skill he has employed in escaping blame for a plethora of scrapes and scandals) and continued these one-man shows into his late twenties.
During university holidays, he did menial jobs in ski resorts, and Swiss journalist Bruno Affentranger, author of a revealing Blatter biography, believes the Fifa boss modelled himself on a little-known US film star he met working as a waiter. His name was Eddie Constantine, and he appeared in cheap, French-made B-movies, invariably playing the same type of character  a louche, roving-eyed detective or private eye. A sort of low-grade James Bond.
Blatter told me he was deeply impressed by this actor  how he held his cigarettes, how he dressed  how he how would speak to women, the writer told me, suggesting the encounter had shaped his modus operandi ever after.
It certainly seems plausible. The first of many women to fall for this unlikely lothario was Liliane Biner, a sporty local girl. They married and had a daughter, Corinne  his only child, who still works in a bistro in Visp  but as his ambition gathered pace, he became tired of Liliane and developed a taste for younger women.
Ironically, given his ill-disguised loathing for reporters who probe his affairs, he had by then begun his serious working life  as a journalist.
Blatter addresses the opening ceremony of the FIFA congress in Zurich yesterday amid corruption claims
Sepp Blatter: There is no place for corruption in soccer
He moved into PR and, surreally, also accepted the presidency of a society whose sole aim was to lobby women to continue wearing stockings and suspenders instead of tights.
Blatter then served as general secretary of the Swiss Ice Hockey Federation before becoming an executive at Swiss watchmaker Longines, which specialises in sports timing devices. This was during the mid-70s, when colour TV and glamorous star players were changing football from a popular but chronically under-funded pastime to a potentially lucrative business attracting endorsements and sponsorship.
One of the dynamic tycoons eager to cash in was Horst Dassler, owner of sportswear firm Adidas. Having met Blatter on the sporting circuit, Dassler was evidently impressed and, looking for a placeman to lobby on his behalf at Fifa, he used his influence to get Blatter a job managing its coaching and referee training programme. Then in his late thirties, this was the break Blatter needed. With his slick marketing patter and enormous energy and dynamism (qualities he still possesses), he dazzled the blazer-and-tie wearing old time-servers who administered football, and blazed his trail to the top.
When Blatter arrived at Fifa, control of footballs governing body had passed from the upstanding English gentleman Sir Stanley Rous to Joao Havelange, later exposed for accepting bribes. But he elbowed the Brazilian aside, and in 1998 won the ultimate prize of the presidency.
The election, in which he defeated Swedish candidate Lennart Johansson  who had ironically pledged to end corruption  was widely reported to have been tainted by backhanders. But as always, Blatter was exonerated.
Having seized power, he set about creating Fifa as his fiefdom. Indeed, some have likened it to a mini-state. The rundown old Zurich villa that had served as its HQ for decades was knocked down, to be replaced by palatial offices overlooking the lake.
UEFA's Michel Platini has called for Blatter (pictured together during the 2010 World Cup) to stand down
UEFA President Platini: 'Enough is enough, Blatter must go'
Blatter rewarded himself with a vast salary that would rise towards 2million a year, plus lavish expenses. He and his cronies swanned around the world like potentates, in jets and chauffeured limousines, staying in the finest available hotels, quaffing vintage champagne, and often surrounded by celebrities and glamorous girls.
No wonder so many Third World politicians developed a sudden passion for football, and selflessly volunteered to join Fifas ranks.
When Blatter is whisked from country to glad-handing country, he invariably has his latest fancy woman in tow. As he climbed soccers greasy pole, he enraged Fifas former general secretary, Helmut Kaser, by wooing his daughter, Barbara, who was in her early 20s  almost half his age.
When she became Mrs Blatter number two, her father was not at the wedding and apparently wept on the day. Kasers humiliation was complete a few years later, when his son-in-law took his job.
The marriage ended after ten years and Barbara died at 52 from surgery complications. However, Blatter enjoyed a string of other romances. Aged 59, though balding and podgy, he began a love match with Ilona Boguska, a shapely blonde Polish tennis player whom he challenged to a game.
The romance ended, for the first time, after seven years. In 2002 he took up with another young beauty, Graziella Bianca, an alternative therapist who encourages stressed clients to swim with dolphins.
Blatter, I am told, never tried it. But she is said to have helped him cope with the stress of running Fifa. He took her as his third wife, though even he couldnt persuade the Pope to grant him a special dispensation to have the marriage blessed in church.
They were together only a short time before he left Graziella. Heartbroken, he told friends they were divorced because he was married to football. Perhaps so, yet he found time in his hectic schedule for Ilona, to whom he promptly returned. They later split up again, but he is still said to see her when in Eastern Europe.
Blatter is now 79 and with chronic arthritis, so we might have thought the champagne and roses were over. But yesterday, with alluring Mrs Barras at his side, he seemed to be sending a message: that, scandal or no scandal, there is life in the old rogue yet.

	Miss Humble said it was easy to dismiss home-grown food as ‘middle class fripperies’ but that they have an important role to play in helping people stay connected to the way food is produced.

TV presenter Kate Humble (pictured) has praised the middle classes for supporting artisan food producers
TV presenter Kate Humble yesterday praised the middle classes for supporting artisan food producers and ensuring their survival against chain supermarkets.
Best-known for her work with BBC shows Autumwatch and Countryfile, she turned her back on city life in exchange for a small holding in in Monmouthshire which she has now turned into a thriving business.
Miss Humble said it was easy to dismiss home-grown or locally produced food, now often described as artisan, as middle class fripperies.
But she said such products have a really important role to play in helping people stay connected to the way food is produced.
The 46-year-old said that despite pressures which make it easier to do a quick supermarket shop we should support those who have a great wealth of knowledge and tradition and added: Hurray for the middle classes. We should not see artisan foods as competing with the supermarket.
We all face particular pressures trying to get everything in half an hour rather than go to lovely little shops.
Miss Humble, who owns a 117-acre farm in the Wye Valley, said she finds running her own business, Humble By Nature, incredibly hard  and admitted she cries three times a week.
Speaking at the Hay Festival yesterday alongside small food producers, she said good quality food rather than expensive shoes was more important to her. She said: I am not a Jimmy Choo girl but I would spend money on a fantastic bit of cheese or jar of honey. It is worth treating ourselves.
The broadcaster continued: We have become totally disconnected from the way our food is produced, where it comes from, its very essence, for many that has gone. These artisan producers have a really important role to play.

	A letter from experts claims the proposals – aimed at reducing deaths from cancer, diabetes, strokes and dementia by a third by 2030 – would make elderly patients 'second-class citizens.'

The targets are not quite set in stone yet, so we have a final opportunity to impress upon the UN the need to alter this explicitly ageist health target.
The Sustainable Development Goals are designed to slash poverty and improve heath in the developing world. However, it is claimed they would have a knock-on effect in the UK and other Western countries.
Former director of charity Age UK, Baroness Greengross said the UN target could lead to 'institutionalised discrimination' in the UK
Although the guidelines will not be binding, health experts warn that the UN will disapprove of countries who do not follow them.
The Government said last night that there was no danger of older patients being denied treatment.
But a former director of charity Age UK, Baroness Greengross told the Daily Telegraph: If adopted, this UN target could lead to institutionalised discrimination against older people in healthcare, both here in the UK and globally.
This target will inevitably reinforce the ageist bias that pervades many aspects of health care decision-making.
Experts on ageing from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Institute for Ageing and Health at Newcastle University joined the Alzheimers Society, Age UK and HelpAge International in signing the letter to the Lancet.
The Lancet letter states: The concept of premature mortality has the potential to undermine cherished, fundamental principles of universality and health as a right for all. Put simply, it tells policy-makers, particularly in poorer countries, that older people do not matter. Last night Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: It is entirely wrong to deny people treatment because of their age, which is why we made it illegal.
This Government is absolutely clear  decisions about care should be based on clinical need.
A ban on age discrimination in NHS services was introduced in 2012. Premature deaths are generally described as those under 75. This is because it is more difficult to determine the cause of death in older people.
Last year, the Royal College of Surgeons warned that elderly people were being denied life-saving operations because of such discrimination.

	The church's review identified 1,885 past cases, which included sexual, physical, emotional and domestic abuse as well as cases of neglect since the 1950s.

Report chairman Jane Stacey, former deputy chief executive of childrens charity Barnardos, called for a culture change in the church. Ministers of religion were in an almost unique position of trust at very vulnerable times in peoples lives, she told Radio 4s Today programme.
Report: The independent review, which has taken three years and was led by former Barnardo's deputy chief executive Jane Stacey, pictured, considered all safeguarding cases for which there were written records
The church commissioned the review, which took three years to complete, because it said it wanted to be open about the past and to have stronger safeguarding procedures in the future.
It received 2,556 responses and identified 1,885 cases, including alleged sexual, physical, emotional and domestic abuse, as well as cases of neglect.
Complaints of sexual abuse accounted for 914 cases and ministers or lay employees were involved in 26 per cent of the alleged cases.
In 61 of these cases there was contact with the police and there are six ongoing police investigations as a result. There were 200 Methodist ministers identified as perpetrators or alleged perpetrators within the report.
It also identified that there was a problem with those working in the Methodist Church being unable to believe or act on allegations against their colleagues. Worryingly, the report revealed that the number of perpetrators has remained consistent over the past 12 years and shows no sign of decline.
One abuse survivor said: I have learnt that it is impossible to recover from sexual abuse when no one recognises the seriousness of it. My church did not want a scandal, my parents did not want a scandal.
I was left to feel worthless and devalued, while the man was left to get on with his life and for all I know repeat the crime with someone else. I was emotionally and physically devastated.
A LIFETIME OF SUFFERING IN SILENCE
Stories of the suffering of victims made up a large section of the report into abuse.
One unnamed man attended a Methodist-founded school and was abused by a teacher who would take him into his private room.
He felt unable to speak about what had happened to him until the report gave him an opportunity to come forward.
I just hated every minute of it, he told the BBC. The teacher involved would come into my dormitory in his dressing gown and shout my name and I would be taken to his room where I was probably there for 15, 20, 25 minutes per time.
I tried to put everything in the back of my mind and disbelieve what happened. Another victim, now in her 50s, told the review she had been groped by a Methodist ministers husband between the ages of 12 and 14. Despite reporting the incident, it seems no action was taken and the man went on to abuse again.
In another case, a Methodist minister who was jailed for sexually assaulting children was allowed to retire on compassionate grounds. The report said: This has caused great offence to his victims.
Many of the cases involved Methodist workers and ministers who were caught molesting young boys or having indecent images and returned to the church to continue the abuse.
Nichola Marshall, head of international abuse at law firm Leigh Day, said: 'It has taken my clients over 30 years to have the courage to come forward with their allegations of abuse against the Methodist Church.
'They welcome this public acknowledgment by the Methodist Church as they have faced criticism and disapproval from members of the community for speaking out in the past.
'It must never again be the case that the reputation of institutions take precedence over the welfare of society's most vulnerable.
'Faith-based organisations have a huge responsibility to ensure the trust they demand of followers is not misused by those who seek out positions of responsibility to prey on the vulnerable.'

The ban is among laws proposed by ministers to fight the trade in potentially deadly legal highs designed to mimic Class A drugs such as cocaine.
Currently, an expert committee must deem new drugs harmful before a ban.
Nitrous oxide  laughing gas has been blamed for 17 UK deaths in recent years. Above, file image
But a Bill published today will presume illegality for any new drug, allowing the prosecution of suppliers. The law will also cover existing psychoactive substances such as nitrous oxide.
Police and councils will also be given the powers to shut down British-based specialist head shops and websites peddling legal highs.
Legitimate sales of laughing gas, which is used in medical and dental operations and for cream whipping machines, will continue to be allowed.

	David Cameron (pictured with French President Francois Hollande yesterday) has been busy this week seeking to prove how serious he is about renegotiating the terms of Britain’s EU membership.

What was encouraging from Mr Hammond yesterday, however, was the clear message that Britain will vote to leave the EU unless other states agree to the Governments reforms.
Most crucially, he did not rule out Mr Cameron himself recommending that Britain should walk away.
It is maintaining this threat  not an accelerated referendum timetable  that will force the eurocrats to start engaging in the truly meaningful negotiations that Britains voters demand.

Take our money back
The farce over Sue Berelowitz  handed a generous 134,000 redundancy deal by the Office of the Childrens Commissioner, only for it to re-hire her immediately as a 960-a-day consultant  deepens.
As we reveal today, the Treasury is investigating this payoff to a woman who, for years, was in politically-correct denial about the links between gangs of Asian men and child sex grooming.
Farce:Sue Berelowitz was handed a 134,000 redundancy deal by the Office of the Childrens Commissioner, only for it to re-hire her immediately as a 960-a-day consultant
But, if found guilty of breaching Whitehall rules on appointments, the OCCs penalty will be a six-figure fine  which, of course, will be funded by the very same taxpayer who stumped up for her redundancy in the first place.
How about demanding the money back from Ms Berelowitz instead  or better still scrapping this pointless, money-devouring quango altogether.

Free Press 1, Fifa 0
As the Fifa corruption scandal threatens finally to engulf Sepp Blatter, its a timely reminder of the value of a free Press  in this case the Sunday Times  which has done so much to expose how rotten footballs governing body truly is.
Huge credit must also go to the US prosecuting authorities, who have taken the lead in charging the Fifa officials accused of taking bribes.
Defiant: Sepp Blatter yesterday insisted he would still seek a fifth term as president of FIFA despite the corruption allegations swirling around world football's governing body
How depressing, however, to find HSBC and Barclays named in the indictments as two of the institutions involved in the transfer of the alleged bungs.
Lift up the rock of almost any scandal and it seems a British bank will be lurking there.

If any other business routinely sold a potentially lethal product, which is inflicting illness on 280,000 people every year, they would be in deep trouble.
Yet, despite a year of warnings that up to three-quarters of shop-bought chickens contain the food poisoning bug campylobacter, many of Britains big supermarkets are yet to convince the Food Standards Agency they are cleaning up their act.
So much for all their slogans about putting the consumer first.

	It was plain to see that to carry out the State Opening with her usual aplomb placed an enormous strain on the Queen, both physically and mentally, writes GEOFFREY LEVY.

But he does not see State papers, sign Government Bills, receive arriving (or departing) ambassadors and High Commissioners, and does not have a weekly meeting with the Prime Minister. The Queen does all of these herself.
No one is aware more than the Queen just how long her son has been waiting to assume the role for which he was born. But her sense of duty wont allow her to step away from any of her responsibilities unless she has to. She is holding on to them as long as she can, says an aide. She feels able to carry on most things, especially while Prince Philip is around to support her.
Active: The Queen was seen enjoying the spring sunshine on a horse ride in Windsor Great Park in April
But is she doing too much?
Certainly, she is admirably active. In April this year, the Queen was seen riding near her Windsor Castle home; the following month, she confidently manoeuvred her Range Rover through the muddy grounds of Royal Windsor Horse Show.
But there are, of course, limitations. Last year, she pulled out of part of a service for knights of the Order of the Bath at Westminster Abbey  following a dress rehearsal, it was reluctantly admitted that negotiating a set of steps in full regalia would be too much.
Not so long ago, to help her continue carrying out investitures, carpenters lowered the dais on which she stands to ease the pressure on her knees when bending down to confer honours. Now comes a further change  the number of people on whom she confers honours is being cut back from 90 a session to 60. This is to ease the heavy physical strain of having to stand, unaided for an average one hour and 45 minutes, to just over an hour. Think of it  more than an hour at the age of 89. Charles, as well as Prince William, now share the investiture load with her.
Royal duties: Prince Charles, accompanied by Camilla, went in place of the Queen to the last gathering of the Commonwealth heads of government - ten flying-hours away in Sri Lanka
And for some time, royal chauffeurs have been instructed to pull up as close as possible to the Queen to minimise her walking.
One thing she has virtually given up  and handed over to younger royals  is far-flung foreign visits. But she has not done so for health reasons. The main reason is that long-distance flying has become increasingly difficult for Prince Philip, without whom she is rarely seen and whose support, she believes, has been crucial to the success of her reign.
She is anxious, says a courtier, for him not to push himself too far.
She has never forgotten how, after she and Philip spent the entire four hours of the Jubilee river pageant on the Thames three years ago on their feet, braving the wet and cold wind on a day that was more November than June, he fell ill and spent some days in hospital.
It was because she didnt want to be without Philip that at the last gathering of the Commonwealth heads of government  ten flying-hours away in Sri Lanka, in 2013  Prince Charles went in her place, accompanied by Camilla.
It also enabled the Prince of Wales to get to know the key Commonwealth political players, and for them to get to know him. This year, when the Commonwealth heads meet in November in Malta, Charles and Camilla will again join the gathering  but so will the Queen and Philip.
There is much more to their decision to attend than the simple fact that Malta is little more than three hours flight time away. For these long-married great-grandparents, flying together to Malta will be a particularly sentimental journey.
And if this is to be the last time Prince Philip makes a lengthy flight with the Queen  as it could well be  it just has to be to Malta.
Their reasons are purely romantic. This was where naval officer Philip was based on the destroyer Chequers between 1949 and 1951 and where he and the then Princess Elizabeth spent some of their happiest days of their early married lives.
Living on the Mediterranean island as a young couple with two small children (Charles was born in 1948, Princess Anne in 1950) was as close as they ever got to living an ordinary life. It has always been a special place for them.
In 2007 en route to Uganda they stopped off at Malta to celebrate their Diamond Wedding. This time they will arrive just a few days after their 68th anniversary, which falls on November 20.
So much for the nostalgia. For the Queen, closing fast by then on her 90th birthday, it will be a working visit as usual, though meeting the Commonwealth leaders has always been one of her favourite duties.
She laughs its like being a doctor, says a friend, seeing four Prime Ministers in the morning and four in the afternoon, and all wanting to tell her about their problems.
As for the State Opening of Parliament, in her 63-year reign the Queen has missed a couple  1959 when she was expecting Andrew, and 1963 when she was pregnant with Edward. On both occasions the Queens speech was read by the Lord Chancellor (latest holder of that office being Michael Gove).
And so she goes on. Good for you Maam  but please, dont overdo it.

A saving of 1billion by the end of March next year would not be a thing you could just swallow and carry on, the source said.
Mr Cameron has already promised not to slash regular troop numbers and has committed to renewing the Trident nuclear deterrent programme.
Finding 1billion in the department could therefore prove difficult and analysts have warned operations overseas could become strained.
The move is likely to infuriate military top brass and many Tory MPs who have repeatedly called for David Cameron (pictured) to commit to spending two per cent of national income on defence
It comes after the Prime Minister was accused of being disingenious earlier this week after claiming Britain would remain at the forefront of efforts to defeat the Islamic State - but made no mention of defence spending in the Queens speech.
Analysts said that such a reduction would make it harder for the prime minister to keep defence spending above the Nato minimum of two per cent of national income.
The U.S is putting pressure on Britain to retain defence spending above this threshold at a time of growing insecurity caused by the rise of Islamic State and the resurgence of an adversarial Russia.
It is expected to be an issue that President Obama will raise with David Cameron when they meet at a G7 summit next month in Germany.

	Today’s edition of You Couldn’t Make It Up comes courtesy of the BBC, which is advertising for disabled weather forecasters, no experience necessary, writes RICHARD LITTLEJOHN.
      </Description>
        <MainBody> VIEW FULL ARCHIVE
Before the usual suspects start squealing with confected outrage, let me make it clear for the umpteenth time that I have no problem with broadcasting organisations reflecting the audience they are supposed to be serving.
Ive written before about my time at London Weekend Television in the mid-Nineties, when my executive producer Trevor Phillips was about the only black face in the building not pushing a broom or working in the canteen.
Things have improved immeasurably over the past 20 years, both on-camera and behind the scenes.
When I worked for the BBC, there were plenty of people with physical handicaps employed there. But they got those jobs because they were talented engineers, producers, computer wizards, or whatever. All of them were hired for their abilities, not because of their disabilities.
The BBCs Gary ODonoghue, currently based in Washington, is a talented political journalist, with years of experience, who just happens to be blind.
Ade ADEpitan and Arthur Williams are part of the Channel 4 Paralympics team because they are polished presenters with a background in competitive sport, not because theyre in wheelchairs.
Taking somebody on simply because they are disabled smacks of the worst kind of tokenism. Its insulting to those people who have bothered to learn their trade.
What message does this advert send to, say, a girl from a Chinese, Nigerian or White British background, come to that, who has spent three years at university obtaining a meteorology degree and hopes to forge a career as a BBC weather presenter?
Must she forget about it because shes not only over-qualified, shes also able-bodied? Thats the problem with the diversity agenda. Theres an ever-shifting hierarchy of victimhood.
Does sexuality trump ethnicity? At the moment, gays seem to be seriously over-represented in a number of areas, including weather forecasting. Should Muslims be promoted ahead of homosexuals, or Afro-Caribbean women ahead of heterosexual white men with disabilities?
And (dont get me started) why are there so many dopey birds wittering on about football and rugby, especially on the BBC? At this rate, it wont be long before Match Of The Day is introduced by a paraplegic Somali transsexual in a burka.
Look, Im all in favour of equal opportunities. Everyone should be able to make the most of their talents and ambitions, regardless of their background.
There are still obvious areas of employment where the cards seem to be stacked against visible minorities. For instance, professional football club owners remain reluctant to hire Black British managers  no matter how distinguished their playing careers.
But theres a world of difference between a level playing field and a system which disregards ability and hard-earned qualifications in favour of candidates who tick the right political boxes.
This latest advert is straight out of the BBCs own, self-parodying series W1A. A recent episode featured a Muslim weatherman with a full Islamic beard who had only been hired to keep the diversity watchdog happy. When he discovers theyre more interested in his beard than his brains, hes absolutely horrified and threatens to walk out.
Actually, when it comes to promoting vulnerable minorities in the field of weather forecasting, the BBC is a long way behind the game. Twenty years ago, L!VE TV, the cable channel run by Kelvin MacKenzie, featured a weather map fronted by a dwarf called Rusty.
Because of his restricted growth, Rusty couldnt reach above Birmingham, so whenever he had to discuss the forecast for Scotland and Northern England he would bounce up and down on a mini-trampoline  until one day he fell off and almost broke his neck while attempting to point to a cold front over Aberdeen.
Having said that, Rustys forecasts  which didnt change from one week to the next  were no less accurate than those of the BBC.
For instance, when I set out for Lords last Saturday morning the local BBC website was predicting warm, dry weather. Before the lunch interval, it had turned bitterly cold, the floodlights were on and the match was held up for two hours because of rain.
The experts ask us to believe them when they insist the Earth will melt in 2050 because of global warming, but they cant even tell us with any degree of certainty whats going to happen today.
So perhaps the BBCs enlightened new recruitment policy makes sense. They might just as well hire a disabled weatherman with no qualifications.
He couldnt do much worse.

WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH, ONLY THE AMERICANS GET GOING
The only surprise about the FIFA story is not that footballs ruling body is riddled with corruption from top to bottom, its that finally some people have had their collars felt. And for that we can thank not the British or European authorities, but the Americans.
The aggressive U.S. prosecutorial system can produce its own miscarriages of justice. But at least theyre not afraid to go after powerful vested interests.
Look at the number of crooked bankers behind bars in America following various financial scandals, compared with the reluctance of the authorities here to bring any charges.
On this side of the Atlantic, our Government is either complacent in the face of wholesale wrongdoing by wealthy institutions  or so close to them that it prefers to turn a blind eye.
The EU itself is as rotten as FIFA, just like all over-blown, self-serving supra-national organisations, including the UN.
Fortunately, because FIFA affiliates are based in Miami and money was allegedly laundered through U.S. banks, the Americans have been able to assert jurisdiction. Thank goodness they have the moral courage and firepower to act, even though FIFAs crimes have minimal impact in the U.S.
The same goes for natural and humanitarian disasters, where the Americans are always first on the scene with aid.
If ever ISIS is to be confronted and destroyed, that will fall to the Americans, too. Already theres a head of steam building up in the U.S. which insists they cant just sit back and watch these barbarians rape and slaughter their way across the Middle East and North Africa.
They know the West is next. The sophisticated European Left may have a visceral and irrational hatred of America.
Yet without the U.S. theyd all be speaking German. Probably inside a concentration camp.
OK, so not all Americas recent interventions have ended well. But they began from the best of intentions. And when push comes to shove, America remains the worlds last best hope.
Who else you gonna call  Vlad Putin?
Its no good expecting Europe to do anything about ISIS  any more than they were prepared to take down FIFA.

A MINUTE'S SILENCE FOR DESMOND THE DUCK
Taking their lead from last weeks candlelit vigil for Bessie the cow in Northumberland, villagers in Somerset are holding a funeral for a duck.
A drake called Desmond, who lived in a pond in Compton Martin for 25 years, was killed by a fox this week, leaving only a pile of feathers behind.
The church flag will be flown at half-mast and locals will hold a wake in the village pub, where they intend to drink whisky laced with duck eggs.
This animal sentimentalism is getting completely out of hand. Wheres it all going to end?
Today, its a wake for a drake. I dread to think whatll happen if someone runs over a lamb in the next few days.
Therell be no stopping the Portashrine crowd.

But the agreement quickly turned to disaster, with Lloyds forced to go to the taxpayer for a 21billion bailout to survive. As angry shareholders counted their losses they called for Sir Victor to be stripped of his knighthood.
Meanwhile, Tory plans to force unions to tell members how their money is spent could cost Labour 25million, it emerged last night.
Sir Victor, a former business ambassador for Gordon Brown, was chairman of Lloyds in 2008 when the credit crunch hit. He is blamed by critics forwrecking the firm following a disastrous business deal
Figures released yesterday reveal the unions gave Labour 50.9million under Ed Miliband, including 10.5million this year.
But this could be slashed by half over the next five years under proposals in the Trades Union Bill that would end the system where unions are able to sign up members to contribute to their political funds without actively seeking their consent. Instead, union members would be asked to opt in.
Evidence suggests the move could cut the number signing up to the political fund by half. A 2013 survey of members of the giant Unite union, Labours biggest donor, found that just 49 per cent support Labour.

Alarming figures suggest one in ten people who have a tattoo experience adverse reactions.
These include swelling and skin irritation, as well as complications which can linger for years.
The research, carried out in the US, is bad news for the rising numbers of Britons who have had a tattoo.
Britain now has one of the highest proportions of tattooed individuals in the world  one in five adults or around 10million, according to the British Association of Dermatologists.
They have been inspired by celebrities such as Angelina Jolie and David Beckham  who has 32 of them. Even Samantha Cameron has a small dolphin inked on the inside of her right ankle.
We were rather alarmed at the high rate of reported chronic complications tied to getting a tattoo, said Professor Marie Leger of New York Universitys Langone Medical Centre.
Given the growing popularity of tattoos, physicians, public health officials and consumers need to be aware of the risks involved.
The minor problems included bacterial infections, skin conditions and itchiness. Others developed edema, which is a form of swelling caused by fluid under the skin. The researchers said that in some cases the coloured portion of the tattoo rose by as much as a centimetre above the skin.
Red ink appeared to be linked with rashes more often than other colours, the US study showed. Such problems were found in six per cent of those who have a tattoo. Four per cent also suffered from chronic problems and complications.
Professor Legers researchers questioned 300 respondents about their tattoos in Central Park in New York.
They ranged in age from 18 to 69, with most having no more than five tattoos. Professor Leger said those who develop problems at first usually go to the tattoo artist where they had the procedure. Less than a third go to the doctor when things go wrong.

	The warning comes from the group Action on Sugar, which found that 85 per cent of 'healthy' fruit snacks are full of sugar, fuelling obesity rates among young children and teenagers.

However, they are so high in sugar they are classed as confectionery under new school nutrition guidelines and so would be banned from tuck-shops.
Action on Sugar picked out Tescos Yogurt Coated Strawberry Fruit Bites, which carries a logo reading Ideal for lunchboxes.
It said a small 25g pack contains 17.5g of sugar, which equates to 4.4 teaspoons.
Packs of yogurt coated Fruit Bowl Fruit Flakes Raspberry Rush are sold as 1 of your 5 a day. However, each 25g pack is made of 17.3g of sugar which equates to 4.3 teaspoons.
The Fruit Factory Sports Mix-Ups are sold with a claim they are made with 75 per cent fruit. However, these had the highest sugar content at 81g per 100g.
Action on Sugar found that 85 per cent of 'healthy' fruit snacks are full of sugar, which is fuelling childhood obesity
All these examples contained more sugar per 100g than a pack of conventional sweets, such as Haribo Starmix, which come in at 47g of sugar per 100g.
Graham MacGregor, of Queen Mary University of London, warned of the pandemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, linked to high sugar intakes, adding: This survey illustrates the fact that the food industry is the cause of this pandemic, by taking something as natural as fruit and ruining it by adding sugar.
Official figures show that one in three children aged 11 to 15 are considered overweight or obese.
Action on Sugars Katharine Jenner said: Parents find it hard enough to know what is healthy without food manufacturers confusing matters with misleading claims.
A Food and Drink Federation spokesman said: Everyone knows fruit contains sugars and the total sugar content of these products is clearly and consistently listed in the nutrition information table. Parents can use this information to compare and choose between products.

A quarter of Brits refuse to smile in 'selfies' and pictures - because they are worried about their teeth looking bad on social media, a survey has revealed.
The study shows a quarter (28 per cent) refuse to smile in pictures to hide their teeth while 81 per cent of us worry about how our teeth look in photographs.
But the research shows that we are far from being a teeth-proud nation.
Of those surveyed, 42 per cent confessed their teeth were the number one thing they would change about themselves and more than a third - 35 per cent - admitted being embarrassed about their teeth
Of those surveyed, 42 per cent confessed their teeth were the number one thing they would change about themselves and more than a third - 35 per cent -admitted being embarrassed about the appearance of their teeth.
And 63 per cent said they wished their teeth were whiter and cleaner.
Sparkling celebrity teeth could be fuelling these feelings of dental inadequacy, as 53 per cent of those polled said they feel pressured to have impeccable teeth because of those displayed by modern celebrities and public figures.
More than 2,000 people were polled in the survey for BUPA.
But the root cause of this anxiety about our teeth could be because Brits are not giving their teeth and gums the proper TLC they need as 47 per cent of respondents admitted they don't know how to brush their teeth properly.

	Andy Burnham, who is seen as a frontrunner in Labour's leadership race, is seeking to position himself as the 'champion' of wealth creation - and claims he will eliminate the deficit if the Tories fail.

The Shadow Home Secretary will start with a breakfast seminar with entrepreneurs before kicking off a nationwide listening tour to hear from Labour members, Labour voters and those who turned away from the party.
Mr Burnhams campaign is suffering because of the impression that he is favoured by the unions  an accusation that dogged Ed Milibands failed leadership.
Mr Burnhams campaign is suffering because of the impression that he is favoured by the unions  an accusation that dogged Ed Milibands failed leadership - and surprising support forLiz Kendall (pictured)
Len McCluskey, general secretary of the hard-left Unite union, has said Mr Burnham is the candidate who impresses him most.
And in his pre-election comments Mr Burnham continually attacked privatisation of the NHS under the Coalition. At the Labour conference he said he would put people before profit.
LABOUR PARTY'S LATEST U-TURN - WILL NOT OPPOSE BENEFITS CAP
Labour has committed another post-election U-turn by saying it will not oppose Conservative plans to slash the benefit cap.
Harriet Harman said her party would accept the pledge to cut the maximum amount a non-working family receives in welfare from 26,000 to 23,000  just days after Labour said it would not oppose plans to hold an EU referendum by the end of 2017.
But within minutes, party splits emerged when a senior backbencher attacked the cap.
Emily Thornberry, the MP forced to resign from Ed Milibands frontbench after tweeting a photo of a house laden with St Georges Cross flags, said there was no evidence the cap helped people find work.
Miss Harman, Labours interim leader, told MPs: We support a cap on benefit entitlement. The Government are planning to reduce it and we are sympathetic to that.
Minutes later, Miss Thornberry said: [The cap] pushes people out  not because 23,000 is not enough for the family to live on, but because it is not enough for their landlords to live on.
However, his revised stance on the partys economic record is at odds with five years ago, when he stood as Labour leader the first time.
Then Mr Burnham told Channel 4 News that the party had to take head on the argument that they left a huge mess.
We both need to defend what we did, which I believe we can, and we then must also set out an alternative course for where we find ourselves, he said.
But speaking to an audience of business leaders at international auditors Ernst &amp; Young in central London today, he will seek to address Labours reputation on economic competence and commit to building the broadest possible alliance for change.
Mr Burnham will say the partys appeal was too narrow, adding: It worries me that, in some peoples eyes, Labour has become associated with giving people who dont want to help themselves an easy ride. That must change before we can win again.
On the deficit, he will say: If we are to win back trust we have to start by admitting that we should not have been running a significant deficit in the years before the crash.
We cant go into the next election, as we did into the last, with business and the public unclear on how Labour will balance the books, or when we will do so.
And he will admit Labour got it wrong on business because the party simply didnt say enough that we value what you do  creating jobs and wealth. Addressing claims he is the union candidate, he will say: I am not someone who is factional but can bring people together.
Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis said: Its the same old faces, peddling the same old failed policies. Labour just cant be trusted with our economy and have no credible plan for Britains future.

	Middle-aged now have the biggest drink problem of all

	A new poll has revealed that middle-aged Britons actually drink far more alcohol than their younger counterparts - and that this group regularly ignore the government's recommended limits.

In contrast to public perceptions that young adults are more risky drinkers in the UK, in fact over the course of the week, their parents generation are drinking more.
The research comes after the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revealed this month that middle-class, middle-aged British women are top of a global league table for alcohol abuse.
Their report warned that as more women delay motherhood, or choose not to have children at all, they are drinking heavily into their thirties, forties and beyond.
According to Drinkaware, nearly half of 45- to 64-year-olds who drank to excess thought that moderate drinking was good for their health.
Around 50 per cent believed they would have no health problems caused by alcohol in later life if they continued to drink at a consistent level. And 59 per cent said they did not want guidance about how to reduce their drinking.
According to Drinkaware, nearly half of 45- to 64-year-olds who drank to excess thought that moderate drinking was good for their health
What are the effects of regularly drinking too much alcohol?
The NHS recommends that men drink no more than 21 units a week  around nine pints of beer  and women no more than 14 units, roughly one and a half bottles of wine. According to the Drinkaware Monitor report, based on a poll of 2,300 adults, a third of middle-aged people risk harming their health by breaching Government guidelines.
The report revealed that 32 per cent of those aged between 45 and 64 regularly drink above the recommended weekly limit. In comparison, just 19 per cent of those aged between 18 and 24 breach the limits. Mrs Hindal said: Our research shows that 45- to 64-year-olds could potentially be sleepwalking into long-term health problems as a result of their drinking patterns.
Regularly drinking above the lower risk limits can increase your tolerance to the short-term effects of alcohol  but not to the strain its putting on your liver.
As your tolerance increases, youre more likely to drink more. This habitual behaviour could also put you at an increased risk of becoming alcohol dependent.
Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the Alcohol Health Alliance, added: I think people are very quick to pick up on the supposed benefits of drinking just small amounts, and are prepared to take a risk by drinking beyond the recommended limits.
This study shows that every decade you go up in age, people are more likely to drink regularly. This is because they have more disposable income, because of availability and because it has become more acceptable to drink at home.
And GP Dr Sarah Jarvis said: Many middle-aged people have a whole social circle of others who also drink to the same levels, so they do not see their drinking as being in any way abnormal  and become more and more resistant to any advice about their drinking.

Ian Mulroy, chairman of campaign body Protect Wyre Group, said: The revelations about Finsbury representing Halite, and the relationship between Finsburys owner and the Secretary of State, is very concerning.
But what is perhaps even more worrying is that we no longer know which minister is going to make that decision. I think DECC should be clear about how the decision will be made, and by whom.
Brother: Roland Rudd, chairs lobbying firm Finsbury, which is representing energy firmHalite Energy Group
A spokesman for Finsbury said: Roland does not discuss energy sector clients of Finsbury with Amber and has certainly never discussed Halite Energy Group with anyone in the Department.
Roland has no involvement whatsoever with the Halite Energy Group account.
The revelations about Finsbury representing Halite, and the relationship between Finsburys owner and the Secretary of State, is very concerning
Campaign body Protect Wyre Group
A spokesman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change said: What needs to be made clear is that the Halite application is one which has already been refused by DECC and the department has been asked to look at it again.
Amber Rudd has declared her interests and they are all in the public domain. And this is a particular decision which will not be decided on by the Secretary of State, so there is no conflict of interest.
A spokesman for Halite Energy said: We have been entirely focused on addressing the few remaining planning issues under consideration, and communicating the local, regional and national economic and energy security benefits of our project.
Such engagement as we have had with DECC regarding the re-determination of the Preesall consent application remains through our lawyers, as is standard practice in such matters.
The Department refused the Halite scheme in 2013, citing geological and safety concerns. The decision was made by a junior minister, not the then Energy Secretary Ed Davey.
But in January last year the energy firm, which says the project will provide up to 345 jobs, won a decision in the High Court to force DECC to look at the issue again.

Graphic artist Massoud Shojaei Tabatabali, head ofthe House of Cartoon, told Press TV they now have plans to hold the exhibition in other countries like Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
'In order to reveal the true nature of ISIL we decided to hold this contest and have people submit their cartoons or caricatures,' he said.
'ISIL tries to associate itself with Islam, but in essence has no idea about Islam.'
The contest, launched in February, focuses on the terror group's horrific crimes, including beheadings, attacks on homosexuals, suicide bombings and the destruction of ancient artefacts.
The artwork will be judged by a team of experts and the winners will be announced on May 31.

	Nepal said they didn't need the three helicopters that have been in India for a month now but will return home without being at all involved in the relief effort after the earthquake last month.

Formerly the RAFs director of defence studies, Air Cdre Lambert said the 100-strong crew alone, including airmen and engineers, sent on the mission would have cost well over 500,000.
Never mind the transportation costs and the loss of Chinooks for a month, he said.
They would have been the ideal aircraft so we were right to offer them. It is disappointing because Im sure they could have done a lot of good. They are a very good workforce so it is a shame they didnt want them.
And the wife of one of the airmen deployed on the mission berated the Nepalese government for turning down such a valuable air asset.
She said: My husband and his colleagues are desperate to help and are completely gutted coming home without doing so.
A woman puts lokta (Nepali Paper) to dry in sunlight at Manthali, Ramechhap, Nepal. Around 10,000 people were killed in the disaster which has prompted offers of aid from all over the world
Knowing he and his crew were not being used for what they were there for is very distressing.
My husband went to Nepal full of pride of honour. The Chinook has many uses and can provide so much help in aid as well as reconstruction and clearing of rubble. They all feel extremely frustrated.
The Chinooks have many uses and to deny entry when they were so close without trying them is disgusting - shame on the Nepalese government - they asked for help, they got it and now changed their minds.
The helicopters were deployed at the end of April hours after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 ripped through the country and killed more than 8,000 people.
But they became stuck at Chandigarh Airbase, north of Delhi, India after the Nepalese government refused to allow them into the country to help.
Number 10 waded into the row after growing impatient with the authorities and after a series of high-level talks a decision was finally made to return the helicopters after Nepal said they are not needed.
Much to the disappointment of the UK government, they were all disassembled for transit, and were this week on their way home back to RAF Odiham by a C-17 military transport aircraft.

The last of the helicopters is due to be back in the UK by Sunday.
Defence sources had dismissed claims the Chinooks would damage buildings and said the heavy-lift helicopters would be able to drop aid from the air and had the expertise needed to assist in the relief effort.
Instead, they said one of the reasons for the block could be due to pressure exerted on Nepal by China and India  who didnt want their aid efforts to be overshadowed by international countries such as the UK.
Nepals infrastructure was badly damaged by the earthquake and destroyed roads has meant little aid has so far reached much of the country  something which the Chinooks would be able to assist with.
The Government said they had been specifically chosen to minimise any risk of damage to surrounding infrastructure, and had been used in similar environments, such as in the Pakistan earthquake in 2005.
But a foreign ministry spokesman for Nepal said the helicopters were too big to land and the government is said to be worried the powerful aircraft will blow roofs of fragile houses or even cause them to collapse when taking off or landing.
There were other suggestions that Nepal blocked the helicopters because the country had overstretched itself and had been overwhelmed with offers of support.
Another suggestion was Nepals army chiefs had put pressure on the Government not to allow the Chinooks in after they were angry over the arrest in the UK of Colonel Kumar Lama of the Nepalese Army.
In 2013 the Nepalese army officer was charged with two counts of torture during his countrys civil war in 2005.

A 79-year-old lawyer has been jailed and struck off after stealing 1million from a farmer's estate to fund his holidays when he was made will executor.
Solicitor John Owen, who was also the coroner for Carmarthenshire, stole 125,000 a year from the estate of a wealthy client to fund his 'extravagant lifestyle'.
He used the money left by farmer John James Williams to prop up his struggling legal practice and even set up a special  'holiday fund'.
The 79-year-old stole the money over eight years andkept sending invoices to Mr Williams' estate up to 14 years after the farmer's death - even though little or no work had been carried out.
He was jailed for five years at Cardiff Crown Court in November last year.
Owen. who has more than 50 years legal experience, has now beenstruck off as a solicitor by the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal.
He admitted 17 charges of false accounting and thefts totalling 1,002,491.85 from the estate of Mr Williams over an eight-year period at an earlier hearing.
Prosecutor Janet McDonald said: 'He was able to get away with it because there was no-one to keep him in check. He was a trusted pillar of the community and a well-known and well-liked figure.
'He maintained an extravagant lifestyle even when the firm was struggling.
'The deceased was a long-standing client of Mr Owen and he was made an executor of his estate.
'Owen would bill for work, charging it to the estate and then taking the money but no work was done at all.'
Owen was arrested after one of Mr Williams' solicitors, Mrs Pauline Mainwaring, contacted them when she saw the money from Mr Williams' estate 'going down at an alarming rate'.

The Russian president said he found it odd that the corruption arrests were carried out at the request of the US and described them as an obvious attempt to derail Mr Blatters re-election.
Before the scandal broke, Mr Blatter, Fifa president for 17 years, had been expected to win about 150 votes from the 209 member football associations.
The African and Asian confederations reiterated their support for him yesterday and pressed for todays election at Fifas annual congress in Zurich to proceed.
South African Football Association spokesman Dominic Chimhavi said: The current president has been a good friend to the continent and hes the right person to lead the federation forward.
Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and Football Association chief Greg Dyke (right) have backed public calls for Blatter to resign and have voiced their support for his rival - Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein of Jordan
Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) has accused the West of meddling in an attempt to take the 2018 World Cup away from hosts Russia anddescribed the arrests as an obvious attempt to derail Blatter
We havent been given enough information to know what has really transpired. We will be sticking to the Confederation of Africa Football resolution [to vote for Blatter].
Mr Blatter attempted to ride out the scandal yesterday as he appeared in public for the first time since the dramatic arrest on Wednesday of seven top Fifa officials. Those held in a dawn raid on a five-star hotel in Zurich included Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb.
The US Department of Justice has charged 18 people over alleged bribes totalling almost 100million paid for television rights, sponsorship deals and World Cup votes.
The indictment alleges South Africa paid 6.5million to disgraced former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner for votes to host the 2010 World Cup  with the money being channelled through a Fifa bank account authorised by an unnamed high-ranking Fifa official.
In a separate development, the Swiss attorney general opened criminal proceedings over the award process that decided who should host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, and will question ten current Fifa executive committee members who voted.

UEFA President Platini: 'Enough is enough, Blatter must go'
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Fifa congress, Mr Blatter denied he could be held responsible for the scandal but warned there could be more bad news to come.
He said: I know many people hold me ultimately responsible for the action and reputation for the global football community, whether it is a decision for the hosting of a World Cup or a corruption scandal. I cannot monitor everyone all of the time  if people want to do wrong, they will also try to hide it.
But Scottish investigative journalist Andrew Jennings, who published corruption allegations against the Fifa president in 2002, claimed on Twitter that Mr Blatter would be drawn into the probe.
He tweeted: I gave the FBI the crucial documents that triggered yesterdays arrests. There will be more to come. Blatter is a target.
Mr Blatter said it was time to restore trust in footballs governing body  comments which will infuriate critics who have said Fifa cannot change while he remains at the helm.
FA chairman Mr Dyke said: There is no way of rebuilding trust in Fifa while Sepp Blatter is still there... He either has to go through a resignation, or he has to be out-voted or we have to find a third way.
Culture, Media and Sport Secretary John Whittingdale said a change in leadership was very badly needed and urged sponsors to review their relationships with the troubled body.
He said a boycott of the 2018 World Cup in Russia was the nuclear option as it would hit fans. Britains Serious Fraud Office was examining the allegations made by US and Swiss authorities, he added. But he said it was too early to say if Englands failed bid to host the 2018 World Cup should be re-run, adding: We should wait and see what the outcome of the investigation is.
Former Uefa president Lennart Johansson said the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar should be reviewed. He suggested the 2018 tournament should be held in England, which bid unsuccessfully to host it.
FURY OF BIG MONEY SPONSORS: MAJOR FIRMS THREATEN TO CUT TIES
FIFAs biggest sponsor, Visa, has threatened to sever ties with footballs governing body over the scandal, saying it may reassess the relationship. Here we list the major sponsors, how much they pay, and what they said yesterday.

Visa  contracted to pay Fifa 30million a year until 2022. Spent almost 1.5million last year on advertising during the World Cup.
Our disappointment and concern with FIFA in light of developments is profound. As a sponsor, we expect Fifa to take swift and immediate steps to address these issues within its organisation ... Should FIFA fail to do so, we have informed them we will reassess our sponsorship.

Adidas  German sportswear company is Fifas oldest sponsor. Its current deal is reported to be worth 95million over the next four years. Last year it spent 6.8million on advertising during the World Cup. The Adidas Group is fully committed to creating a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance... Following todays news, we can therefore only encourage Fifa to continue to establish and follow transparent compliance standards.

Coca-Cola - also has a deal running until the 2022 World Cup. Reportedly worth about 20million a year. Spent 1.25million on advertising during the last tournament.
This lengthy controversy has tarnished the mission and ideals of the Fifa World Cup and we have repeatedly expressed our concerns. We expect Fifa to continue to address these issues thoroughly.

Hyundai  The South Korean car makers deal runs until 2022 and is said to be worth around 11million a year. Last year it spent 1.35million on advertising during the tournament. As a company that places the highest priority on ethical standards and transparency, Hyundai Motors is extremely concerned about legal proceedings being taken against certain Fifa executives.

Budweiser  a sponsor since the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and will still be sponsoring the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. Reported to pay 28million to support the World Cup itself.
We expect all of our partners to maintain strong ethical standards and to operate with transparency.

	First curated in the 1850s by Napoleonic Guard officer, Francois Perrier, the Frog Museum in Estavayer-le-Lac, Switzerland, which boasts 108 stuffed frogs will reopen on May 30.

Apparently, Perrier sought to recreate typical scenes from everyday life in the town, including an electoral banquet, a school classroom and soldiers exercising.
Among the most bizarre in the display is that of a frog inexplicably 'riding' on the back of a squirrel.
One of the oddest elements of the exhibition is this stuffed frog who is inexplicably 'riding' the back of a squirrel
Here, six of the small amphibians are pictured sitting on tiny handcrafted chairs while playing a game of dominos
A woman admires the exhibit of stuffed frogs taking in a school lecture - another of the odd vignettes designed to 'recreate everyday life'
The collection was first curated in the 1850s, when a Napoleonic Guard officer first began collecting frogs on his country walks
The museum in Estavayer-le-Lac, Western Switzerland, has a newly designed exhibition space featuring a collection of 108 stuffed frogs
The officer, Francois Perrier, then brought them home to gut and stuff them, before posing them in painstakingly detailed dioramas
Perhaps what makes this strange museum so compelling is the obvious painstaking detail that Perrier put into reproducing miniature furniture and crafting the tiny accessories, such as the dominos displayed on a tiny table.
The local museum also boasts 200 lamps used by the Swiss railways, as well as a collection of armaments and other items from the town's medieval history.
Most of the collections were privately owned previously and were donated in the early part of the 20th century.
For those intrigued by the unusual displays, entry costs just five Swiss francs for an adult (3.50) and three francs for a child (2).

The following day Pakistani commandos overpowered all the three hijackers in a night operation.
Officials said the executed hijackers were Baluch nationalists who were demanding greater autonomy for they resource-rich but impoverished province.
At the time of the hijacking, officials said that one of the hijackers' demands was for Pakistan not to carry out the nuclear tests which were to due to be carried out in Baluchistan.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a de facto moratorium on the death penalty for those convicted on terrorism charges on 17 December 2014 when Taliban gunmen killed 136 children at an army-run school
Pakistan went on to carry out five underground tests in the Baluchistan desert on 28 May 1998, in response to arch-rival India's second nuclear tests earlier in the month.
Separately on Thursday, a fourth hanging was also carried out, in Karachi jail, the prison official said.
The executed man, Mahmood Ali, had been awarded the death sentence for murdering a three-year-old child in 2003.
A moratorium on the death penalty had been in force in Pakistan since 2008, but executions resumed last December after Taliban militants gunned down 154 people, most of them children, at a school in the restive northwest.
The moratorium was initially lifted only for those convicted of terrorism offences, but in March was extended to cover all capital offences.
The number of people executed since the moratorium was lifted now stands at 131.

Britains Serious Fraud Office is understood to be monitoring the situation and ready to help the US authorities.
Ithas also launched a review into British firms with links to Fifa. These could include banks, sponsors and individuals.
Barclays and HSBC have been named in legal papers filed by the US Department of Justice after millions of dollars in suspect transactions linked to Fifa were allegedly moved through their accounts
If there is any evidence of criminality, the SFO will launch a full investigation.
A source said: The SFO is looking to see whether any of the alleged corruption took place on British soil, by any UK firms or individuals.
In the Commons, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale backed SFO action. I have no doubt they will be looking closely to see if any laws have been broken in this country, he said. In other developments:
 Fifas controversial chief Sepp Blatter faced losing his decades-long presidency in a knife-edge vote later today,
 Visa, Fifas biggest sponsor, threatened to end its 30million-a-year deal unless swift action was taken,
 David Cameron joined growing calls for Mr Blatter to give up his tarnished presidency,
 The European football association, Uefa, threatened a World Cup boycott if Mr Blatter remained in power.
One of the transactions said to involve the British-based banks and linked either to Fifa or its officials and connected companies was the transfer of more than 320,000 to the account of a luxury yacht manufacturer in London, while another was a 130,000 payment which was switched through Barclays New York branch to an account in the Cayman Islands tax haven.
If the banks are implicated in any corruption, or if they failed to carry out stringent checks, it will bring further shame on Britains financial service industry  and potentially heavy fines.
Documents also show that international accountancy firm KPMG is at the heart of the scandal.

It faces tough questions over why it has been giving Fifas accounts a clean bill of health for years despite widespread corruption allegations hanging over the organisation.
PRAISE FOR THE FREE PRESS 
Culture Secretary John Whittingdale praised the role of investigative journalists in exposing the corruption scandal at Fifa.
He cited the investigation into Fifa by the Sunday Times in a statement in the House of Commons yesterday.
Mr Whittingdale said: I would like to pay tribute to the Insight team of the Sunday Times, without whose investigations many of these allegations may never have come to light.
The Sunday Times has led the charge on exposing corruption within Fifa, analysing hundreds of millions of documents leaked to the newspaper by a whistleblower to discover deeply worrying details about the Qatari bid for the 2022 World Cup.
MPs also praised the BBC Panorama programme for its Fifa investigations.
A KPMG spokesman said: As Fifas statutory auditor, we are bound by professional confidentiality and have to refrain from any comment.
US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said that those who conspired with the 14 who have been charged include businessmen, bankers and other trusted intermediaries who laundered illicit payments.
The 14 are understood to include nine current and former Fifa officials and five sports marketing officials.
Laundering is where cash received from bribes is made to look legitimate by being pumped through reputable lenders. Banks are supposed to go through a series of checks when handling large sums, to make sure they are not dealing with dirty money.
The Department of Justice has listed a string of suspicious transactions in documents it released this week.
Many relate to Traffic, a sports marketing company belonging to Aaron Davidson, who is one of the accused.
Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered declined to comment.

For centuries it has been a storage area for a growing collection of statues, furniture and memorials. But work is now underway to transform the 13th century Triforium in Westminster Abbey into a new public viewing and gallery in central London.
Photographs taken today show specialist removal workers using a winch to carefully lower  artefacts from the medieval space - which runs 70 feet above the floor of the Abbey - ahead of renovations inside.
Once completed, the 19million space will exhibit a number of historical objects from the church -including royal funeral effigies, silverware and stonework - and give visitors impressive views down over its buildings.
The new gallery, which is due to open in 2018, will be accessible from a new stair and lift tower at the east end of the church. This will be the Abbeys most significant addition since 1745, providing entry to what will be called The Queen's Diamond Jubilee Galleries.
The Abbey, which has been the setting for every coronation since 1066, has also held 16 royal weddings - including the Cambridges' in 2011. It holds the largest collection of figure sculpture from early Tudor England, with 96 of the original 107 from the 16th century still remaining.

Imagine being able to 'unlearn' racism and gender prejudice during a short nap.
That's what scientists claim can happen when simple noises are played while people sleep.
In a new study, researchers were able to significantly reduce prejudice in those who underwent the a unique type of training while snoozing.

Participants were shown female faces with words linked to maths or science.During the tasks, sounds were played that came to be strongly associated with the gender pairs.Participants took a 90 minute nap. Once they entered a deep sleep, one of the sounds was played repeatedly
HOW WAS IT DONE?
Participants were first shown female faces with words linked to maths or science.
They were also shown black faces that were linked with pleasant words.
During the tasks, two sounds were played - one that came to be strongly associated with the gender pairs and the other with the race pairs.
Participants then took a 90 minute nap. Once they entered a deep sleep, one of the sounds was played repeatedly.
Before the nap, peoples bias had fallen, but without the sounds during sleep, their level of bias had gone back to baseline after the nap.
But when participants were played the sound cues during sleep, their bias scores reduced by a further 56 per cent.
Their scores remained reduced by around 20 per cent compared to their initial baseline when the participants were tested a week later.
The findings confirm the idea that sleep provides an opportunity to access deep-rooted beliefs, such as prejudices, that we may not even know we have.
Xiaoqing Hu, who led the study at Northwestern University, said that even he was surprised by the results.
'The usual expectation is that a brief, one-time intervention is not strong enough to have a lasting influence,' he said.
'It might be better to use repeated sessions and more extensive training. But our results show how learning, even this type of learning, depends on sleep.'
Earlier studies by the Northwestern researchers have revealed memory reactivation during sleep.
Generally, participants first heard distinctive sounds during a learning session. A short period of sleep came next.
After people woke up, what they could remember was changed if learning-related sounds were presented during sleep.
'We call this Targeted Memory Reactivation, because the sounds played during sleep could produce relatively better memory for information cued during sleep compared to information not cued during sleep,' said Ken Paller, senior author of the study and professor of psychology.
'For example, we used this procedure to selectively improve spatial memory, such as learning the locations of a set of objects, and skill memory, like learning to play a melody on a keyboard.'
The current study was designed to apply the same sort of procedure to counter-stereotype training.

Some French men and women confessed that they shower only once every four days - that is just once in a week - according to the international study
Four in ten French people have admitted that they do not shower every day and a further 11 per cent wash just once every three days, a new survey has revealed.
Some French men and women even confessed that they shower only every four days - that is just once in a week - according to the study by polling organisation BVA.
Fewer than two-thirds of the countrys population shower daily.
French industries lose an estimated 10billion per year because employees have to spend time cleaning up after others in dirty lavatories or searching for clean toilets.
In France, we have a hard time admitting that poor hygiene is a factor linked to illness, said Virginia Mallet, head of hygiene company Initial France, who commissioned the research.
She added: The simple act of washing ones hands after going to the toilet is automatic in some countries, but in France we have always underestimated this act.
British people beat other major European markets, including Germany, Spain and France, in their weekly bathing habits, according to 2014 Euromonitor International research.
The UK also trumped Russians, Americans and Australians.

The judgement marks the end of the 'Bettencourt Affair,' as it has been dubbed in France, a politico-financial scandal that wound its way through French courts and newspapers for years, and only this year came to trial.
It began in 2007, when Bettencourt's daughter accused the photographer of manipulating her elderly mother into giving him artwork, cash and other favours worth hundreds of millions of euros.
Banier, godfather to Johny Depp's daughter, is said to have done all he could to make Mrs Bettencourt appoint him as her sole heir, the court heard.
The trial centred around a feud between billionaire heiress Mrs Bettencourt (pictured) and her daughter Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers
He met Mrs Bettencourt in 1987, and the heiress took him under her wing, lavishing him with life insurance funds and millions in cash.
Banier, who owns two flats in Paris, two properties in Marrakesh, Morocco, and another in the south of France, told the court he had assets and money 'well before knowing Liliane Bettencourt.'
'She found pleasure in giving the money,' he said, adding that Bettencourt was in no way diminished mentally when he knew her.
Banier, who owns two flats in Paris, two properties in Marrakesh, Morocco, and another in the south of France, told the court he had assets and money 'well before knowing Liliane Bettencourt.'
Judges ruled that Banier had exercised 'real psychological and moral control' over his elderly 'friend'.
The trial - which was rocked from the beginning when one of  the accused, Alain
Thurin
, had attempted to commit suicide the day before it started - centred around a feud between Mrs Bettencourt and her daughter Francoise
Bettencourt Meyers
that grew into a complex web of betrayal and dodgy dealings involving close to a dozen people.
It also involved a butler's betrayal, advancing dementia, unscrupulous friends and cash-filled envelopes for senior politicians.
The case eventually widened to include 10 defendants, including some of Mrs Bettencourt's closest advisers and staff who stood accused of taking advantage of the elderly widow.
Mrs Bettencourt was placed under the guardianship of one of her grandsons four years
ago,
after she was diagnosed with dementia.
Many expected former president  Sarkozy to have been dragged into proceedings, but he was cleared of any
wrong doing
last year.
Potential charges of tax evasion against Mrs Bettencourt were also dropped.
This was despite prosecutors accusing Mr Sarkozy's lieutenants of illegally accepting brown envelopes full of cash from Mrs Bettencourt in order to fund his election campaign in 2007.
French authorities also ordered Mrs Bettencourt to pay back some 86 million in unpaid taxes after allegedly trying to hush up her purchase of an entire island in the Seychelles.

	A Food Standards Agency survey revealed 19 per cent of chickens in British supermarkets were found to contain the highest rate of the bug, which affects an estimated 280,000 people a year.

Around one in five birds, or 19 per cent, were contaminated at the highest and most risky level.
More than one in 20 carried the bug on the outside of packs, which means simply lifting them off the shelf could put shoppers at risk.
Asda had a higher-than-average incidence of chicken contaminated at the highest level, while Tesco was the only supermarket to fall below the industry average
Campylobacter is the most common cause of food poisoning in Britain, responsible for some 280,000 infections a year and 100 deaths. The cost is put at 900million in terms of NHS treatment and lost productivity caused by people being off work sick.
HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF
The FSA is advising consumers to protect themselves by storing raw chicken separately from other food.
Shoppers should keep it covered and chilled on the bottom shelf of the fridge, it said.
Consumers should also not wash raw chicken as this splashes the germs on to surfaces.
Everything that has touched raw chicken should be washed in soap and hot water, including hands and utensils.
Home cooks should also check chicken is cooked properly until it is steaming hot throughout with no pink meat and the juices run clear.
The FSA named Asda, Britains second biggest supermarket, as the worst offender with a contamination rate of 80.4 per cent across the 12 months. However, others were little better.
The watchdog has told all the supermarkets it expects them to deliver big cuts in contamination levels to protect public health.
It has set a target of no more than one in ten chickens being contaminated at the highest level. But its figures show that not one store has yet managed to meet this.
When the FSA began its survey in February last year, the proportion of birds that were contaminated was 53.1 per cent. This rose to 74.1 per cent in tests carried out in February this year, giving an average of 73 per cent for the year.
Experts believe the increase may have something to do with the relatively mild and wet weather this year, which encourages the spread of the bug. Professor Brendan Wren said the situation is so serious that radical action is needed to keep campylobacter out of the food chain, including the development of a vaccine to immunise the national flock.
Food Standards Agency: 'The truth about campylobacter'
The FSA estimates that 280,000 people fall ill with the UK's most common cause of food poisoning each year. Most recover after two or three days of stomach problems, however the bug can cause complications, including paralysis and even death with some 100 fatalities a year
Professor Wren, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: It is a national scandal that we readily accept such a toxic food poisoning organism into our kitchens.
The FSA advises home cooks to avoid touching the skin of the chickens and to cook the birds thoroughly. However this is not a guarantee against catching the bug.
Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at Liverpool University, said: The biology of this bug make its control extremely difficult.
Whilst a few hundred bacteria can make someone ill, chickens may carry many millions of the bug with relatively little disease.
He said that all types of chicken, including organic and free range, are just as likely to be infected.
The FSA has praised a number of retailers  particularly Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose, Morrisons and the Co-op  for introducing regimes that are reducing contamination levels and said it expected other supermarkets to follow them.
The benefits of these changes came too late to be captured in the FSAs survey, which involved testing more than 4,000 chickens.
Last week Asda announced an action plan to tackle the bug. This involves blasting its chickens with steam and ultrasound.
Along with most other supermarkets, it is also moving to sell chicken in roast in the bag packs.
Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, which speaks for the stores, said: Retailers continue to invest with suppliers in practical solutions that will make a real difference in tackling this issue. While it remains a challenge, we are determined to find a solution as quickly as possible.

	Elfin Yvette has given her flat vowels a dab of polish, QUENTIN LETTS writes

	Any opposition leader needs to be able to command the Commons Chamber and Miss Cooper has given us a glimpse of just how she might do that with a strong, poetic, and almost Cockney speech.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share this article

Instead we had a crescendo, a deepening of tone, a lifting of lower jaw: We will stand up for human rights, responsibility and respect for our common humanity!
She had put effort into this speech, not just the writing (normal Yvette speeches do not contain words such as bulwark) but also the delivery. She varied pace and volume with the skill of a von Karajan or Rattle. And that accent, I swear, was ever so slightly different.
Acting leader: Yvette Cooper has changed her style as she hopes to lead Labour after election defeat
It was less jagged in the vowels, less astringent, not quite Cockney but flattish in a south-east England commuter-belt way.
The coming Labour election may officially be about the partys leadership but it may also be about the north-south divide, a battle for the soul of the Labour movement between the forward-looking South and a northern Labour which bangs on about coal miners and the bedroom tax.
Labour must reconnect with middle-income voters south of Chester. Are senior Labour figures starting to realise that it has been sounding a mite too Mancunian/Scouse/Geordie in recent years? They projected an idea of northern England as some sort of impoverished, victimised Coronation Street set. It not only irked voters in the southern English shires but also allowed the Tories to paint a more optimistic notion of the North with their powerhouse.
Hence, perhaps, the subtly modulated Cooper accent yesterday. It sounded more grown-up, less plaintive. An improvement.
She did not quite conquer her opposite number, Theresa May. When Mrs May rose and asked Miss Cooper to name the right level for net immigration, we had a sound of whistling emptiness and Labours Keith Vaz had to come to Miss Coopers rescue.
Her peroration about how the Tories, with their Euroscepticism, were turning our country inwards, making it a smaller, narrower, darker place, deserved the groans and mockery it received from the handful of Conservatives who were in attendance. Yet with her teasing of Mrs Mays fraught relations with the new Justice Secretary, Michael Gove, Miss Cooper scored plenty of runs and there were grudging compliments to her not only from the SNPs Angus MacNeil (Western Isles) but also the Tories Richard Fuller (Bedford). Were I a Labour MP, I might not have been quite converted but I would have been assured.
Labour will seek to re-establish some prominence in the Houses of Parliament with strong performances from high-profile politician like Yvetter Cooper in the chamber

	The 33-year-old man claimed to be the Duke of Marlborough when he checked in to the luxury Great Northern Hotel in King's Cross, north London, and allegedly racked up a £1,800 bar bill.

A receptionist at the hotel - where a night's stay can cost up to 325 - refused to comment on the incident which occurred in  the early hours of this morning. She said: 'We are not at liberty to speak about it.'
The alleged con resembles the plot in an episode of Fawlty Towers - the iconic 1970s comedy starring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.
The pilot episode, called 'A Touch of Class', follows Basil as he tries to raise the tone of the hotel as the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.
Basil starts fawning over his Lordship, ignoring the rest of his guests and even cashing dodgy cheques for him, until workers discover the man is actually a fraudster.
The alleged con resembles the plot in the pilot episode of Fawlty Towers - the iconic 1970s comedy starring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty - where a fraudster claimed to bearistocratic Lord Melbury (pictured above)
The Great Northern Hotel was designed by Victorian master builder Lewis Cubitt and first opened its doors in 1854.
It describes itself on its website as 'magnificently refurbished' and the 'finest luxury boutique hotel in London'.
It adds: 'Exquisitely re-designed to evoke all the glamour and grace of this iconic building's extraordinary past, there is no boutique hotel in London more elegant.'
The man currently remains in custody.
FRAUDSTER CONS BASIL FAWLTY BY POSING AS LORD IN ICONIC SITCOM
The alleged fraud is similar to an episode of theiconic 1970s comedy Fawlty Towers, which starred John Cleese as Basil Fawlty.
The pilot episode, called 'A Touch of Class', follows Basil as he tries to raise the tone of the hotel as the aristocratic Lord Melbury comes to stay at the hotel.
Basil starts fawning over his well-dressed Lordship, ignoring the rest of his guests and even cashing dodgy cheques for him, after becoming infatuated by his air of class.

Polly (right) discovers thatLord Melbury is in fact a fraud and a confidence trickster and breaks the news to Basil and his wife Sybil (centre). The man claiming to be Melbury is  ordered out of the hotel and arrested
However, all is not as it seems and hotel worker Polly Sherman - played by Cleese's real-life ex-wife Connie Booth - discovers thatLord Melbury is in fact a fake.
She makes the discovery after going into Torquay - the town where the comedy is set - and bumping into local policemen who inform her they have been watching Melbury.
He is revealed to be a confidence trickster pulling off a large scam in the town.
Polly later returns to the hotel and informs Basil he has been duped. The fraudster posing as Melbury is frogmarched out of the hotel and later arrested by police.
Fawlty Towers was a BBC sitcom which ran in the 1970s. Only two series - a total of 12 episodes - of the hit-show were ever made, being aired for the first time in 1975 and 1979 respectively.
The series was set in Fawlty Towers, a fictional hotel in the seaside town of Torquay, in the 'English Riviera' of south Devon.
It has previously been named several times as one of the best British television series of all time.

An estimated 166,000 children die each year around the world as a result of second-hand smoke - usually due to respiratory tract infections.
Dr Carlos Jimenez-Ruiz, from the European Respiratory Society said: The findings of this new study add more weight to the argument that smoke-free legislation is a valuable tool in reducing the health harms of smoking, particularly in children.
We must use this evidence to increase awareness and knowledge among policy makers of the harm caused by tobacco and the value of legislation designed to reduce this harm.
The findings were last night welcomed by health charities.
Mike Hobday, director of policy at the British Heart Foundation, said: These research findings provide more evidence of the health benefits of legislation to reduce the impact of smoking, specifically for young people.
But the job is not done. We want to see the new Government take further action on smoking, including an annual levy on tobacco companies to fund tobacco control and stop smoking services to help support people to quit.
We believe that the forthcoming introduction of standardised tobacco packaging will provide further benefits by helping to stop young people taking up smoking. Cigarette packets will no longer be the Pied Piper luring children towards this deadly habit.
Scientists found the smoking ban was followed by an immediate reduction of 13.8 per cent in the number of admissions for lower respiratory tract infections
Dr Nick Hopkinson, honorary medical adviser for the British Lung Foundation, said: This research again demonstrates the real and measurable impact the smoking ban has had on protecting childrens lungs.
While passive smoking is bad for everyone, children are especially vulnerable to the effects of second-hand smoke as their lungs are smaller and are still developing.
The reduction in hospital admissions was particularly marked in children from poorer backgrounds, so we can see that smoke-free legislation is helping to reduce inequalities in health.
We now look forward to the implementation in October of the ban on smoking in cars carrying children. Every child protected from exposure to second-hand smoke is a victory, and this law will be a significant further milestone for public health.

The prisoner, whose face and upper body are covered in cuts and bruises, is first made to speak to the camera 'admitting' his wrongdoings.
Speaking in Arabic, he says he is fromAl-Qaryatayn, a town in central Syria, and describes his work as a spy.
He concludes: 'I killed Abu Hassan and the Islamic State came and captured me.'
The captive, who gives his name as Ziad Abdelal Abu Tarek, is filmed walking barefoot in an orange jumpsuit across barren land to a pick axe and shovel, before digging the grave.
A white truck pulls up behind him bearing the recognisable black ISIS flag, and the footage then cuts to a shot of him kneeling on the ground in front of his executioner. The video also shows the aftermath of the barbaric killing.
Last week, shocking images emerged showing decapitated bodies strewn across blood-filled streets in Palmyra, close to Al-Qaryatayn after ISIS stormed the ancient city.

This is the heartwarming moment a baby fox was cut free by rescuers after its head became stuck in a plastic bottle.
Animal rescuers were called after concerned residents in Eastbourne, East Sussex, found the seven week old cub running around with its head wedged in the tub.
Members of the East Sussex Wildlife Rescue and Animal Service (WRAS) searched for the animal, after local people showed them a video of the stricken animal.

Two ambulances were also sent to the area to search for the young fox and as daylight appeared the rescuers continued to search the bushes in Woodgate Road.
Eventually, the cub was discovered when rescuers spotted a young fox after seeing movement in the bushes.
Kathryn Martyn, partner of the WRAS founder, Trevor Weeks, said: 'We didn't want to give up, as we were concerned the cub might develop breathing problems and was probably already becoming hungry and dehydrated.

Rescuers had to use scissors to carefully remove the jar from the fox's head, after there were fears it would have trouble breathing
The cub was checked over by WRAS vet Mike Symons at WRASs Casualty Centre and was then bedded for the night to recuperate
'We knew the longer we left the fox the worse the condition of the cub would become. There was a chance the fox could be dead by morning.'
Whiile Mr Riddington added: 'We used torches to help pin point where the cub was.
'Trevor was hidden in the darkness so the cub couldn't see him and luckily it ran straight towards him where he was able to catch him in a net.'
The cub was placed in a carrier and taken back to WRASs veterinary ambulance to have the plastic container removed.
A hole was cut at the end to help with breathing and then bandage scissors were used to cut the tub.

WRAS founder Mr Weeks explained: 'The top of the tub where a lid screws on was quite thick plastic and difficult to cut.
'We had had to use bandage scissors to cut the plastic and we also be careful that not to injure the cub as we were cutting.
'I then assessed the cubs neck for swelling and any other injuries, signs of infection as well as fly eggs and maggots. The cubs head certainly didn't smell nice.'
The cub was checked over by WRAS vet Mike Symons at WRASs Casualty Centre and was then bedded for the night to recuperate.
Mr Weeks added: 'Luckily the wounds were not too serious and we hope it will be a quick recovery so the cub can get back to its mum.'
The fox cub is currently at WRASs Casualty Care Centre receiving treatment.

Women have been barred from driving in Saudi Arabia since the establishment of the state in 1932 and last year a woman reportedly received 150 lashes after being caught behind the wheel.
In December two women's rights campaigners who tried to drive into Saudi Arabia were told they would face a special 'terrorism' court for flouting the ban on women motorists.
In London Belz sect members run at least two large schools in north London, which educate hundreds of young Jews.
Talmud Torah Machzikei Hadass and Beis Malka are rated 'good' by Ofsted. 
Despite some rabbis backing the ban the Jewish Chronicle says that several of their wives do drive.
One woman, who asked not to be named, said the proposal 'disables women' because 'the more kids they have, the more they need to drive'.
And of the rabbis she said: 'They say one thing, they do another'.
Home: There are Belz synagogues in north London, pictured, and some of the group's rabbis have backed calls for women not to drive
Last year another sect caused anger in the Stamford Hill area when an orthodox Jewish group organised a religious parade but demanded men and women walk on different sides of the road.
Belz Rebbe is an ancient Polish-Jewish dynasty which has its roots in the 14th Century in the Polish town of the same name, and is one of the main Hasidic sects.
Hasidic Jews wear clothes similar to that worn by their ancestors in 18th and 19th century Europe - and this style of attire is also said to help them to focus on their sense of tradition and spirituality.
They set up their headquarters in Israel after the Second World War and in 2013 the wedding of the group's leader's grandson was attended by 25,00 guests.
The biggest communities outside Israel are found in the United States, England, Belgium and Australia.
Their lives revolve around religious study, prayer and family - and many live without television, films, the internet or secular publications.
The men generally have beards and sidelocks (peyot) and women tend to wear long skirts and shirts with long sleeves and high necklines as they adhere to strict guidelines of modesty.
After the women get married, they cover their heads with either scarves, hats or wigs, known as 'sheitels'.
THE ORTHODOX ARISTOCRACY: HOW THE BELZ DYNASTY WAS FOUNDED
The Belz orthodox sect has thousands of members worldwide
The founder of the dynasty was Rabbi Shalom Rokeach, also known as the Sar Shalom, who was inducted as the rabbi of Belz in Poland in 1817m and now
He personally helped build the city's large and imposing synagogue which stood until the Nazis invaded Belz in late 1939.
When Rabbi Shalom died in 1855, his youngest son, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, became the next Rebbe. The Belzer Hasidism sect grew in size during Rebbe Yehoshua's tenure and the tenure of his son and successor, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach.
Unlike other groups which formed yeshivas in pre-war Poland, Belz maintained a unique yoshvim program, developed by Rabbi Yissachar Dov, which produced many outstanding Torah scholars. The yoshvim were married and unmarried men who remained in the synagogue all day to study the Talmud, pray, and derive inspiration from their Rebbe.
With the outbreak of World War II and the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939, the town of Belz was thrown into turmoil. From 1939 to 1944 it was occupied by Nazi Germany as a part of the General Government.
Though the Germans attempted to destroy the Belz synagogue first by fire and then by dynamite, they were unsuccessful. Finally they conscripted Jewish men to take the building apart, brick by brick.
The Belz leader Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, known as the 'Wonder Rebbe' was at the top of the Gestapo's 'wanted list' of rabbis targeted for extradition and extermination during the Nazi occupation of Poland.
With cash inflow from Belzer Hasidim in Palestine, England and the United States, the Rebbe and his half-brother, Rabbi Mordechai of Bilgoray, managed to stay one step ahead of the Nazis in one miraculous escape attempt after another. The brothers were driven out of occupied Poland and into Hungary by a Hungarian counter-intelligence agent who was friendly to Jews.
Although he had lost his entire familyincluding his wife, children, grandchildren and in-laws and their familiesto the Nazis, Rebbe Aharon re-established his Hasidic court in Tel Aviv, where there was a small Hasidic community.
Both he and Rabbi Mordechai (who had lost his wife and daughter) remarried, but only Rabbi Mordechai had a child, Yissachar Dov Rokeach (II), in 1948. Rabbi Mordechai suddenly died a year later at the age of 47. Rebbe Aharon took his brother's son under his wing to groom him as the future successor to the Belz dynasty.
Like nearly all of the other groups originating in Poland, Belzer Hasdism was nearly wiped out by the Holocaust. Some Hasidic followers from other communities joined Belz after the war and following the deaths of their rebbes. Belz, like Ger and Satmar, was comparatively fortunate in that its leadership remained intact and survived the war, as opposed to many other Hasidic groups which suffered losses both in terms of rank-and-file supporters, as well as the physical decapitation of their leaders.
Rebbe Aharon became an acknowledged leader of Haredi Judaism in Israel. He laid the groundwork for the spread of Belzer Hasidism through the establishment of schools and yeshivas in Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak and Jerusalem.
Since 1966, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach has presided over both the expansion of Belz educational institutions and the growth of Hasidic populations in Israel, the United States, and Europe. Under the Rebbe's leadership, the Belz Hasidut has grown from a few hundred families at the time of his accession to leadership in 1966, to over 7,000 families as of 2011.

	FIFA president, Sepp Blatter, 79, stepped out with girlfriend Linda Barras, 51, as they attended FIFA Congress Opening Ceremony at the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland.

The fluted skirting served to flatter the brunette's figure, and the dress was paired with modest pointed courts.
Linda added glamorous touches with drop diamond earrings, a smoky eye, as well as a small black box clutch.

The duo were amongst other powerful officials during the opening ceremony at theHallenstadion
The pair looked comfortable as they made their way in to theHallenstadion, surrounded by bodyguards.
Taking their seats, the unlikely couple chatted, also taking time to speak to officials such as Swiss Sports Minister Ueli Maurer and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach.
In January of last year, Linda Barras' husband, estate owner, Christian Barras publicly responded to stories circulating in the Swiss press about his wife's alleged relationship with the FIFA boss.
At the time, the pair had been legally married for 16 years, after tying the knot in 1998, and Linda is also the mother of their two children.
The couple had reportedly known football giant Sepp Blatter for several years.
When asked about Linda's relationship with Sepp, Christian told the press last year: 'I know nothing about this. Im still married to Linda.'

He added: 'She is a friend of the niece of Sepp Blatter.'
Blatter, who has been dubbed The Most Powerful Man in Football, has been married three times and has one daughter, Corinne, who is mother to his granddaughter, Serena.
Over the last year, Sepp and Linda have been repeatedly pictured together, with Swiss tabloids often claiming that Linda and Sepp are in a relationship.
The couple attended the very same64th FIFA Congress Opening Ceremony this time last year, with Linda stepping out in a similarly glamorous get-up of a bodycon monochrome dress and platform heels.
Staying close: The pair were inseparable as they made their way around the auditorium
Linda boasted a beaming smile as she looked the image of glamour next to her reported partner Sepp Blatter
The pair were escorted in to the venue by bodyguards, as they took to the red carpet together
At one point in the ceremony, Sepp stood up to make a speech, rejecting calls for his resignation from the Fdration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), having been the president since June 1998.
Currently, the international governing body is facing a corruption scandal, with seven officials having already been arrested over charges ofracketeering, fraud and money laundering.
Pleas have been made for Sepp to resign, following warnings from sponsors and political leaders.

	Valeria Guryeva, who is the wife of Andrey Guryev Jr - the son of a 57-year-old billionaire and owner of London's largest private house who goes by the same name - claims she is ‘too pretty for work’.

Her declarations come after it was revealed that her mother-in-law, Evgenia Guryeva, earned more in one year than 10 of the wealthiest Kremlin wives put together.
She owns a stable of classic and luxury cars, including two Rolls-Royces once belonging to Elton John, according to a family friend.
Valeria (left) is married tobillionaire Andrey Jr (right), who is the chief executive officer of OAO Phosagro - a global fertiliser producer. Andrey Jr is also the son of Russia's28th richest man, billionaire Andrey Guryev
Russian oligarch Andrey Guryev reportedly owns Witanhurst (pictured), which is Londons largest and most expensive private house. When complete, it will spread over 90,000 square feet and will be worth 300million
Evgenia and her fertiliser tycoon husband Andrey Guryev - Russias 28th richest man, with a fortune of 2.6billion  also apparently own Witanhurst, a 25-bedroom mansion in Highgate, north-west London.
According to the Evening Standard , Evgenia earned 14million (709.2 million roubles) in 2012, while her husband took home just 290,000 (14.7 million roubles) in declared income.
Their London mansion, which comes with a 70ft-long ballroom and the yellow, blue and gold ceiling of which took six months to paint, will spread over 90,000 square feet when it is fully refurbished.
It will be second in size only to Buckingham Palace and is likely to become the most expensive house in London, with an estimated value of 300million and neighbours including Kate Moss.
The Georgian Orangery, a three-storey addition, also comes complete with a basement featuring massage rooms, a gym and a swimming pool fit for Olympic athletes.
Valeria's father-in-law isAndrey Guryev (left) - afertiliser tycoon who apparently bought the25-bedroom Witanhurst mansion in north-west London in 2008 for 50million. The property is now worth six times that
Witanhurst is likely to be the most expensive London house and is only beaten in size by Buckingham Palace
Mystery surrounded its ownership since it was sold in 2008 for 50million and registered to a shell company, Safran Holdings, in the British Virgin Islands.
However, earlier this week - after years of speculation by neighbours - British writer Ed Caesar claimed it was snapped by the Guryev family.
Writing in The New Yorker magazine, Mr Caesar said the complicated connections linking Mr Guryev to the house - which was used in the BBC reality show Fame Academy  helped to obscure and protect his Russian assets and reputation.
According to Mr Caesar, Mr Guryev visited Witanhurst - which was built between 1913 and 1920 - days before its sale in 2008 and revealed he planned to use the mansion to house at least two generations of his family.

Teaching Assistant Louise Aspinall is accused of having sex with a 13-year-old schoolboy
A mother was left 'distraught' after discovering her 13-year-old son had allegedly been having sex with a married teaching assistant, a court heard.
Louise Aspinall, 36, a mother- of-two, is accused of having sex with the boy on three separate occasions while she was working at Swinton High School in Salford, Greater Manchester.
She denies seven counts of sexual activity with a child.
Today the boy's mother told the jury at Manchester Crown Court she had had 'suspicions' something was not right.
She was called into school by the head teacher in December 2013, after rumours began circulating about Mrs Aspinall and the youngster following the alleged offences over a number of weeks, earlier that year in February and March.
The boy's mother said at first her son denied anything had happened but later, after going to police, said he had been having sex with the teaching assistant, who was having marital difficulties at the time.
The boy and his mother cannot be identified for legal reasons.
'I was in quite a bit of shock. I knew something was weird but I did not know exactly what,' the teenager's mother told the jury.
'It was a shock to find that out, even though I knew something was not right. I was distraught.
'I was confused and I was upset but from the suspicions I had, soon as I heard what was going on I knew, 'Oh God, this was why I felt it was so weird.''
Earlier, prosecutor Andrew MacKintosh told the jury Mrs Aspinall and the complainant had sex on three separate occasions and she also performed sex acts on him.
She is said to have first kissed the boy when they wrestled over a mobile phone after being left alone together.
The teenager decided to keep quiet about the kiss, but the following week she took his virginity in her own marital bed, it was claimed.
Afterwards the boy relaxed by playing on an Xbox.
The secret liaisons included sex in Mrs Aspinall's marital bed at her home in Salford and on St Valentine's Day, it is alleged.
The jury heard that the boy said Mrs Aspinall never forced him to have sex but following their first alleged tryst, the boy claims she said: Obviously dont tell anyone. I can get in trouble for it.
Aspinall told police the claims were false and malicious and said she had never kissed or had sex with the complainant and had only been alone with him once.

	Amanda Thompson (pictured), from Rochdale, complained of 'a tingling sensation' in her tongue after eating the strawberry flavoured dessert while on a family holiday on the Greek island of Rhodes
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Share
Travel agent Thomson, with whom the family had booked their holiday, offered its 'deepest sympathies'.
However, her husband Ian and Mrs Thompson's two sons are planning on taking legal action against the holiday company for their role in their mum's passing.
Upon arriving at the Aegean Atlantica hotel in Rhodes in July 2012, Mrs Thompson made the hotel's management aware of her concerns.
The Thompson family - mum Amanda, dad Ian and their two sons - were staying here, at the four and a half star TripAdvisor rated Aegean Atlantica hotel in Rhodes (pictured) in July 2012
She is said to have made known to the holiday agent - as well as the hotel - that she needed food specially preparing as she had severe allergies particularly to dairy products.
On the second night of her holiday she collapsed and died after having eaten food specifically provided for her.
According to the BBC , her husband provided evidence at the hearing in which he detailed how his wife complained of feeling a 'tingling' feeling after she'd eaten the sorbet.
He said she then voiced concerns that she was experiencing an allergic reaction.
In the wake of the tragedy, a Greek pathologist concluded that Mrs Thompson died of natural causes.
He said it was probably due to heart failure.
But grieving Mr Thompson insisted he always attributed his wife's passing to anaphylactic shock - a belief later confirmed by a British pathologist, the hearing was told.

HOW NUMBER OF ALLERGY SUFFERERS IN UK HAS TREBLED IN 20 YEARS
EpiPen's contain a single dose of epinephrine, which is injected into a sufferers thigh muscle
The number of people in Britain affected by allergies has trebled in the past 20 years to around 21 million, according to Allergy UK.
Allergies can range from hayfever to reactions to food, medication and wasp stings and more than 20,000 people are admitted to hospital each year for allergic reactions.
Nearly all of those living with a severe allergy say their daily life is affected by the condition.
Around 90 per cent of food allergy problems are caused by cows' milk, eggs, wheat, peanuts, nuts, fish and shellfish.
Classic symptoms range from rashes, swelling, eczema, diarrhoea, vomiting, asthma and headaches.
In severe cases, food allergies can cause an anaphylactic reaction - when the body goes into shock. Anaphylaxsis can be fatal if it is not treated.
An allergy is the sign the immune system has overreacted to a normally harmless substance, such as pollen, food and house dust mites. While allergies occur partly because of genetic predisposition, environment is important, too.
Many Britons are unaware of the seriousness of having allergies, with a poll of more than 2,000 adults revealing that over two thirds do not know how to help if they saw someone suffering a reaction.
While there is currently no cure for many allergies, sufferers can carry a pre-loaded adrenaline injection, known as an EpiPen. And antihistamines can be used for more minor reactions.
EpiPen's contain a single dose of epinephrine, which is injected into a sufferers thigh muscle.
An allergy to peanuts is the most severe of all the food allergies, with the symptoms of a reaction triggered by a tiny trace of peanut protein.
The inquest revealedthat neither the hotel's own management or Thomson had launched investigations into Mrs Thompson's death.
Mr Nelson said he found that 'astonishing'.
Louise Wilcox, partner at solicitors AST Hampsons, who were representing Mrs Thompson's family, said: 'The conclusions of the coroner have been welcomed by Mr Thompson and his family.
Mr Thompson has always believed that his wife's death was as a direct result of food eaten at the hotel, but not until the conclusion of the inquest was this acknowledged
Louise Wilcox, the Thompson family's legal representative
'Mr Thompson has always believed that his wife's death was as a direct result of food eaten at the hotel, but not until the conclusion of the inquest was this acknowledged.
'Whilst the family remain devastated for the loss there is some relief that they finally have the answers as to what actually happened to Amanda.
'We will now be taking legal action in the civil courts as the family believe that Amanda's death should have been avoidable.
'The family are extremely grateful to the coroner for the thorough nature of the Inquiry.'
Package holiday specialists Thomson released a statement, saying: 'We note the verdict of the inquest today and we'd like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family at this extremely difficult time.'

	Sarah Jay, 41, claimed she resigned from her dream job at Essex Police in 2014 because the force allegedly 'bullied' her, left her depressed and made it difficult to be a single mother.

Following a change in management in January 2014 Mrs Jay experienced increasing problems with flexible working hours which she needed to manage Hollie's childcare - typically arranging au pairs and nursing her through sickness.
She told the tribunal that when new boss Detective Inspector Jim White took over he refused to allow flexibility and Mrs Jay claimed she was not offered any advice or alternative options.
She claimed she was refused flexible working hours to look after her daughter and said 'negative attitudes' towards flexible hours for mothers were rife throughout Essex Police (Headquarters in Chelmsford, pictured)
She said: 'There are still negative attitudes towards flexible working and I believe that is the case and certainly in Essex Police.
'I have encountered a number of problems with flexible working and the force over the years, although I have eventually been able to sort these out by agreeing hours with my then line managers that suited my circumstances.'
Mrs Jay leaving the tribunal court at an earlier hearing with her husband (right)
Speaking of another Inspector, Mrs Jay said his comments were 'representative of the negative attitudes towards flexible working hours within the Force.'
Mrs Jay said she was forced to resign in June 2014 because she couldn't change her shifts.
She added that she had struggled with suicidal thoughts since her resignation, a 'confident sergeant' was replaced 'by an anxious, unconfident mother who struggled with basic day to day activities'.
She was left feeling a 'failure' that she had lost her job and that she could no longer pay her mortgage or support her daughter.
Sgt Jay told the tribunal: 'I honestly believed for a while that everyone and especially me would be better off if I wasn't around.
'For at least a week I seriously considered suicide, looking up preferred options on the internet.
'Even though I have been feeling stronger and better since this Christmas, I am still not the same person I was before DI White took over and put me through what he did, forcing me to leave my career.'
An Essex Police spokeswoman said today: 'Following discussions between Essex Police and the claimant, this case has now been closed. Essex Police is unable to comment further.'
In a separate employment tribunal last year PC Carol Howard, a poster girl for the 2012 Olympics, won a race and sexual discrimination case against the Met Police in July last year.
She was awarded 37,000 after the firearms officer's treatment was branded 'malicious' and 'vindictive'.
Mrs Jay, who currently works as a personal trainer, has decided to settle her claim part way through her tribunal at the East London Employment Tribunal centre (Essex Police HQ, pictured)

	The Prime Minister said he supported the Culture and Sports Secretary John Whittingdale after he told MPs the 79-year-old Swiss chief needed to resign as head of the 'corrupt organisation'.

Asked if the Prime Minister believed the next World Cup should be staged in England, the spokesman said: 'I understand many England fans were disappointed that England's bid hadn't been successful.
'You know that the Prime Minister was one of them. He was out there trying to get a successful England bid at that time. But, the focus now is both the investigations and reform of Fifa.'
It came after Mr Whittingdale welcomed the investigations into the allegations of bribery and corruption in the Commons this morning.
He said: 'It is important that other sponsors reflect on their links to Fifa and consider following Visa's lead.'
Mr Whittingdale said the Government fully supported the English Football Association's position that significant and wide-ranging reforms are urgently needed at the top of Fifa, including 'a change in its leadership'
The Prime Minister's official spokesman this morning confirmed Mr Cameron was 'squarely behind' the FA's bid to get rid of Mr Blatter
Sports Minister Tracey Crouch will write to her European counterparts setting out the UK's concerns and seeking their support for change, Mr Whittingdale said.
Replying to an urgent question, he said: 'The arrests that took place in Zurich yesterday, along with the statements released by the US department of justice and the Swiss attorney general, were shocking in both their scale and scope - however, they were also far from surprising.
'Anyone who has spent any time looking at Fifa ... will know that this is merely the latest sorry episode, which suggests that Fifa is a deeply flawed and corrupt organisation.
'These revelations have shown how important it is for sports bodies to uphold the highest standards of governance, transparency and accountability.
'That is what we ask and expect of all our own domestic sports bodies in the UK, international bodies should be no different and that is particularly true for an organisation like Fifa - an organisation that should be the guardian of the world's most popular sport, not one whose members seek to profit personally from the passion of the game's fans.'
Mr Cameron said he supported Mr Blatter's rival for football's too job Prince Ali bin al-Hussein (pictured)
He went on: 'Football is the world's game and it is our national game.
'It is a fundamental part of British life and culture yet these revelations have dragged the game's reputation into the mud.
'The time has clearly come for change and we will offer whatever support is necessary to the Football Association to see that change realised.'
Tory Stephen Phillips, who asked the urgent question, called for the Government and FA to take steps to recover the 19 million 'wasted' on England's 2018 World Cup bid, which could have gone to grassroots football.
He also called for Fifa to reopen the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, which are due to be held in Russia and Qatar.
The MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham said: 'You will know from your work on the select committee in the last parliament that the English FA made an unsuccessful bid for the 2018 World Cup which cost something in the region of 19 million.
'That bid of course had the backing of His Royal Highness Prince William and of David Beckham amongst others, but it received only two votes.
'What investigations do you now intend to carry out to examine whether that bid failed due to bribery and corruption on the part of Fifa officials?
'Will you discuss with the English Football Association the steps which can now be taken to recover the 19 million which was wasted and which could have gone on grassroots community football in this country?
'Can you say what steps the Government will now take to recover any money which it wasted on the failed bid?
'And do you think, as many members no doubt do, that the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should now be reopened?'
Mr Whittingdale said he would be speaking to FA chairman Greg Dyke later today and said he was pleased the home nations associations had joined with Uefa in calling for the Fifa presidential election to be postponed.

	Following their capture of Palmyra last Thursday, ISIS militants are understood to have won the support of the local population by promising not to destroy the city's famous monuments.

The act of destroying the statue came just days after ISIS gathered Palmyra's citizens together and publicly promised not to bulldoze the city's ancient buildings, as they previously did in Nimrod.
'As for the historical monuments, we will not touch it with our bulldozers as some tend to believe,' ISIS commander Abu Leith was quoted as saying on a local radio broadcast.
However the promise did come with a get-out clause, as the depraved fighters insisted they would 'pulverise' any statues they discovered in the city that the believed citizens secretly prayed to.

The lion statue in Palmyra dates from the first century AD and stood outside the city's famous Temple of Bel.
The statue was dedicated to the pre-Islamic Arabian goddess Al-Lat, who was one of the three chief goddesses of Mecca along with Manat and al-Uzza.
The Temple of Bel itself was built in 32 AD - six hundred years before the arrival of Islam in Syria - and was dedicated to the Semitic god Bel - who was worshiped by Palmyra citizens along withthe lunar god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.
Since ISIS seized control of Palmyra, the temple and its surrounding area have been appropriated by ISIS militants, who are said to be using it as a military base.
Locals who preserved the site for the last 1,900 years are now said to be banned from entering the area unless the are willing to sign up to become ISIS jihadis.

ISIS is accused of executing hundreds of people in and around Palmyra since it swept into the oasis city last week after a lightning advance across the desert from its stronghold in the Euphrates Valley to the east.
But they have also released propaganda images showing the terrorists releasing prisoners from Tadmor Prison - with the convicts seen embracing one another in the streets after being freed.
Yesterday the extremists 'called people to watch' as they executed 20 local men in a Roman ampitheatre in the ancient Syrian city.
The men were shot dead in the restored ruin, which had been used for an annual festival in the city, in front of the crowd. The murdered locals were accused of being government supporters, according to a report from theSyrian Observatory for Human Rights.
'IS executed 20 men by firing on them in front of a crowd gathered in Palmyra's Roman theatre, after accusing them of fighting for the Syrian regime,' Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP.
He added: 'IS gathered a lot of people there on purpose, to show their force on the ground.'

Road to Palmyra deserted but inside the city people celebrate
This morning the European Union added a high-ranking Syrian military official to its sanctions list, as it extended measures against supporters of President Bashar al-Assad for another year.
The EU began imposing asset freezes and travel bans on Assad and his supporters in 2011 to protest a government crackdown on Assad's opponents. With Syria's civil war now in its fifth year, the sanctions list has grown to more than 200 people and 70 organisations.
EU governments decided to extend the sanctions another year and add one person to the list - a high-ranking military official the EU accused of being 'responsible for repression and violence against the civilian population in Damascus and Damascus countryside.'
The name of the official, who will be subject to an asset freeze and ban on travelling to the EU, will not be made public until details of the sanctions are published in the EU's Official Journal on Friday.
Other EU sanctions on Syria include restrictions on exporting equipment that might be used for internal repression and a ban on importing oil from Syria.
ISIS MILITANTS RELEASE CHILLING PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE HORRIFIC CONDITIONS INSIDE PALMYRA PRISON WHERE ASSAD'S SOLDIERS ONCE TORTURED THOUSANDS
Militants fighting for the Islamic State have released images of the horrific conditions in which those opposed to the Assad regime were kept at the notorious Tadmor Prison in Syria.
Following their capture of Palmyra last Thursday, ISIS jihadis released dozens of prisoners from the ancient city's jail, which is famous for the torture and summary execution of those held there.
Images of the now empty prison show tiny windowless jail cells where those accused of committing crimes were held in total darkness once the huge steel doors slammed shut.
Terrible conditions: Images of the now empty prison show tiny windowless jail cells where those accused of committing crimes were held in total darkness once the huge steel doors slammed shut
Horror: The new photographs reveal how conditions at the prison have hardly changed in decades - with prisoners held in disturbingly small cells with cold stone walls with no lighting or bedding
The only semblance of a toilet in the cells is a small hole in the floor, and even the corridors and communal areas are seen covered in mould - suggesting the building is riddled with damp and unlikely to have any sort of heating during Syria's long and bitterly cold winters.
Although the images of the now-deserted jail were released as part of a propaganda exercise by ISIS terrorists, they show a building notorious for the guards' brutal treatment of prisoners and even a state-sponsored massacre of those held there in the early 1980s.
Governor's office:Tadmor Prison was the scene of a horrific massacre on June 27, 1980 following an Islamist Muslim Brotherhood assassination attempt on the then president, Hafez al-Assad
Jail break: This picture shared on several pro-ISIS Twitter account claims to show prisoners celebrating with their liberators after being freed from the notorious Tadmur prison by ISIS fighters in Palmyra
Chilling footage shows conditions inside Palmyra prison
The new photographs reveal how conditions at the prison have hardly changed in decades - with prisoners held in disturbingly small cells with cold stone walls with no lighting or bedding.
The corridors of the prison are crumbling and the entire building looks as thought it was abandoned decades years ago.It is hard to believe the prison was crammed full of prisoners just last week.
Tadmor Prison was the scene of a horrific massacre on June 27, 1980 following an Islamist Muslim Brotherhood assassination attempt on the then president, Hafez al-Assad.
The day after the attempted attack, the president's brother Rifaat al-Assad ordered the country's Defence Brigades to enter the jail and butcher the prisoners. It is estimated that more than one thousand people were killed in the cells, dormitories and corridors of the prison.

No amount of security measures was able to keep an uninvited visitor out of Downing Street this afternoon - after a heron flew into Number 10.
The bird perched itself on top of the Prime Minister's front door, after seeking refuge in the hallway from the unwanted attentions of a crow.
It was photographed by an astonished Conservative aide who admitted he was glad that it had flown away - because it is a bad omen in Greek mythology.

No amount of security measures was able to keep an uninvited visitor out of Downing Street this afternoon - after a heron ruffled flew into Number 10
The heron perched itself on top of the Prime Minister's famous front door, after seeking refuge in the hallway from the unwanted attentions of a crow
The bird was frightened by a nearby crow into taking shelter in the Prime Ministers official residence.
Number 10 staff rushed to close their doors to stop the bird getting deeper into building.
The heron was only there for a few minutes before hopping out of the door and flying off again.
It was only able to enter after the door to Number 10 was left open, as it occasionally is on hot days.
But despite herons being nicknamed the 'shitepoke' in some quarters for their usual reaction to being disturbed, the carefully-maintained shiny black paintwork was not sullied.
'It did not lose its deposit,' joked long-serving Scottish affairs special adviser Ramsay Jones, whose snap of the incident quickly became a hot talking point on social media.
'I was just coming in and the bird was already inside the building, just sitting quietly in the corner,' he said. 'It then decided to fly up on top of the door before it hopped off.'

	Lindsay Lohan (pictured) failed to show up at Westminster Magistrates Court to give evidence against Daniel Vorderwulbecke. He was said to have sent her more than 1,000 messages.

Vorderwulbecke was accused of bombarding  Lohan with more than 1,000 messages and attacking a bouncer who barred him from seeing her rehearse for David Mamet's satire Speed-The-Plow.
A charge of assault against Vorderwulbecke, who allegedly punched a doorman who prevented him reaching the actressat London's Playhouse Theatre, was dropped.
But he still faces two charges of criminal damage and one of harassment and that trial is still going ahead.
Stalking charges against 37-year-old alleged stalker Daniel Vorderwulbecke were dropped, picturedat Westminster Magistrates Court
It was claimed that the 37-year-old, who goes by names including King Lionheart and DJ Dan Cortez, allegedly sent Miss Lohan thousands of text messages.
Mr Bowyer told the court: 'We became aware 10 days ago that Lindsay Lohan was required to return to the US to complete a community service order.
'We were informed by the US authorities she was due to complete the order yesterday and was at liberty to leave the US at 9pm our time yesterday.
'Bearing in mind we had two days set aside for trial, we very much hoped she would take a flight today in order to give evidence tomorrow.
'She has chosen not to do so and she will not be in the jurisdiction to give evidence tomorrow. Having given the matter anxious consideration and consideration within the highest level of the CPS the two charges (of stalking) will not be proceeding.
'The other three charges we will be proceeding with.'
But a spokeswoman for Lohan claimed that the actress was not able to fly back for the hearing today because an official decision regarding her reckless driving case was made in an LA court on the same day.
She reportedly worked eight hours a day for more than two weeks in order to fulfill the requirements ahead of her Thursday deadline.
The defendant  allegedly believes he is married to Miss Lohan and claims to speak to the actress every day personally and through social media.
Vorderwulbecke was arrested near the Playhouse Theatre in August last year after Chiltern Firehouse staff member Lauren Pearce complained he had been bombarding them with abusive emails.
The defendant was interviewed by police and bailed on the conditions that he would not contact Miss Lohan or Ms Pearce, not enter the City of Westminster and surrender his passport.
But he breached his bail conditions the next day by asking staff at the theatre to pass a note to the actress.
Police were called to the Playhouse Theatre again on September 8 where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at 100.
He also allegedly damaged the back door of the Chiltern Firehouse when he failed to see her.
Three days later he allegedly assaulted security worker Cameron Ashrat.
A former DJ, Vorderwulbecke, who also calls himself Dan Cortez, lists himself on Facebook as being married to Lindsay Lohan.
The Freaky Friday actress was doing 125 hours of community service for committing reckless driving in 2012.
Prosecutor Martyn Bowyer today told the court the star had 'chosen' not to attend, meaning the CPS will not be proceeding with the two stalking charges
In order to complete her community service obligations, Lindsay worked at three different charitable organisations including the Duffield Children's Center (pictured)

A newborn wolf's attempts to cuddle, paw and wrestle with its mother have delighted crowds at a zoo in the Czech Republic.
Scenes of the days-old pup rolling around in the dirt as its mother supervises it have proved to be particularly popular among families, who have flocked to see the adorable newborn attraction.
Taken at the Olomouc Zoo in the Czech Republic, the baby Arctic wolf is so young it is yet to develop the distinctive white fur like its mother.
The Arctic wolf's striking colouring means it is hugely popular in zoos and other animal attractions.
They are found in the wild in all areas throughout the far north, but predominately in Alaska, where they have evolved to inhabit some of the most inhospitable conditions on earth.
So strong is the bond between a mother wolf and her cub, in the wild she will often regurgitate her food in order to feed her offspring.
Olomouc Zoo, located in the country's east, is one of the Czech Republic's largest zoos and is also home to many big cats, including lions and tigers.

	Criminals using mopeds are using a loophole in London by removing their helmets if being chased because Met Officers have been ordered to stand down in case the robbers are killed or injured.

Mr Durante, who runs Designer Exchange in Knightsbridge, said: 'I find it incredible that they can literally drive off, take their helmets off and the chase has to stop. I don't really understand it.
'I think we have got to try and stop criminals and stop giving them any chance of taking what is not theirs.'
Another store owner who has suffered from two-wheeled robbers claimed police had 'gone soft' on crime.
The man, who did not wish to be named, said : 'Police should be leaving no stone unturned in catching criminals - including giving chase after a robbery.
'This country is becoming far too much of a "Nanny State" in which police have gone soft on the offenders they are meant to be targeting.
'In any case, it is a criminal offence to ride without a crash helmet.'
The rules were changed following the death of Reece Leon Robinson-Webber, left, who died in August 2008
The Yard revealed to the BBC this week that some suspects take off their helmets when riding away from officers in pursuit.
But Detective Superintendent Raffaele D'Orsi strongly defended the police strategy.
He said: 'We have a moral duty and actually a mandate as police officers to protect the public. That includes offenders who are trying to escape from us.
REECE LEON ROBINSON-WEBBER
Police tried to pull over Reece Robinson-Webber after receiving a call in Streatham, South London
The 15-year-old refused to stop and tried to escape on his moped
Officers gave chase and the youngster mounted the kerb, lost control and crashed his bike.
Chasing police tried to offer CPR, but Mr Robinson-Webber was too badly injured
An IPCC investigation cleared officers of any wrongdoing, but found fault with the Met's policy with dealing with motorcycle pursuits
'We have to mitigate the risk so, if an offender is not wearing a helmet, that will be factored in.'
A Freedom of Information request by the BBC revealed there were 1,240 crimes in London involving suspects on mopeds or motorbikes last year.
The strategy was developed following the death of moped rider Reece Leon Robinson-Webber, 15, from Streatham.
He was killed in West Norwood, Lambeth during a police chase in August 2008.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission then produced a report which said it had 'overall concerns about the standard of training made available to officers and staff in relation to motorcycle pursuits'.
Scotland Yard brought in a number of changes following IPCC recommendations.

        <MainBody>The blister on Archie's arm after he suffered immediate nerve damage
'It all happened so quickly and highlighted just how dangerous today's super-heated hair appliances are.'
She put Archie in a cold bath after the shock subsided but took him to hospital to have the burns looked at, where they learnt he had suffered immediate nerve damage.
Mrs Watkins and her husband Shaun, an electrician, were told Archie's injury was just shy of third degree burns - similar to suffered in severe fires and war zones.
Two years on from the incident, she is now urging other parents to beware of using straighteners of curling tongs near their children after learning that her son will be scarred for life.
The young mother is now using a stand to keeps straighteners irons and curling tongs out of the reach of toddlers.
She said: 'I can honestly say that had I had one at the time, Archie's accident would not have happened.'
His mother, Rebecca Watkins, 25, (pictured with her husband Shaun, left) rushed him to hospital where they found he had suffered immediate nerve damage
THE HAIR-RAISING TRUTH ABOUT STRAIGHTENERS: A THIRD OF WOMEN USE THEM AND THE NUMBER OF BURNS HAVE DOUBLED IN RECENT YEARS
It is claimed a third of all women  and even an astonishing one in five men  now own a pair of hair straighteners.
And while trichologists warn about the damage they directly cause to the actual hair follicles, little is known about their direct dangers.
Previously, straighteners had been steel-plated and took 20 minutes to reach an effective temperature, but now coated in ceramic they can take less than one minute to reach more than 200c.
Hair straighteners can get as hot as an iron. So hot, in fact, you could cook your breakfast on them.
The Child Accident Prevention Trust (CAPT) and the Electrical Safety Campaign have teamed up to raise awareness of what they can do.
There are concerns that hair straightener burns have doubled in recent years. Most injuries occur when crawling babies and toddlers grab at them, step on them, sit on them or pull them down.
Hair straighteners can stay hot enough to burn up to 15 minutes after they have been switched off. But most parents dont know just how dangerous they can be.
Over a third leave hair straighteners to cool down on the floor, on furniture or over a door handle.
CAPT offers advice on its website: capt.org.uk

	The show sparked a diplomatic incident in Argentina when its crew drove through the country in a Porsche with the registration number H982 FKL during its  Patagonia special.

Another complainant accused the BBC of a 'cover-up' and said they needed to see evidence of the purchase of the car to prove the 'amazing coincidence'.
But the Trust's complaints and appeals board said there was no evidence 'which demonstrated that the use of the number plate was a deliberate reference to the Falklands War'.
The complaint was originally rejected by the BBC Executive but was sent to the Trust on appeal.
Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack.
Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another.

The Falkland Islands were taken briefly by Argentina during its 1982 invasion which preceded a 74-day war with Britain.
The war claimed the lives of 649 Argentinians and 255 Britons.
Alicia Castro, the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, demanded an apology from BBC head of television Danny Cohen during a meeting in October last year - which the corporation refused to give.
In a letter to Ms Castro, Mr Cohen said the BBC would also go ahead and broadcast the programme - which aired over Christmas.
He said: 'We will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay.'
He added: 'I am very aware that some have questioned whether the number plates were in some way a prank.
'I would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act.'
Cohen said 'the BBC was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit'.
Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman previously denied the number plate was a 'stunt' and presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was 'shocked' when someone pointed out the link between the number plate and the Falklands War days into filming.
Clarkson was dropped from the BBC following a 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon over hot food.
In March, he was  suspended, then dropped, by the BBC following the incident at a hotel in which Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip, requiring him to visit a hospital A&amp;E department.
Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced on March 25 that Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed.

Owen Paterson, 5, was left behind after a school outing to Blair Drummond Safari Park
The furious family of a five-year-old boy have hit out at 'shambolic' teachers after he was accidentally left at a safari park on his own for two hours following a school trip.
Owen Paterson had been on a school outing to Blair Drummond Safari Park along with 300 other pupils from Pitcorthie Primary and Nursery, Fife.
But once the trip was over and the coaches returned to the school on Monday afternoon - the little boy was nowhere to be found.
After the school realised he was not on any of the vehicles, his frantic mother Amanda, 28, and a group of teachers rushed back to the park where Owen had luckily been found by a security guard still playing in the safari park's children's area.
Council chiefs have now launched an investigation into the blunder.
But Owen's grandmother, Sandra McQueen, 51, from Dunfermline, said her family demanded 'answers from the school'.
She said: 'There were about 300 kids from the school on the trip to the safari park and other mums have said it was a bit of a shambles.
'When Amanda went to pick him up from nursery at 3pm and she was told that she had to wait for the rest of the buses to arrive because Owen wasn't back yet.
'Then one of the teachers said to her "we don't know where Owen is". All the buses were in but they didn't have any clue where he was.'
Mrs McQueen said: 'I asked if they had phoned the police and they said 'No', so I told her that I wanted the police involved.
'Four of the teachers got into a car and Amanda got into another one with another teacher and her husband and they drove to the safari park.
'One of Amanda's friends phoned her on the way and said that she had spoken to the park but that no one else at that point had phoned about it.
'The safari park sent out their security to look for him and he was found about 3.30pm by the security guard.
'We're not sure where exactly he was found, but Owen said he was in a play park and the guard had come over to him and asked his name. After that he was taken to their restaurant.
'He'd been missing since the busses left at 1.15pm and no one had any idea where he was.
'Amanda was so relieved. My heart sunk when she first called. He's her five-year-old boy. Anything could've happened to him there, it's full of wild animals.'
Owen was left behind at Blair Drummond safari park by bungling school staff - who only noticed when they arrived back at the nursery an hour later (stock picture)
A group of 300 children - accompanied by 70 adults - enjoyed a day out at Blair Drummond, near Stirling, which houses lion and tiger enclosures among its attractions (stock picture)
Council officials visited the family on Tuesday to apologise, and promised an investigation would be launched.
Mrs McQueen added: 'They said they had contacted the Care Commission and there would be an inquiry in to it, but when we phoned the Care Commission on Wednesday, they said they'd not heard anything about it.
'We're very angry and we want answers about what happened and why the teachers never did a head count or took a register.

Winston Churchill was  the illegitimate son of the King of Serbia, a new book claims.
Author Dragoslava Koprivica claims the  former British Prime Minister's mother had a secret relationship with Milan Obrenovic before he went on to rule the Balkan state.
She also alleges that Churchill tried to cover up  the romance by altering his mother's diaries.
In her book King Milan and Lady Churchill, Koprivica, 44, says she spentyears studying archives across Europe, gathering information on Jeanette Jerome, who became Lady Randolph Churchill when she married Churchill's father Randolph in 1874.

Koprivica claims her sources included the diary of one of the Lady Churchill's sisters which reportedly described her love for Milan Obrenovic.
During her research, Koprivica also found letters from the Obrenovic family that reportedly made it clear they knew about this love.
She says Milan Obrenovic and Lady Churchill met in Paris in 1867 while they were studying and that she left diaries which Churchill allegedly altered to hide the romance.

She said: 'After his mother's death Churchill took her diary and removed from it all the pages where her love relationship with Obrenovic was described.
'There are many gaps in the biographies about Churchill's family about the time when Lady Churchill was married and conceived.
Koprivica alleges that Churchill removed pages from the diary of his motherJeanette Jerome (left), who became Lady Randolph Churchill when she married Churchill's father Randolph (right)
'There is also clear evidence that Churchill was interfering with his and his mother biographies and in the relevant years removed everything that he didn't like.'
According to Koprivica, the memoirs, diaries and letters show that her son was in fact the child of the Serbian king Milan Obrenovic (1854-1901), who was notoriously unfaithful to his wife
Presenting her book in the north Serbian town of Gornji Milanovac, she said: 'I used hundreds of books and details from different archives to complete the book in three years.'
She added that Joseph Stalin probably knew of the relationship.

She said one of the compelling pieces of evidence was at the Yalta Conference in 1945 when Churchill met Stalin and the US president Roosevelt to decide upon the fate of post-war Europe.
Churchill was apparently strongly against the idea of a monarchy prevailing in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia at the Yalta Conference.
Koprivica used some records by Stalin in which he wrote that both him and Roosevelt were surprised by Churchill's support for the Communists of Yugoslavia.
Because of Churchill's policy, Stalin humorously asked (paraphrasing) 'Did one of the Serbian monarchs personally step on your toe?'

said
"mum, you'd never guess what I've just found in a loaf of bread".'I thought she was going to say a mouse or a spider, but I never would'vethought she was going to tell me she'd found metal nails.
'At that age, toddlers eat anything, so even if she wasn't making him asandwich, he may have reached up for a slice of bread unknowingly. It's truly terrifying.'
She added: 'If she hadn't spotted it, he could've bitten into it and cut hismouth open, he could've choked or swallowed it and it's horrible to say, butit could have been fatal.'

She has been asked to send the slice back to the head office so they canestablish where it was manufactured, but she is worried the bread will be lost in the post.
'It's really not good enough,' she added.'We're not trying to get anything out of this.
'We just want an apology and an assurance that no other family will have togo through this.
'It's disgusting that it happened in the first place.
'It's hard to tell whether someone has done this intentionally, but eitherway, it should never have been allowed to happen.
'That nail could've killed my grandson and they didn't even apologise tous.'
The family say they will never touch a loaf of Kingsmill again.

Defence: Jo Crossland, chief operating officer of Donisthorpe Hall in Leeds, insists the application is to allow families to celebrate bar mitzvahs
A Jewish nursing home has applied for a late licence to host 'alcohol-fuelled' bar mitzvahs - a move branded by angry neighbours as dangerous.
Donisthorpe Hall is hoping for a licence from Leeds City Council that would allow alcohol to be supplied on evenings from Saturday to Thursday and music played every night.
However neighbours have described the idea as inappropriate, warning that it would destroy the calm enjoyed by local residents - with another saying: This is a nursing home, not an entertainment venue.
But Jo Crossland, the homes chief operating officer, insists the application is to allow families to celebrate bar mitzvahs, adding that she only wants to reinstate an old similar licence.
Noise nuisance and anti-social behaviour are among the concerns cited in papers to be considered by the councils licensing sub-committee next Tuesday.
One objector wrote: I believe it is inappropriate and potentially dangerous to allow alcohol to be sold in a building dedicated to the care of elderly people.
Another said: This is a nursing home, not an entertainment venue... residents are on high medication so alcohol until 11pm would not be advised.
Ms Crossland said the application merely sought to reinstate a previous licence which had lapsed when her predecessor left last year.
She said: We have a function room and the functions we hold there are family parties, bar mitzvahs, 90th birthdays and that sort of thing.
We have a lot of elderly residents and it means they can have parties on site. We probably hold no more than six to eight functions a year and some of them are little more than tea parties.
Looks after 182 residents: Donisthorpe Hall (above) is a Jewish residential and nursing home with 230 staff
Donisthorpe Hall is a Jewish residential and nursing home with 230 staff, which looks after 182 residents in nursing, residential care and specialist dementia care units.
According to its website the accommodation and facilities can be favourably compared to that of a quality hotel.

It is believed Ms Bali had gone on holiday for around three weeks but it is unclear where she went. The dog was rescued a few days into her trip.
Animal welfare officers found the dog in a filthy garden full of junk, including broken toys, odd shoes, a mop and empty water bowls.
Ms Bali insisted she had asked a friend to go in and feed Coco throughout June 2014, but no evidence could be found to back up her claim.
She admitted one count of animal cruelty when she appeared at Reading Magistrates' Court and was ordered to do 80 hours community service.

She was banned from keeping animals for 10 years and told to pay 600 costs, plus a 60 victim surcharge.
Ian Blake, neighbourhood enforcement manager, said: 'Thankfully Coco was none the worse for wear, thanks to the neighbours who fed and watered her.
'But she was clearly very distressed and it's hard to imagine what she went through in those few days.'
Coco was later rehomed and is living happily with another family.
Councillor Sohail Munawar, from Slough Borough Council, said: 'It's beyond me how anyone could leave their pet at home alone while they go off on holiday.
'I'm pleased with this result and hope it sends a warning to others who think they can get away with mistreating animals.'

A vicious gang of teenagers who Tasered a motorist in a sick attack where he was left with memory loss and speech problems have avoided prison.
Stephen Burns, 18, Connor Clift, 18, and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, attacked Darren Ewers 'like out of control wild dogs', a court heard.
Basildon Crown Court was told the group had got hold of a Taser gun and were using it on each other after drinking cheap vodka during a friend's 18th birthday celebrations.
Stephen Burns, 18, Connor Clift, 18, and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, attacked Darren Ewers 'like out of control wild dogs' in an unprovoked attack in December last year
The party spilled into the street where the gang jumped in front of a taxi and punched the driver as he made attempts to reason with the boys.
The court was told that they then flagged down Darren Ewers who was Tasered by Burns as he tried to get out of his car.
He was dragged from the vehicle before being punched in the head multiple times, electrocuted again and left lying unconscious in the street.

Mr Ewers suffered short term memory loss and speech problems as a result of the unprovoked attack in December last year.
Judge Samantha Leigh told the group: 'You acted worse than savages that night. Like drugged up, spaced out, violent idiots.
'I want to make it clear I am giving you a second chance but if you fail to comply with any conditions I impose you will be back in front of me and I promise I will activate these sentences.'
Judge Samantha Leigh at Basildon Crown Court (pictured) told the group they behaved 'worse than savages that night' but they all escaped with a suspended prison sentence and youth rehabilitation order
Burns, from Rayleigh, Essex, pleaded guilty to assault and possession of a stun gun.
He was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and was ordered to pay his victim 1,000 compensation.
Clift, also from Rayleigh, Essex, pleaded guilty to assault and was handed a 16-month prison sentence suspended for two years and compensation costs of 500.
The 17-year-old pleaded guilty to assault was ordered to complete an 18-month youth rehabilitation order and pay 1,000 in compensation.

Three yobs sprinted round the corner and repeatedly punched him, forcing him to the ground while another  jumped out of the Audi and sprayed a fire extinguisher at him.
The attack, which lasted ten seconds, was witnessed by Mr Sithambaranathan's seven-year-old son who was in the front passenger seat at the time.
Mr Sithambaranathan had parked his BMW on the road and was taking 4,000 of takings to the post office when a red Audi A4 pulled up next to his car
The Audi can be seen on CCTV footage as it pulls up alongside MrSithambaranathan's silver car
Three yobs then sprinted round the corner and repeatedly punched MrSithambaranathan in the head
After snatching the money, the gang then jumped into the Audi and sped off, leaving Mr Sithambaranathan suffering head and neck injuries.
Speaking after the attack, he said: 'I thought they were going to stab or kill me. I remember the white powder everywhere, all over me and I could see nothing.
'They didn't ask for the money. If they ask for the money then you know they've come for the money.
'I was really worried about my son. I didn't know, where is he?! I thought they were going to take the car as well because he is inside it.
'It was a very frightening moment. I believe it's not only me. They are out there. It will happen to somebody else as well.'
Police today released shocking footage of the raid, showing how the hooded thugs wearing ski masks bundled Mr Sithambaranathan to the floor, leaving him fearing for his life
Another gang member jumped out of the Audi and sprayed a fire extinguisher at MrSithambaranathan
The getaway car had false number plates with the registration number A61 HBH.
Detective Constable Isobel Griffiths, of West Midlands Police, said: 'The garage worker was quite violently attacked as he went about his business, leaving him with nasty injuries which needed hospital treatment.
'Unfortunately those involved had their faces covered and the red Audi A4 was on false plates.
'We hope that someone who was in the area that Saturday morning may remember seeing the car, seeing it being dumped somewhere or maybe spotting the occupants changing over number plates later that day.
'We urge anyone who has any information to contact us as soon as possible to help identify those involved.'
Following a BBC Crimewatch appeal on Tuesday night, a spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'We have received a number of calls about the suspect and the vehicle, and we are in the process of following up these positive lines of inquiry.'

A City trader offered a broker a 'humongous deal' as he tried to manipulate a key interest rate which is behind trillions of dollars worth of financial deals, a court has heard.
Tom Hayes, 35, promised to pay his contact up to $100,000  if he kept the Libor rate 'as low as possible', jurors at Southwark Crown Court in London were today told.
Prosecutors in his trial claim that Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, was motivated by 'greed' and acted as the 'ringmaster' in an enormous fraud to rig the benchmark interest rate used for interbank lending.

The court heard that, in a telephone call in 2008, Hayes told a broker: 'I don't care right - just get me any f****** trade which pays you basically, mate.
'If you keep fixes unchanged, I'll do a humongous deal with you.
'If you keep it as low as possible, I can do that.
'I'll, of course, support and pay you...$50,000, $100,000, whatever you want, all right?
'I'm a man of my word.'
Jurors were also told that Hayes exploded with anger when he felt brokers were not doing his bidding.
The court was told that Hayes, in a 2008 phone call, offered a broker $100,000 to keep Libor low
'It is a disgrace I am livid,' he wrote in one message dated May 2009.
'I am missing out on everything today, no one is giving me any priority, I am going to pull the line...that was pathetic.'
One contact assured him: 'I devote 100% of my time and effort into helping you make money.'
In another message read to the court from the same year, Hayes moans some of his contacts are 'too busy planning trips to Marbella' to help him out, it was said.
'This is another occasion where Mr Hayes is clearly unhappy, it is basically I am really cross with what you guys have been doing, you are not getting me into trades,' said Mr Chawla.
Hayes begged brokers to help him spin the Libor rates in his favour and then handed them kickback payments by setting up 'utterly pointless' deals, it was said.
'Wash trades' involved two banks striking a deal, and then putting through the same deal but reversing their positions.
By mirroring each other, there was no risk to the trade so neither bank lost or gained cash.
But the brokers still raked in substantial fees and Hayes used this method to send bribes to keep his contacts sweet, jurors were told.
Mr Chawla said: 'There were 14 wash trades in all while Mr Hayes was at UBS and on which UBS paid brokerage, paid commission - they were nothing more than kickbacks or bribes to rewards his brokers.'
Jurors were shown a spreadsheet showing UBS paid a total of 471,500 in brokerage fees for the pointless deals.
Hayes also targeted a broker, described as an 'enthusiastic assistant', to help him manipulate the daily Libor rates.
'Low everything please mate,' Hayes wrote to the broker on February 25, 2009, on the Bloomberg chat system.
WHAT IS THE LIBOR AND WHY DOES IT MATTER IF IT'S MANIPULATED?
The Libor rate, or London Interbank Offered Rate, is an interest rate at which banks lend money to each other around the world.
Rate rigging is when traders or brokers collude to set artificial rates, rather than genuine assessments of what the borrowing rates should be.
Bankers are able to take out bets, or contracts, based on the way the rates will move.
If they find a way to manipulate the rates, or persuade someone to manipulate them for them, then they are fixing the bet in their favour. This seriously undermines the integrity of the Libor financial system, on which global banks and financial institutions rely.
British trader Tom Hayes is charged with eight counts of conspiring to defraud by 'dishonestly' manipulating the Libor interest rate.
The Libor rate is linked to the cost of trillions of pounds worth of investments and trades. It is set in many different currencies  Hayes is accused of fiddling the rate for Japanese yen.
The charges carry a maximum jail term of ten years.
'Got ya,' replied the broker.
'If you get 3m [three month Libor rate] down you will get a decent deal from me tomorrow,' urged Hayes.
In a further message Hayes tried to persuade his contact to push for the rates he wants.
'Alright well buy them lunch, do whatever you can do,' he wrote.
'Yeah, yeah...just making sure they told the stupid f*****g c***s, they sound like a right load of idiots these cash dealers,' replied his pal.
In a message to another contact, Hayes wrote: 'I'm just trying to think who you might be able to f*****g lean on a bit today.'
Mr Chawla said: 'Does that have the hallmark of honesty to it?'
He added: 'That is the conspiracy at work...getting them to speak to their clients, their mates at the bank to move to mates rates in order to help Mr Hayes.
'In order to help his trading position and in return for that they put through these wash trades or bribes.
'Just putting it all together that is what it's about.'
Hayes bragged to another broker he had made millions of dollars for UBS, the court heard.
'Touch wood had a good start, up 105m this year so far,' he boasted in April 2009.
His contact replied: 'Good to hear. Christ. Last time we spoke you mentioned 60 million and I thought that was ridiculous.'
Hayes even told him what his future position would be months down the line, despite Libor being set on a daily basis.
Mukul Chawla QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Hayes was becoming an 'increasingly dominant force' within his market by May 2008, and he was approached by another bank, Goldman Sachs.
'He was offered quite a lot of money but UBS wanted to hold on to him,' the prosecutor told the court.
The jury was shown an email dated June 24, 2008, from UBS's head of European trades, Sascha Prinz, to the investment bank's chief executive, Jerker Johansson, which described Hayes as one of his 'most talented traders in Tokyo'.
'Tom Hayes is being aggressively pursued by Goldman Sachs,' he wrote.
'They have offered Tom a larger role with significantly more responsibility, plus a $3.2million guarantee for 2009.'
Hayes' bonus at UBS for 2007 was $1.25million, which was 'on the low side of his expectations', Mr Prinz added.
Hayes wasarrested in December 2012 as part of a massive criminal inquiry into the scandal by the Serious Fraud Office. His trial at Southwark Crown Court is expected to last almost three months
He went on: 'I don't believe in guarantees in managing my business...but I would like to make an exception in this case and offer Tom a target letter with a target of $2.5million for 2008.
'I believe that, in conjuction with some changes in responsibilities, it would convince him to stay at UBS.
'Throughout this whole process he has behaved utterly professionally.'
Hayes was sent a letter from UBS the next day which offered him target-related pay for 2008 of 269 million yen, or 1.29 million, the court heard.
Mr Chawla told the jury: 'Because of the financial crisis, Mr Hayes didn't receive anything like that but that was what he was promised, just under 1.3 million for that year.'
The jury has previously been told that Hayes left UBS in September 2008, and joined American bank Citigroup, where he earned around 3.5 million for just nine months' work in 2009.
Hayes, of Fleet, Hampshire, denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud over a period from 2006 to 2010.

	Alina Rudya was just one when her parents fled her hometown of Pripyat in Ukraine in the wake of the meltdown at the power plant, where her father worked, in 1986.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>Alex Salmond appeared to be very vocal as the Queen exits
Alina takes a self-portrait in her old apartment in the Ukrainian town of Pripyat which she escaped as a baby after the disaster. She decided to pose nude to show 'where my life basically started over because of the disaster, so I am both vulnerable and exposed at the same time'
Poignant reminder: When
Rudya
visited her old apartment, she found this photograph of her and her mother on the floor after all these years
Reflection: Alina gazes out of the window of her family's apartment over the wasteland left behind when the town was abandoned 30 years ago
She added: 'This is our apartment, number 24, at Lenin Street. Many people ask me why I am nude, and my answer is that I wanted to show the place I came from, where my life basically started over because of the disaster, so I am both vulnerable and exposed at the same time.'
Her father, Constantine, was working as an engineer at the plant on the night of the accident.
She said: 'He was there when the whole thing happened and he couldn't leave his shift, even though just next door the tragedy was happening.
'His friends were working on the fourth reactor, which exploded and some of them died back in 1986, some others are still alive and I hope to photograph them for the project.'
The second part of her project will once again see her return through the forbidden zone to Pripyat to share stories of other people whose lives were changed by the disaster.
Turning back the clock: The 30-year-old, who now lives in Berlin, first returned to the town in 2012 and is now looking to make another visit to complete her project to mark the 30th anniversary of the Chernobyl catastrophe
Eerie: Alina took this ghostly image of herself in an area outside her family's old home.The first part of the project, called

	Scots Nats MPs had to make to do with a white rose from Ethiopia, instead of the native Scottish flower they were meant to be paying tribute to when they took their seats in Westminster yesterday.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>comments
Scotland's new army of nationalist MPs made a dramatic show of their patriotism  yesterday - by adorning themselves with a special floral buttonhole for the state opening of Parliament.
But the stunt - in honour of the patriotic poem 'Little White Rose of Scotland' - backfired today after it emerged the flower chosen was actually an ordinary rose grown in Africa and exported around the world.
The SNP this morning attempted to brush off the embarrassing revelation - insisting they 'did not care' where the flowers came from.

'THE WHITE ROSE OF SCOTLAND'
Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid (pictured)
SNP MPs and its members of the Scottish Parliament have made a tradition of wearing the floral button hole at all Westminster and Holyrood parliament openings.
The flower was made famous by Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid in 'The Little White Rose of Scotland'.
The poem reads:
'The rose of all the world is not for me
'I want for my part
'Only the little white rose of Scotland
'That smells sharp and sweet - and breaks the heart.'
But the claim appears to undermine the opening line of Hugh MacDiarmid's famous poem, which the flowers were supposed to honour.
The poem starts:The rose of all the world is not for me.'
MacDiarmond says  all he wants is the little white rose of Scotland which smells sharp and sweet and breaks the heart.
All 56 of the Scottish National MPs adorned themselves with the dazzling white rose in tribute to the poem as they arrived in Westminster for the Queen's Speech yesterday morning.
But it emerged this morning that the rose chosen by the SNP - at a florists in Westminster - was not the Scottish variety glorified by MacDiarmid, but an ordinary florists rose grown mainly in East Africa.
The Royal Horticultural Society today confirmed the flower worn by the SNP MPs was not the Scottish rose.
The organisation's chief horticulturalist Guy Barter told MailOnline: 'The Scottish white rose is a very pretty little thing. But they are seldom, if ever, offered by florists.
'The SNP appear to be wearing white florists roses. Florists roses are a commercial form of rose bred to produce long-stemmed neat roses for button holes and arrangements.
He said the florists rose was actually derived from English tea roses about 50 years ago.
But he said: It is now a specialist branch of rose breeding with little in common with garden tea roses.
'Rose cut flower production is dominated by Kenya, Columbia, Israel and Ethiopia, and to the best of my knowledge none are now grown in Britain and few even in Holland which is the centre of breeding cut flower roses.
He added: 'The tea-rose has a long lineage of Asian and European species and as the hybrid tea rose was first breed in France.
'It has been and still is extensively bred in the UK, USA, France and Germany. It is not especially English, and the world register of rose varieties is held by the American Rose Society.'
An SNP source this morning insisted said they had never claimed the flower was an actual Scottish rose.
Its insignificant where the rose comes from. It symbolises the white rose in the poem, the source said.

AN EXPERT VIEW: THE SCOTTISH ROSE IS 'A PRETTY LITTLE THING' BUT  SELDOM IF EVER AVAILABLE TO BUY IN BRITAIN
Guy Barter, of the Royal Horticultural Society, confirmed the flower worn by the SNP MPs was not the Scottish rose:
'The Scottish white rose is a very pretty little thing. They are seldom if ever offered by florists.

	The family of tragic Gemma Wilks' from Lincoln, pictured, looked on in horror during her exhumation when they saw that the 23-year-old's coffin had caved in while ti was being exhumed because of errors in her first post mortem.

An inquest heard the coffin was dug up in September last year at 3am from its site at Newport Cemetery in Lincoln.
During the exhumation, Ms Wilks' family looked on in absolute horror when she saw the coffin had collapsed inwards. The trauma of the revelation made her miss work for the next three months due to stress.
A second post-mortem was then conducted by Home Office pathologist Professor Guy Rutty who found that she died of an overdose of prescribed medication.
An inquest at Lincoln Cathedral Centre heard the exhumation was extremely rare.
The pathologist said that her gall bladder was normal, even though it had been removed eight years earlier
Mrs Wilks, from near Bracebridge, Lincoln, said: 'Ill never forget the exhumation. It was terrible.
'The coroner said it was the only one hed ever ordered in more than 20 years.
'It took nearly four hours and there were people there from all over the world because it was so rare.
'Gemma had a coffin which had collapsed in on her. I had to turn away at that point and I had three months off work because it was so horrible.
'It was an absolutely awful situation because the second funeral was within days of the exhumation, so we had to bury her without her heart.
'Because Dr Imrad Soomros cause of death said heart failure we were issued with an interim death certificate and given the go-ahead for her funeral.
'Its only because I noticed inconsistencies that I questioned the whole process.
'Gemma could be warm and generous, even though she clearly had many issues and would often cut herself quite badly, requiring hospital treatment.'
The inquest heard that Ms Wilks had lived in agony for 11 years after a foot operation as a 12-year-old led to constant pain, depression, self-harm and five suicide attempts.
Ms Wilks' mother Carrie, right, pictured with grand mother Jennifer James, left, noticed the mistake over the gall bladder and alerted authorities who ordered that her daughter's body should be exhumed from her grave
Ms Wilks' family looked on in horror as they saw that the lid of the coffin had caved in
She had been diagnosed with an emotional personality disorder and was taking six different drugs for pain management and depression.
Professor Rutty was brought in by Senior Central Lincolnshire Coroner Stuart Fisher to investigate what the hearing was told were 'inconsistencies' he found in the first autopsy.
He told the hearing: 'Considering the medical history of an individual with a history of self-inflicted injuries, attempted suicides and circumstances suggesting an overdose, it would be most unusual to have issued a natural cause of death.'
Mr Fisher said that the General Medical Council had contacted him to ask for a report on the inquest proceedings because it was investigating Dr Soomros conduct in carrying out the first post-mortem.
Ms Wilks' father  Dean Pearce, 46, said: 'At the end of the day, weve had to bury our only child twice.'
Grandmother Jennifer James said: 'She was a normal little girl until she was 12, then she had the foot operation after the pain from her bones swelling became so intense.
'Her care was as chaotic as her life.
'Gemma could be totally exasperating because of her personality disorder, missing appointments and regularly misusing her medication.
'Her life had been one of a cheerful child who had lots of friends. Eleven years later, we watched her grave being opened.'
The hearing continues.

Although Botox treatment is now becoming more common for some cerebral palsy patients, not all NHS Trusts will fund it and there are often long waiting lists for treatment.
Archie was diagnosed with cerebral palsy in June last year.
The condition, which causes movement and co-ordination problems, is caused by a problem in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles,
This followed a series of complications when he and his brother were born 17 weeks early, and became the most premature twins ever to survive in the UK at that time.
They were delivered at just 23 weeks, on June 13 and 14, 2012, weighing just 1lb 4oz and 1lb 6oz  much less than the UK average of 7lb 8oz.
'When they were born we asked the doctors to just give them a chance and it is just amazing to think that they did that,' Mrs Kennedy said.

Archie and Harley, from Hartlepool, Cleveland, had an unprecedented fight for survival after being born just 23 weeks into their mother's pregnancy.
'Harley was sent to Newcastle hospital while Archie was still at North Tees and that was really difficult for us.'
The boys both had holes in their tiny hearts and at just two weeks old Archie had to undergo open heart surgery, with his brother Harley following two weeks later.
Medics also operated to correct bowel problems, performed laser treatment on their underdeveloped eyes, and put them on ventilators and oxygen to help them to breathe.
But despite the odds, the pair survived and while Harley has eyesight and lung problems, he can walk and talk like any normal toddler.
Both boys were born with holes in their hearts and at just two weeks old, Archie (pictured) underwent open heart surgery
Archie's cerebral palsy means his muscles don't work as well, and he can't talk as well as his brother.
But regular physiotherapy, and Botox injections has seen him stand up alone  and now it is hoped he will be able to walk like his brother.
And despite their troubles the twins have managed to find a touch of notoriety in the local community.
Mrs Kennedy said: 'When we go out shopping all the old ladies stop and say 'oh look it's the little twins from the papers'.
'It is amazing to think that because I don't look at them as the smallest twins.
'They are both incredible and they are both as strong as little oxen.
'It is incredible they have come this far but they have just bounced off each other.

	The hungry lions were caught off guard by the warthogs when they decided to take a break after digging down into the burrow in Greater Kruger, South Africa, for more than four hours.

He said: 'The pride were on a mission to dig a pair of warthogs out of their burrow.
'After four hours of hard work and expending a dangerous amount of energy, these seven lions came off unlucky.'
DARING warthogs outsmart a pride of hungry, predatory lions
Three lions are initially spotted digging down into a burrow by photographerKevin McLaughlin
While two sun themselves, another sticks his head into the hole in the hope he can get the warthogs out
A closer shot shows two lions sticking their heads into the burrow and getting covered with grey dust
After working for such a long period of time in the searing African heat, it is unsurprising one lion risks taking a small break as he looks the other way
He added that the lions belong to the Ross Pride, which was once 22 lions strong. 
'Since returning to the area without their dominant males and with the adult sons having been ousted, the pride numbers only seven now,' he said.
'It's three adult lionesses and four sub-adult cubs.'
In a split second the warthog takes its chance and sprints out of the hole, catching all the big cats by surprise
The warthog gets a good distance in front of the lions before they even have a chance to react
As the lions give chase to the first warthog, a second darts out from behind the dusty heap to safety

	MBE poppy seller like Olive Cooke is also plagued by 'deplorable' charities
      </title>
        <Link>
	http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3100646/MBE-winner-sold-poppies-78-years-plagued-deplorable-charities-like-ones-hounded-tragic-seller-Olive-Cooke.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490

	Dionis MacNair, 85, (pictured) from Burley, Hampshire, started selling poppies door-to-door with her mother Ruth when she was just seven years old.
      </Description>
        <MainBody>The opening of the inquest into her death last week heard she had '
long term
issues with periodic depression', and it has been reported that she had become stressed by the endless cold calls and begging letters she was receiving every month from charities.
Ms MacNair today described the charities as 'deplorable' and slammed their treatment of grandmother-of-four Mrs Cooke, who lived in the Fishponds area of Bristol, as 'appalling'.
Ms MacNair, pictured left aged ten, started selling poppies with her mother when she was just seven, and last week she was honoured by the Royal British Legion for her 78-years of service to the charity (right)
The former secretary also said the worst offenders should be 'named and shamed'.
'I think it is deplorable that they bothered her to such an extent, and so many of them,' said Ms MacNair, who has never married
'It
to be cutting your nose off to spite your face.
'I think [what they did to Mrs Cooke] it was appalling. I think everybody does.
'The charities never leave you alone. I've experienced that - I think everyone has.
'They pass your details on to everyone else. It is deplorable.
It has been reported that Mrs Cooke had become stressed by the endless cold calls and begging letters she was receiving every month from charities
Ms MacNair says she has experience of charities passing 'your details to everyone else', and says she will put the phone down on cold callers
'I just put the phone down and say I don't want to talk, but I am fairly thick-skinned and a lot of people aren't and I'm sure she did find it hard.'
She
added: '
I think [the cold calling] is taking advantage of the vulnerable in the way that should never happen, certainly not from charities and especially not to dedicated people like her.
'I think the worst offenders should be named - I say name them all and say absolutely everybody thinks this is deplorable, you're killing your own charity.
'People aren't going to help you if they continue doing this sort of thing.'
Mrs Cooke's family have insisted that - while the letters and phone calls were intrusive and a nuisance - the charities were not to blame for her death.
Ms MacNair's mother Ruth, pictured on her wedding day to naval officer Ian, started supporting the British Legion after it was launched in 1921
Ms MacNair started going out with her mother to raise money as she grew up in Alverstoke, Hampshire
Ms MacNair's mother Ruth, an artist and wife of a naval officer, started supporting the British Legion after it was launched in 1921.
She started going out with her mother to raise money as she grew up in Alverstoke, Hampshire.
She
recalled: '
We had only just moved in and my mother took me around poppy selling.
'It was a very good way of meeting the neighbours and as a result we had a wonderful free childhood without realising that people were keeping an eye on us.
Ms MacNair's father Ian (pictured) served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War
'I used to rattle the tin and she used to carry the tray.
'I did it for years and years and then eventually took over from her.'
The family moved again to Malta and Gibraltar, where Dionis' father Ian served in the Royal Navy during the war before they returned to Burley.
Ms MacNair was presented with an award and certificate by Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire Brigadier David Harrison recognising her work for the Legion.
She was the first woman to be elected as a New Forest Verderer - overseeing the management of the area - and was awarded an MBE in 2010 for her services to the region.
Mrs Cooke started selling poppies in 1938 when she was just 16 after her father served in Gallipoli during the First World War.
She devoted herself fully to the charity after husband Leslie Hussey-Yeo, a sailor in the Royal Navy, was killed in Italy in 1943, leaving her a war widow at the age of 21.
The great-grandmother dedicated almost eight decades to raising thousands of pounds, selling an estimated 30,000
poppies
in 76 years, andwas a familiar face in Bristol and stood in the doorway of the city's cathedral every year in the lead-up to Remembrance Day.
It is claimed the former postwoman 'lost faith in people' two months before her death when 250 in cash she sent to a relative went missing in the post.
She was also dealing with constant phone calls and up to 260 begging letters a month from charities pestering her for cash.
Mrs Cooke was found dead on a cliff face overlooking Clifton Suspension Bridge after she was spotted jumping from a ledge on May 6,two days before the anniversary of VE Day.
Ms MacNair said: 'I think so many of the big charities spend an awful lot on raising money, rather than on actually giving it to the charity.
'When I was a secretary of a charity many years ago we got a thing from the Charity Commission saying they would look very unfavourably on charities who spend more than six per cent on administration. Some of these charity are spending 60 per cent.
'That's not what people give there money for.
'They want their money to go to the cause.'

Witnesses said the car was performing a three-point turn when it jumped forward instead of reversing.
The Peugeot 306 car had green 'passed' plates used by new drivers to tell other vehicles to provided them with extra time and space to allow for any mistakes.
Student George Williams, 22, who lives opposite said: 'The car was turning in the street. I think the driver was expecting to go backwards but she must have got the wrong gear and sped forwards.
'It knocked down a metal fence so it picked up a decent amount of speed.'
The fire service pulled the car out of the house and paramedics checked over the car's passengers
With her 'passed' plates still clearly visible, the woman's Peugeot 306 lies wedged against the Swansea house it was crashed into
The 42-year-old woman driver and her three passengers aged 38, 37 and 33, were left shaken but unharmed by the crash.
The fire service pulled the car out of the house and paramedics checked over the car passengers for any injuries.
A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to the scene following reports of a car which had collided with a house.
'The female driver was checked over by paramedics at the scene. Three passengers in the Peugeot were also unharmed. The vehicle was recovered from the scene.'

A lion has been caught on camera using a hippo carcass as a makeshift life raft - after nearly drowning in an attempt to cross a swollen river to eat it.
Remarkable footage of the big cat struggling to stay afloat and seeking refuge on the bloated carcass was captured by two tourists visiting the Sabi River in Kruger National Park, South Africa.
Filmed by French tourists Denis and Valerie Wiest late last year, the lion was caught in a spot of bother after spying what it thought was a free lunch in the river.
The lion was seen chewing on the hippo carcass in the middle of the surging river in South Africa
But the slippery hippo remains saw the lion tumble into the swollen river head first
The currently quickly started pulling it downstream and it began frantically paddling towards its only refuge
The lion managed to reach the carcass once again and it climbed back on top of it to avoid the rushing water
Mr Wiest confirmed that after misjudging the strong current, the big cat ended up using his meal as refuge.
He said: 'We were filming from the Lower Sabie camp bridge, just above where the dead hippo was lying.

West Midlands Police are now investigating the theft, which took place on March 28.
A post made on Facebook by the force said: 'This is a very upsetting case as one persons thoughtless crime has left the victim housebound and deeply distressed.
'The owner relied heavily on his mobility scooter to get about after a failed operation last year and this is a new, devastating blow for him.
Seen wearing a green jacket and light trousers, the unidentified man is recorded on CCTV entering the house
The burglar keeps his identity concealed by wearing the fur-lined hood of his parka jacket up over his head as he makes a getaway on the 8mph scooter
Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward to help them trace the identity of the burglar
'To know someone has been in his home is bad enough, but for the intruder to be so heartless as to steal his only means of getting about is just unthinkable.
'Wed urge anyone who knows anything about the crime, or the stolen scooter, to contact us as soon as possible.'
Anyone with any information relating to the theft is urged to call DC Cheryl Jones from the Sandwell Police investigation team by dialling 101 or calling Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

Speaking afterwards, Mr Carswell said: 'I had just been in the tube station, and I was heading over to the bus stop. Out of nowhere a mob, over 100 strong, and it got incredibly nasty.
'I mean this was a lynch mob on the streets of London. It was an incredibly violent nasty mob and I was shocked.'
He added: 'It wasn't just the words that were aggressive, they had pretty murderous intent. It was extraordinary.'

Mr Carswell later tweeted: 'Am fine. Bit shaken. As an MP I will always use public transport and I do not want to live in a society when politicos don't'

It came as police chased protesters through the streets around Parliament and Whitehall. Meanwhile, one group staged a sit-in protest near Trafalgar Square, bringing traffic to a standstill.
Police confirmed that at least three people were arrested during the unrest in Westminster today.
One protester, who did not want to be named, described how Douglas Carswell, Ukip's only MP, was surrounded by demonstrators and doused in water before being bundled to safety by police.
He said: 'Douglas Carswell was in St James' Tube, someone spotted him and everyone rushed over.
'Everyone was chanting and he was stuck. The police had to push through the crowd and he got a bottle of water thrown over him. Then police put him in a van and he was driven away.'
Andy Dent, 39, who runs a joinery business and lives in Surrey, said: 'The Tories give tax cuts for the rich, they want to bring back fox hunting - they are trying to turn this country back into Victorian England.
'There are people out there who can't stand up for themselves, but that's what Britain is supposed to be about - helping the underdog and doing the right thing.
'We are going to see more protests when we see what the Tories do when they don't have the Lib Dems holding them back.'
'Shaken': Taking to Twitter later, the MP said that he was 'fine' and would 'always use public transport'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'A 45-year-old man, wanted on suspicion of violent disorder in Whitehall on May 9th, was arrested.
'A 17-year-old youth was arrested on suspicion of assault on police during today's demonstration.
'A man was arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and possession of an offensive weapon during today's demonstration.
'All were taken to a central London police station where they remain in custody.'

	Nicola Sturgeon says she will fight to 'lessen' budget cuts in Scotland, despite a report revealing the average Scot already has £1,600 more taxpayers’ cash spent on them than the typical Englishman.

She said: I think if David Cameron is serious about listening to people right across the UK, then he will want to take notice of how people in Scotland voted because it was him during the referendum on independence last year who said that Scotland should vote to stay in the UK and its voice would be listened to as part of the UK.
She added: If the UK Government sticks to its current proposals, we will argue for ways in which the impact on Scotland can be lessened.
A generous funding formula means that Scots have benefited for years from much higher public spending than the English.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon outlines Scottish Business Pledge
The First Minister - pictured with the Scottish championship trophy Tuesday - said she would demand that the impact of the government's austerity drive should be 'lessened' north of the border
The gap, which stood at 1,496 per head in 2010, had widened to 1,597 per head four years later. Spending has fallen in both nations, but has dropped further and faster in England.
'The SNP won the election in Scotland fairly decisively on the basis of a pledge to argue the anti-austerity case, so that is what we will do', Sturgeon said
Conservative MP David Nuttall said Scotlands decision last year to vote to remain part of the UK meant it could have no argument with the Governments legitimacy.
The Bury North MP accused Miss Sturgeon of trying to whip up anti-Scottish sentiment in England by emphasising the gulf in spending.
He added: The SNP need to recognise they lost the referendum and are in opposition. When it came to the decision about whether Scotland should remain in the UK, the majority of people said they wanted to.
Part of that deal is accepting the winner of the General Election forms the Government of the entire UK. The SNP want to stir up anti-Scottish sentiment in England because they think it helps their cause.
However, in a significant shift, Miss Sturgeon said she now backs the Governments Charter for Budget Responsibility, which sets targets for tackling the deficit.
During the election campaign she had said Labours support for it was equivalent to signing up to the Tories plans for 30billion in cuts.
n Powers for Scotland to set its own income tax levels will be fast-tracked today in the Queens Speech.
The move could mean those north of the border pay less in income tax than the English, Welsh or Northern Irish.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the law will be rushed through by next February. The full devolution of all bands and rates would then be in force earlier than the estimate of 2019/20.

In common with other newspapers, an article of 11 February, Youll have to dig up your grandad...hes not a Muslim, reported that Burbage Parish Council was meeting to discuss if Mr Shadrack Smiths body should be moved to an alternative cemetery plot. We are happy to makeclear the councils position that it has never discussed or considered an exhumation and we apologise for any misunderstanding.
