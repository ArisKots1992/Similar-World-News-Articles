Growing support in US Congress for lifting Cuba embargo

US congressional delegation visiting Havana this week
HAVANA, Cuba (ACN) -- There is growing bipartisan support in the US Congress for legislation that will lift restrictions to travel and agricultural trade with Cuba, asserted Tom Udall, the Democratic senator for New Mexico, during a visit to Havana.
On a visit to Cuba with other Democratic lawmakers, Udall said in a press conference on Wednesday that the most difficult task that lies ahead in relations between the two countries is the work in Congress, which is the body that can repeal the embargo legislation.
"In the Senate we're trying to eliminate the blockade with specific legislation, such as the lifting of the travel ban and agricultural trade, among others," he pointed out, adding that he was optimistic of making progress in that direction.
"The big question is how quickly we can do it, he noted.
The majority of members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, support the lifting of restrictions to trips to Cuba.
He stressed that it does not mean this will happen tomorrow, while recalling that next year there will be a presidential campaign in the US, with the implications this brings.
"We are taking steps in this direction to achieve the approval of these initiatives," he specified.
Udall described as a key moment in history the process of reestablishment of bilateral relations and assured that there is support from the US people for the normalization of relations, although a lot remains to be done.
For his part, Senator Al Franken pointed out that great enthusiasm for the improvement of relations and the lifting of the embargo is apparent and confessed that he is among those in favour of eliminating this measure.
"Even in states like Florida there is great pressure for the normalization of relations with the island, although there is a small minority who has objections," he noted.
He reiterated that the majority of US citizens are in favour of reestablishing relations, but said that "in Congress we have much work ahead."
Similarly, he reiterated how beneficial the lifting of the embargo would be for an agricultural state like Minnesota  where he was elected senator  which would allow commercial exchanges.
In turn, Raul Grijalva, representative for Arizona, agreed with Udall in highlighting how impressed they were with their tour of the Zapata Swamp.
"We can work together on the issue of protected areas. Our tour of the Swamp really impressed us," he underlined.
In that sense, Udall identified two key areas where the two countries can cooperate: tourism and environmental conservation and cultural exchanges.
"We participated in the Biennial Exhibition and for the first time five Cuban artists and the same number of US creators have worked together in this meeting. Cultural exchanges are one of the ways friendship and understanding between peoples can deepen," stressed the senator from New Mexico.
For his part, John Larson, representative for Connecticut, recalled the words of President John Kennedy decades ago, when he said: "Although we cannot end our differences right now, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. Because the final analysis is the following: our most basic common link is that we all live in this small planet; we all breathe the same air; we all cherish our children's future; and we are all mortal."
The four agreed that their stay in Cuba was very productive. The delegation has been in Havana for five days and has held several exchanges with officials of the ministries for foreign trade and investment, foreign affairs and agriculture, members of the self-employed sector, of small cooperatives, and with investors from foreign countries on the island.

Feature: Scripps Spelling Bee unites two Caribbean sisters after 15 years

WASHINGTON, USA -- In the annual pilgrimage to the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee to chronicle the historic efforts of four children from the extended Caribbean, namely, US Virgin Islands, Bahamas, Puerto Rico and Jamaica, this year began as usual, calling around to the various schools with the celebratory felicitations to applaud the respective headmasters, headmistresses and principals and their respective champions, as well as extracurricular accolades.
Claudette de la Haye
The phone call to St Croix, USVI took a strange turn of events. When I called and spoke to headmistress Espinoza at the Lew Muckle Elementary School in St Croix, I was informed that the school had conferred its Teacher of the Year Award on a Juliette Heddad-Miller.
My body went numb and I started to cry... In my disbelief I kept asking Mrs Espinoza to repeat the name again, and again.
I finally let out the most hysterical scream and I yelled, My Ju Ju is teacher of the year!
Headmistress Espinoza said, "Do you know the person?"
And in a sea of tears, I said, Yes, she is my sister!"
The headmistress was indeed surprised and politely turned and said, "Mrs Miller, what is the name of your sister?"
My sister replied, Claudette!
The headmistress let out a joyful, "Wow!"
Now, this is not your everyday coincidence of two women of Jamaican heritage growing up in Nottingham, England, who are contributing their God-given talents towards a better America. Not to mention the fact that the Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee has reunited us. As Juliette's big sister, I am overwhelmed with joy and proud of my sister. She is the best and at every stage of adversity she has conquered seemingly insurmountable odds.
Juliette Heddad-Miller
My little sister Juliette and I had come from at risk communities filled with prostitution in an area called Hyson Green and Forest Fields in Nottingham. We attended Manning All Girls Comprehensive School, where our racist headmistress, Margaret Clarke, sought to deny Juliette being head girl but she persevered.
Our teachers, of Jamaican and Caribbean heritage fell in line behind Mrs Clarke and the school went in uproar.
Some teachers, but not all, betrayed the entire Jamaican community and those that did not betray us as children did their best that they could for us in the community and moved on.
However, it is gratifying to see two little girls of the same mother but different fathers (Chinese and African) diverge and emerge decades later as contributing members of American society. Can you imagine me, the school angel, and Juliette, the school bully, one year apart at Stanley Junior Primary School, where a deputy head, Gary Exeter from New Zealand, challenged us as kids? It is to his credit that he turned the light on for Juliette and kept plugging away at her to get a good education.
Today, my sister Juliette has been an at risk intervention teacher in St Croix for the last six years and I am the first Caribbean and Jamaican journalist since Marcus Garvey in Detroit and the Midwest. I benchmark in automotive journalism, photography, Scripps and all things Caribbean American.
I have not seen my sister in 15 years but I think this story has a notable quality to what two people can do on a positive level in America. We bring to the table a sense of "can do attitude and passion" as well as, which is so important to children, a sense of belongingness, purpose and culture.
And if we all had that as kids the world would be a brighter place to live in.
And in a place like America the possibilities are boundless. Our late mother, Violda Dobbs, would be ecstatic to know that her daughters, her pearls", are still striving for excellence in their respective careers.
I love my sister Juliette dearly and wish her every continued success in St Croix, and that it is truly amazing grace that Scripps Spelling Bee has indeed united us once again.

News from the Caribbean:
Former administration alleged to have embezzled $3.5 billion from Panama
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
By Kenneth Rijock
PANAMA CITY, Panama -- The latest calculation quoted in the unfolding corruption investigation in Panama is an educated estimate that the government of former president Ricardo Martinelli embezzled at least $3.5 billion from public funds. This figure exceeds even the guesstimates previously appearing in local media.
Ricardo Martinelli
Martinelli himself came into office on a purported reform platform and many Panamanians felt that, since their new president was himself a wealthy man, the chances of corruption were slim.
However, Martinelli is now believed to have illegally enriched himself by more than a billion dollars during his presidency, now being characterized as a kleptocracy by anti-corruption prosecutors, who have charged many members of his former administration.
How far will the prosecutions go, and will there only be true reform if those in the new reform government that are themselves guilty of past corruption are themselves turned out of office and arrested?
There are those who want the current president charged for his past dark deeds, and those Panamanians also want the entire Supreme Court of Justice removed for fixing cases for bribes.
Kenneth Rijock is a banking lawyer turned-career money launderer (10 years), turned-compliance officer specialising in enhanced due diligence, and a financial crime consultant who publishes a Financial Crime Blog . The Laundry Man, his autobiography, was published in the UK on 5 July 2012.

News from the Caribbean:
Four more offshore banks reach resolutions with US Justice Department
Published onMay 29, 2015
WASHINGTON, USA -- The US Department of Justice announced on Thursday that the following four banks reached a resolution under the departments Swiss Bank Program:
 Socit Gnrale Private Banking (Lugano-Svizzera)
 MediBank AG
 LBBW (Schweiz) AG
 Scobag Privatbank AG
Todays agreements reflect the Tax Divisions continued progress towards reaching appropriate resolutions with the banks that self-reported and voluntarily entered the Swiss Bank Program, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Caroline D. Ciraolo of the Department of Justices Tax Division. The department is currently investigating accountholders, bank employees, and other facilitators and institutions based on information supplied by various sources, including the banks participating in this Program. Our message is clear  there is no safe haven.
The Swiss Bank Program, which was announced on August 29, 2013, provides a path for Swiss banks to resolve potential criminal liabilities in the United States. Swiss banks eligible to enter the program were required to advise the department by December 31, 2013, that they had reason to believe that they had committed tax-related criminal offences in connection with undeclared US-related accounts. Banks already under criminal investigation related to their Swiss-banking activities and all individuals were expressly excluded from the program.
Under the program, banks are required to:
 Make a complete disclosure of their cross-border activities;
 Provide detailed information on an account-by-account basis for accounts in which US taxpayers have a direct or indirect interest;
 Cooperate in treaty requests for account information;
 Provide detailed information as to other banks that transferred funds into secret accounts or that accepted funds when secret accounts were closed;
 Agree to close accounts of accountholders who fail to come into compliance with US reporting obligations; and
 Pay appropriate penalties.
Swiss banks meeting all of the above requirements are eligible for a non-prosecution agreement.
According to the terms of the non-prosecution agreements signed on Thursday, each bank agrees to cooperate in any related criminal or civil proceedings, demonstrate its implementation of controls to stop misconduct involving undeclared US accounts and pay the penalties in return for the departments agreement not to prosecute these banks for tax-related criminal offences.
Socit Gnrale Private Banking (Lugano-Svizzera) SA (SGPB-Lugano) was established in 1974 and is headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland. Through referrals and pre-existing relationships, SGPB-Lugano accepted, opened and maintained accounts for US taxpayers, and knew that it was likely that certain US taxpayers who maintained accounts there were not complying with their US reporting obligations.
Since August 1, 2008, SGPB-Lugano held and managed approximately 109 US-related accounts, with a peak of assets under management of approximately $139.6 million, and offered a variety of services that it knew assisted US clients in the concealment of assets and income from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), including hold mail services and numbered accounts. Some US taxpayers expressly instructed SGPB-Lugano not to disclose their names to the IRS, to sell their US securities and to not invest in US securities, which would have required disclosure and withholding.
In addition, certain relationship managers actively assisted or otherwise facilitated US taxpayers in establishing and maintaining undeclared accounts in a manner designed to conceal the true ownership or beneficial interest in the accounts, including concealing undeclared accounts by opening and maintaining accounts in the name of non-US entities, including sham entities, having an officer of SGPB-Lugano act as an officer of the sham entities, processing cash withdrawals from accounts being closed and then maintaining the funds in a safe deposit box at the bank and making transitory accounts available, thereby allowing multiple accountholders to transfer funds in such a way as to shield the identity and account number of the accountholder.
SGPB-Lugano will pay a penalty of $1.363 million.
Created in 1979 and headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, MediBank AG (MediBank) provided private banking services to US taxpayers and assisted in the evasion of US tax obligations by opening and maintaining undeclared accounts. In furtherance of a scheme to help US taxpayers hide assets from the IRS and evade taxes, MediBank failed to comply with its withholding and reporting obligations, providing hold mail services and offering numbered accounts, thus reducing the ability of US authorities to learn the identity of the taxpayers.
After it became public that the Department of Justice was investigating UBS, MediBank hired a relationship manager from UBS and permitted some of that persons US clients to open accounts at MediBank. Since August 1, 2008, MediBank had 14 US related accounts with assets under management of $8,620,675. MediBank opened, serviced and profited from accounts for US clients with the knowledge that many likely were not complying with their US tax obligations.
MediBank will pay a penalty of $826,000.
LBBW (Schweiz) AG (LBBW-Schweiz) was established in Zurich in 1995. Since August 2008, LBBW-Schweiz held 35 US related accounts with $128,664,130 in assets under management. After it became public that the department was investigating UBS, LBBW-Schweiz opened accounts from former clients at UBS and Credit Suisse.
Despite its knowledge that US taxpayers had a legal duty to report and pay tax on income earned on their accounts, LLB permitted undeclared accounts to be opened and maintained, and offered a variety of services that would and did assist US clients in the concealment of assets and income from the IRS.
These services included following US accountholders instructions not to invest in US securities and not reporting the accounts to the IRS and agreeing to hold statements and other mail, causing documents regarding the accounts to remain outside the United States.
LBBW-Schweiz will pay a penalty of $34,000.
Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Scobag Privatbank AG (Scobag) was founded in 1968 to provide financial and other services to its founders, and obtained its banking licence in 1986. Since August 2008, Scobag had 13 US related accounts, the maximum dollar value of which was $6,945,700. Scobag offered a variety of services that it knew could and did assist US clients in the concealment of assets and income from the IRS, including hold mail services and numbered accounts.
Scobag will pay a penalty of $9,090.
In accordance with the terms of the program, each bank mitigated its penalty by encouraging US accountholders to come into compliance with their US tax and disclosure obligations. While US accountholders at these banks who have not yet declared their accounts to the IRS may still be eligible to participate in the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program, the price of such disclosure has increased.
Most US taxpayers who enter the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program to resolve undeclared offshore accounts will pay a penalty equal to 27.5 percent of the high value of the accounts. On August 4, 2014, the IRS increased the penalty to 50 percent if, at the time the taxpayer initiated their disclosure, either a foreign financial institution at which the taxpayer had an account or a facilitator who helped the taxpayer establish or maintain an offshore arrangement had been publicly identified as being under investigation, the recipient of a John Doe summons or cooperating with a government investigation, including the execution of a deferred prosecution agreement or non-prosecution agreement.
With Thursdays announcement of these non-prosecution agreements, noncompliant US accountholders at these banks must now pay that 50 percent penalty to the IRS if they wish to enter the IRS Offshore Voluntary Disclosure Program.
These four additional bank agreements signal a change in terrain for offshore banking, said Chief Richard Weber for the IRS-Criminal Investigation (CI). No longer is it safe to hide money offshore and expect that it will not be discovered.  IRS CI Special Agents will continue to follow the money to find those who circumvent the offshore disclosure laws and hold them accountable.

News from the Caribbean:
IMF concludes consultation with Haiti
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
WASHINGTON, USA -- On May 18, 2015, the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2015 Article IV consultation with Haiti.
In December 2014, Haiti completed an arrangement under the extended credit facility (ECF), which helped to support economic growth and maintain macroeconomic stability after the 2010 earthquake. A drought that affected agricultural output slowed GDP growth to 2.7 percent in FY2014 (from 4.2 percent in FY2013), but inflation remained in the mid-single digits. The overall fiscal deficit of the central government remained high, in part due to one-off investment related to the Sandy storm. International reserves remained appropriate at about 5 months of imports.
The implementation of structural reforms to support growth underpins the medium-term outlook, which is nonetheless subject to downside risks. GDP growth in FY2015 is expected to be between 23 percent, and to increase to 34 percent in the medium term. Inflation is projected to remain in the mid-single digits, and gross international reserves to be equivalent to between 45 months of imports, thanks to a prudent policy mix. Risks are mainly associated with a rebound in international oil prices, a stop in external financing from Venezuela, and weather events.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake -- noting positive growth, moderate inflation, adequate international reserves, and an improvement in Haitis debt assessment. Nevertheless, growth remains insufficient to reduce poverty significantly, and vulnerabilities remain against the backdrop of a challenging domestic and external environment. Directors agreed that the authorities new program appropriately focuses on entrenching macroeconomic stability, and ambitious structural reforms to enhance competitiveness, spur inclusive growth and strengthen policy buffers. They stressed that strong ownership and well-coordinated donor support will be important for the success of the program.
Directors welcomed the approval of a revised FY2015 budget consistent with reducing the deficit of the non-financial public sector to about 2.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, in line with debt sustainability and program objectives. They supported the front-loaded fiscal consolidation, and noted that the adoption of an automatic fuel price mechanism and measures to improve the performance of the electricity sector will help contain fiscal risks, and create space for increased priority social and investment spending. They stressed the importance of mitigating the impact of the reforms on the poor and vulnerable. Going forward, directors encouraged the authorities to follow through on reforms to improve public financial management, including the implementation of the Treasury Single Account; and to strengthen tax administration and collection; and budgetary transparency.
Directors encouraged the authorities to maintain a tight monetary stance, as needed, until the fiscal deficit is reduced, and to be ready to increase exchange rate flexibility, in order to preserve adequate international reserve buffers and anchor inflationary expectations. A number of directors expressed concern that, if downside risks materialize, meeting the target for net international reserves could be challenging. Directors took note of the contingency measures that may need to be implemented in such case. Directors also encouraged the authorities to strengthen the monetary policy framework, through improvements in reserve management and the functioning of the foreign exchange market.
Directors noted that the banking sector remains well-capitalized and profitable, while calling for continued vigilance against financial sector risks. They also stressed the importance of sustained efforts to further develop financial intermediation and inclusion. In this regard, they welcomed adoption of the new financial inclusion strategy, and encouraged the authorities to enact pending laws on financial cooperatives and microfinance institutions.
Directors supported the programs emphasis on structural reforms designed to lift Haitis growth potential and enhance its competitiveness. Priorities include: improvements to property rights, credit access and labor productivity; streamlining business regulations; and infrastructure development -- most notably by strengthening the governance and performance of the electricity sector.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the quality of the economic data, with technical assistance from the Fund and other donors.

Jamaica hosts regional workshop on salmonella surveillance and risk management
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
Participants at the salmonella regional workshop in Kingston, Jamaica
KINGSTON, Jamaica (IICA) -- Twenty-five participants, including personnel from the Jamaican poultry and egg industries and veterinarians, microbiologists and public health inspectors from across the Caribbean region, participated in a recently held workshop on salmonella surveillance and risk management on poultry and egg production and processing.
The workshop, which was held in Kingston, Jamaica, on May 20 and 21, 2015, was funded under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures Project, being executed by the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA).
Salmonella is a type of bacteria that is frequently found in poultry meat, eggs and unpasteurised milk. It can cause salmonellosis, a type of food poisoning. It is therefore a major food safety concern.
According to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) and the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO/WHO), salmonella is the most prevalent cause of food borne illness in the Caribbean.
To address this issue, the Caribbean Animal Health Network (CaribVET) veterinary public health working group in collaboration with PAHO/WHO organised the regional workshop to develop Caribbean regional guidelines for integrated surveillance and risk management in poultry and eggs.
Participants were drawn from several countries in the region, including Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago.
This salmonella workshop provides an opportunity for us to practice One Health by working together between ministries of health and agriculture and the poultry producers and processors towards a common goal, said Dr Sandra Vokaty, chair of the CaribVET veterinary public health working group and advisor, veterinary public health at the PAHO/WHO.
One Health refers to an interdisciplinary approach to minimizing harms and maximizing benefits from the co-management of human, animal and environmental health. She further stated that the veterinary public health working group deals with food borne and zoonotic diseases, and therefore has adopted a One Health approach to its work.
Zoonotic diseases are diseases that people can get from animals.
In his greetings on behalf of PAHO/WHO, Dr Kam Suan Mung, disease prevention and control advisor for PAHO, Jamaica, reminded participants of the importance of collaboration on food safety.
He said, Food safety requires a multisectoral coalition that includes ministries of health and agriculture, food safety regulators, food producers, processors, distributors, food markets, restaurants and hotels, and consumers.
Highlighting recent collaborative efforts to combat food borne diseases, Shauna Brandon, rural development specialist of IICA, Jamaica, stated, Over the past 12 months the SPS measures project has worked with key collaborators (FAO, PAHO/WHO, OIE, CaribVET and CARPHA) to execute several interventions to build capacity and coordination to strengthen animal health and food safety in the region.
The 10th EDF SPS measures project seeks to assist CARIFORUM states to gain and improve market access by complying sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures of the European Union and to develop and strengthen regionally harmonized SPS measures. The specific objective of the SPS project is to increase production and trade in agriculture and fisheries which meet international standards while protecting plant, animal and human health and the environment.

Barbados tourism sector records double-digit growth
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
BRIDGETOWN, Barbados -- Barbados tourism sector broke a 25-year record during the first quarter of 2015 to reach 171,471 long stay arrivals.
Barbados Tourism Marketing, Inc (BTMI) chairman, Alvin Jemmott, noted that there were record arrivals in each of the first three months of 2015 and extended his congratulations to all industry workers and partners for their steadfast efforts on behalf of the destination.
This was a very strong winter season. The Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO) has predicted a five percent increase in long stay arrivals for the region for the entire year and we believe our performance in this first quarter bodes well for us to comfortably exceed that target, he said.
Jemmott attributed this milestone performance to a number of factors including increased airlift capacity negotiated by the BTMI; healthy economic conditions in key markets, a commitment to developing new source markets, Barbados strong reputation among its global partners and the agencys solid promotional strategies for reaching the travel trade, media and consumers in each market.
CEO William Griffith revealed that a comprehensive review effort has begun to ensure that the BTMIs policies support their new mandate as a private entity.
I am pleased to say that we have begun the process of updating a number of critical polices in the areas of human resources, marketing and finance in keeping with our commitment to increasing employee engagement and productivity; maximizing our return on marketing investment, and achieving greater levels of fiscal prudence, he said.
In line with these changes, a comprehensive marketing plan featuring traditional and digital marketing programmes has also been developed to guide the organization in resource allocation and monitoring of its various marketing programmes.
Griffith broke down the performance by market, which showed that arrivals from the UK, USA, Canada, and Caribbean and Latin American grew by 12.9 percent, 27.7 percent, 28.4 percent and 10.6 percent, respectively. Germany also grew by 23.6 percent. These strong performances, including a 17.7 percent rise in arrivals from Other CARICOM, overshadowed the 2.4 percent decline in the Trinidad and Tobago market and the dip in arrivals from Other Europe by 27.3 percent.
While the cruise sector declined by 6.1 percent to 217,139 passengers, there was a welcomed increase in home porting, which sees ships purchase goods and services from local dairy, retail and other suppliers. There is also a trend being observed with smaller ships being replaced by larger vessels, some with the capacity to carry of over 4,000 passengers.
Griffith added that the islands total airlift capacity for the May 1  October 31, 2015 summer period was set to rise by 3.6 percent, largely driven by additional flights and the use of larger aircraft by the islands airline partners.
The BTMI CEO went on to project a successful summer period for the island, banking on the fact that there is increasing alignment between our internal operations and structure, and our global strategic marketing efforts.

ST JOHNS, Antigua -- The Expedia group, one of the world's largest online travel companies, has reported an already impactful 2015 for hoteliers on the Caribbean island of Antigua .
Expedia reported that travel demand for Antigua grew nearly 20 percent in the first quarter of 2015 when compared to the same time period in 2014. Additionally, 50 percent of total travel demand to date for Antigua is based on package bookings. Package booking are bookings that combine components like flights and hotel. These bookings are extremely valuable for hoteliers as they generally feature twice the length of stay, are booked two times further in advance and have half the cancellation rate of a standalone (i.e. hotel only) booking.
The Expedia groups market management team is attending the 2015 edition of Showcase Antigua Barbuda, the destinations most influential industry event, from June 5-7, 2015. During the conference, the companys market management team will have an opportunity to strategize and discuss trends and new tools available on the companys multiple platforms to provide increased visibility and incremental demand for the destination.
Expedia market managers truly showcase their value in smaller Caribbean destinations such Antigua as they help hotel partners strategize the optimal channels to generate travel demand, said Demetrius Canton, director of lodging partner services for the Caribbean, Expedia group. Our presence at the Showcase Antigua Barbuda this June reinforces our commitment to the local hotel community, and we look forward to sharing our insight while also gathering valuable insight from hoteliers.
Expedia seeks to continue to add more properties to its portfolio in 2015, to support tourism growth in Antigua and the rest of the Caribbean. By working with the Expedia group, hotels throughout the Caribbean gain exposure to the more than 150 websites in more than 70 countries worldwide, in addition to a myriad of mobile sites and apps.

Schengen visa ceremony in Brussels
ST GEORGE, Grenada (GIS) -- Citizens of Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago may now travel visa-free to Schengen area countries, following the signing of a short-stay visa waiver agreement between the EU and seven Caribbean and Pacific states.
The signing ceremony took place on the margins of the Council Meeting between the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of states and the European Union in Brussels on Thursday.
Grenada's foreign minister, Dr Clarice Modeste Curwen, in delivering her remarks at the signing ceremony, hailed the occasion as a "historic one, and a major achievement in the relationship between our islands and the European Union."
According to the minister, "New frontiers have now been opened in a number of areas, including business and tourism, for the peoples of Caribbean, Pacific and the EU states."
"The reciprocity agreement has been a long time coming," said Modeste-Curwen, "and is a monumental step in promoting ease of travel and freedom of movement, and Grenada is quite grateful to be a partner in this agreement."
Citing the beauty and safety of the region, the minister expressed her hope that the people who this agreement serves will do it justice and remain above reproach, so as to maintain the good relationships.
Welcoming the Caribbean and Pacific states to the ceremony was the EU Commissioner responsible for home affairs, migration and citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulous, who stated that the signing ceremony indicates a commitment to good relations and the further strengthening of the bonds among the people of the EU and the ACP group of countries.
The other signatories also expressed their delight over the materialization of the visa waiver agreement, and acknowledged the hard work and long road it took to arrive at this point.
They all echoed the sentiment that the agreement will revolutionize travel across the different regions.
The policy agreement means that citizens of the Caribbean and Pacific states can now enter visa-free into countries of the European Union, for short stay periods of up to 90 days within a 180-day period.
Citizens of the EU also now have the same privilege in the ACP countries identified under the visa waiver agreement.

Commentary: Holy matrimony! Catholic Ireland becomes trailblazer for gay rights
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
By Anthony L Hall
It might seem a surreal joke, but Ireland became the first nation in the world to legalize gay marriage in national referendum last Friday.

Irelands citizens have voted in a landslide to legalize gay marriage, electoral officials announced Saturday -- a stunningly lopsided result that illustrates what Catholic leaders and rights activists alike called a social revolution.
(The Associated Press, May 23, 2015)
Mind you, the pope himself appeared to bless this seminal event almost two years ago.
Pope Francis replied, when asked about the Vaticans alleged gay lobby, that while a lobby might be an issue, he doesnt have any problem with the inclination to homosexuality itself: Who am I to judge them if theyre seeking the Lord in good faith? he said.
(National Catholic Reporter, July 29, 2013)
Such sublime, passive-aggressive expression of his moral authority led CBS News to run a report headlined, Pope Francis after 2 years: A revolution at the Vatican, just two months ago (on March 15). Which is why the stunning outcome of this referendum is wholly consistent with his revolutionary mission.
Anthony L. Hall is a Bahamian who descends from the Turks and Caicos Islands. He is an international lawyer and political consultant - headquartered in Washington DC - who also publishes a current events weblog, The iPINIONS Journal, at http://ipjn.com
Of course it is a curious thing that, despite the popes apparent blessing, leaders of the Irish Catholic Church mounted a crusade against this referendum. Except that these are the very leaders who the pope has publicly criticized for showing more devotion to religious traditions and practices than to the word and spirit of the Almighty God.
More to the point, this liturgical dissonance is thrown into sharp relief when one considers that their traditions and practices include condemning homosexuality while:
a) engaging in homosexual/pedophile acts themselves;
b) providing indulgences for priests who sexually abuse little boys; and/or
c) knowing full well that a gay cabal has always wielded dogmatic power in their Holy Curia -- as even I have duly noted in such commentaries as Pope Confesses: Theres a Gay Cabal in the Vatican, June 13, 2013.
This infernal legacy of sodomitic hypocrisy accounts not only for the hidden exodus of Catholics becoming Protestants, but also for the growing disconnect even between Church leaders and die-hard members, which the outcome of this referendum reflects.
Still, as much as I laud what the Irish have done, I fear they have set an untenable and misguided precedent.
After all, the right to marry is as fundamental as any human right. And, as the late Justice William Brennan (of the US Supreme Court) might have opined, it offends all notions of fundamental fairness, which is essential to the very concept of justice, for members of any group to have the exercise of their fundamental rights subject to a referendum.
For example, it does not offend in this regard to have a referendum on whether Scotland should leave the UK, or whether the UK should leave the EU. For not only is there no fundamental right at stake, but the result would affect everyone in the country  equally.
By instructive contrast, if the right to marry across racial lines had been put to a referendum in the United States during the 1960s, the vote against interracial marriage would have been as decisive as the vote for gay marriage in Ireland was on Friday.
Thanks to the luck of the Irish, the ends justified the means in their case. But its far more preferable to have fundamental rights codified by legislatures and/or affirmed by courts -- as 19 other countries, including South Africa, Uruguay, and The Netherlands, have done with respect to gay marriage.
Incidentally, in the United States, gay marriage is legal in 37 states: 26 by courts, 8 by legislatures, and only 3 by referendum. But, as the fight for abortion rights demonstrated, denying citizens in any state any fundamental right, which citizens in other states enjoy, presents all kinds of constitutional challenges.
It just so happens that the US Supreme Court will hand down a consolidated ruling on several gay-marriage cases (cited as Obergefell v. Hodges) this summer. I predict it will be a unanimous ruling in favor of the fundamental right to marry nationwide, relying heavily on the precedent the Court set in Loving v. Virginia, US Supreme Court, 1967:
Marriage is one of the basic civil rights of man [and woman], fundamental to our very existence and survival To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial [or gender or sexual orientation] classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the States citizens of liberty without due process of law.
For the reasons stated, I urge members of any minority group demanding legal recognition and protection of their fundamental rights to seek recourse in the courts, not at the ballot box.
Accordingly, with this procedural reservation, Irelands referendum on gay marriage is
Affirmed.

Commentary: China: Strike while the iron is hot
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
By Sir Ronald Sanders
Chinas Premier Li Keqiang, accompanied by over 100 senior Chinese business leaders, visited four South American countries for eight days in May. Along the way, he pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to Brazil, Peru, Chile and Colombia. US$53 billion was announced for Brazil alone.
Sir Ronald Sanders is concurrently a Senior Fellow at Massey College, Toronto and the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, London. Reponses to:
www.sirronaldsanders.com
The Chinese pledges were met with scepticism by Western analysts, who fret over the presence of China in Americas backyard. They used a study, conducted by the Brazil-China Business Council, to argue that only around one-third of Chinas promised investments in Brazil from 2007-2012 were actually done.
While there is no reason to doubt the findings of the study, there is equally no reason to believe that the failure to make the investments rested with China alone; Brazil could have also have contributed by its inability to absorb the investments. In several Caribbean countries, for instance, Chinese offers to undertake projects have either been ignored or the countries have lacked the capacity to implement them.
In any event, even if half of the monies promised by China flows into the four South American nations, they will benefit enormously from the build-out of much needed infrastructure to boost their economies. The Chinese money  Western skepticism notwithstanding  is important.
Caribbean economies can also do with more investment from China in a range of sectors if they are to overcome the lingering effects of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the recession that followed. But to do so, the China-Caribbean relationship needs to be improved and put on a more predictable and certain footing.
What is sure about the Caribbeans relationship with China is that the latter now enjoys a huge trade surplus. In 2013, Chinas exports to the Caribbean totalled US$4.21 billion, more than double its imports from the region valued at US$1.88 billion that year. The sum of US$3 billion, pledged for loans in 2013 by Chinas President Xi to ten Caribbean countries, was less than Chinas trade surplus with the region for the year 2012 alone.
In other words, China recycled its trade surplus with the region for one year to finance its loans to regional countries from which it earns interest and gains political credit.
The huge trade imbalance is a crucial area that needs urgent attention. Even though the Caribbean accounts for less than one percent of Chinas trade with the world, its trade deficit with China is significant to the Caribbean. The Chinese authorities appear to have recognised this issue. Thats why President Xi offered the 2012 trade surplus as loans to the region. It was a classic case of aid for trade.
But, the relationship between China and Caribbean countries ought not to operate on an ad-hoc basis, nor should it be reliant only on what China is willing to offer.
The region does have some bargaining capacity, and it should use it collectively. The five elements of its capability are: the trade surplus that China enjoys with the region; the financial return to China of investments, including loans made to regional countries; the valuable products China is securing from the region such as forestry, petroleum and minerals; political support of Caribbean countries for Chinas interests in international organisations and in the global community; and the regions strategic importance to China because of its proximity to the United States and major maritime trade routes and infrastructure such as the Panama Canal.
Ideally, China should be persuaded to ease its protectionist trade policies and open its market to the 14 independent members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) on a non-reciprocal basis to give the region a chance to narrow the trade surplus. China should also expand its investment in the region to help build much needed infrastructure and to boost sectors such as agriculture, financial services, tourism, sea transportation and manufacturing.
In making such investments, China should also stop making the use of Chinese workers and equipment a condition. As long as this condition continues, the positive impact of these investments on employment will not be fully realised and will fan a flame of resentment.
Of course, the CARICOM countries are divided in relation to China. Five of them continue to have diplomatic ties to Taiwan and this inhibits CARICOM from seeking to establish a structured, long term aid, trade and investment relationship with China. The consequence is that each of the other nine CARICOM members pursues individual relations with China in which they are disadvantaged, but nonetheless grateful. However imperfect loan and investment arrangements might be with China, these governments are, at least, getting monies no other country or agency is advancing to them. Further, the monies are being provided on soft terms.
China is demonstrating a willingness to invest. It is putting huge sums of money into South America as Premier Lis recent tour demonstrates. In the case of the Caribbean, through two Chinese state-owned banks, China Export-Import Bank and China Development Bank, China has disbursed tens of billions of dollars in CARICOM countries since 2005.
But more can be done by China in the Caribbean if a free trade agreement (FTA) with strong provisions for development assistance could be negotiated and established. On his South American tour, Premier Li discussed the possibility of an FTA with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. The matter is, therefore, occupying the minds of Chinas leaders. Undoubtedly, there will be a few South American countries that will conclude such FTAs with China in the near future.
If the Caribbean region is to benefit from Chinas obvious interest in investing its considerable foreign reserves around the world, it has to engage the Chinese government collectively. The reluctance to do so by the five CARICOM countries that continue to gain from their relations with Taiwan is understandable, but they should give their blessings to the other nine member states to strike an enhanced relationship with China while the iron is hot.

News from the Caribbean:
Open letter to the majority shareholders of LIAT
Published onMay 29, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
Gentlemen:
Since before 2012 I have repeatedly heard of calls by the current majority shareholders of LIAT, through Prime Minister Dr Ralph Gonsalves of St Vincent, to take up more shares or to simply contribute towards the airline's losses.
Gentlemen, I can reveal to the press that you know my own name well by now, it has been before you literally hundreds of times both privately through letters, emails, faxes, text messages, and recently in public in the press.
For almost a decade I have been trying to communicate with you mostly for just one reason, and that is to take the politics and non-competence in aviation out of Eastern Caribbean aviation, whether that is at the Civil Aviation Department (or Civil Aviation Authority) level or at the airline level (meaning LIAT).
Example: Barbados is ICAO Category Two for one simple reason  incompetence, lack of proper regulations and lack of oversight. With a little more interest, Barbados could be Category One, but for the last decade nobody has been interested. Last time the FAA visited to conduct an evaluation, when they left they told the Civil Aviation people it was so bad that they ought not to bother to call for the next evaluation for at least another ten years.
But for some five decades LIAT has been abused as much as your own taxpayers for no good reason. Board after board, management after management continue to be politically appointed buffoons  whether they are your "friends" or not  who know little or nothing about aviation (which is NOT the same as tourism) and continue to lose money and market share to the point where the airline is now on the brink of the precipice.
And you need not respond that this is not the case, because if all were well you would not be out in public DEMANDING that other governments join you in throwing money at the existing form of LIAT to keep it alive.
Since at least 2012, Dr Kenny Anthony has told you, in public, that his country's taxpayers would not be supporting LIAT's excesses and that if you wanted St Lucia at the airline's table you had to make major changes in its oversight (board) and management.
Nothing has changed, yet now here you are again making the same demands.
And in the process you are also trying to rope a brand new prime minister into the fold before he can catch his breath after the election. SHAME!
Dr Kenny Anthony asked you from the start to review management  not once, but several times.
Hoteliers through the islands have called for the resignation of Dr Gonsalves and/or the chairman of LIAT  also not once, but several times.
The current board has sailed through screw-up after multi-million dollar loss after "meltdown" after endless delays and cancellations after customer complaints, and there seems to be no responsibility, and no accountability. How can a board and management perform so badly, and yet continue on with "business as usual"  as if disaster after disaster were all perfectly normal?
Let's talk business: My considered forecast is that LIAT has less than two years to exist before either the CDB  or some other creditor group  chains its doors and sells the airplanes for debt. There is good reason for this forecast... LIAT's total passenger load (= income, revenue) in the last year was HALF what it was the year before, yet the expenses remain the same  or even greater, considering the constant arrival/delivery of new airplanes.
As LIAT's light grows dimmer, users of the airline are gladly moving to other carriers, making other arrangements, finding some other way to travel than the still-late, still-cancelled, still-abusive LIAT. Hoteliers are deliberately telling their overseas guests how to get there without touching LIAT. New airlines are starting up and taking market share away, simply because so few people are willing to put up with the LIAT nonsense any more.
I will repeat my simple request to you so that the entire reading public can see it and make up their own minds as to whether I am a raving lunatic or a frustrated professional.
1. Take the politics  and politicians  OUT of LIAT. No more political commissars on the LIAT management payroll drawing a fat salary to ensure some politician's orders are being carried out.
2. Take the political appointees out of LIAT, at all levels. All of them.
3. Remove the entire current board and install new board members composed of intelligent and knowledgeable persons, with the primary required practical knowledge-set of how an airline should be run, give them the basic mandate and let them be the overall deciders of where the airline should be headed.
4. Remove the current executive of LIAT  no matter the cost, given what they are costing the shareholders now  and require the new board to find qualified competent people with drive and imagination who can turn the airline around in less than six months.
5. Make it clear to the board that their mandate is that the airline should at least break even.
6. The board in turn is to make it clear to the executive management that their job is to turn the airline around, and that the airline should at least break even  or that they will lose their jobs. Executive management has no claim to tenure.
7. If the board cannot get management to at least break even, then they will also lose their jobs. A board has no claim to tenure either.
In short, turn LIAT over to real aviation professionals, and demand that they perform or be removed.
Regardless of what PM Gonsalves claims, there can be no doubt whatsoever that LIAT is, in truth and in fact, currently a "black hole" into which he and his partners are throwing away their money. For those too young to know, LIAT did have a subvention scheme before where each government made up their portion of the loss, but that disappeared at one shareholders meeting  in St Lucia  where they all agreed to disagree on the percentages; they all walked out, and LIAT was thrown to the wolves.
I personally have no objection to LIAT going back to a subvention arrangement, for the same reasons stated  multiplier effect, regional inter-island transportation, etc.  but the cost will be so great that most shareholders will repeat the long-ago St Lucia meeting performance and eventually disconnect from the whole sorry and disgusting performance.
I have a final suggestion  and request. While you take LIAT out from under the political bedsheets, also make its annual accounts public, so that the taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars go towards supporting it at are least able to see how their money was spent. And please, don't let us be told again, in no uncertain terms, that LIAT's accounts are "none of our damned business"  the airline is paid for by public money and that public has a right to an accounting.
In my opinion, if LIAT is to survive there is required massive CHANGE at the airline. Change of board, change of management, change of attitude, and change in the way things are done  from the politicians at the top all the way to the employees at the bottom, and very soon.
Gentlemen, the ball is in your court. Change LIAT, or the airline will die. And don't say nobody warned you... I am not the first to make such appeals for sanity and logic when it comes to our once-loved inter-island bus service.
James C. Lynch, Captain (ex-LIAT)

News from the Caribbean:
Chanderpaul sacking distressing, says Guyana sports minister
Published onMay 29, 2015
GEORGETOWN, Guyana (GINA) -- Guyanas minister of education with responsibility for sport, Dr Rupert Roopnaraine, has described the sacking of veteran Guyanese batsmen Shivnarine Chanderpaul from the West Indies cricket squad as distressing.
Minister of Education with responsibility for Sport, Dr Rupert Roopnaraine
The manner of his going, really does no justice to the manner of his performance over the years, and what he has meant to us, Roopnaraine said of the unceremonious and abrupt end to Chanderpauls cricketing career, who spent over two decades playing for the West Indies.
I think that the response of the Guyana Cricket Board was heartedly robust. It clearly is a decision that we in Guyana feel distressed about. Chanderpaul has for so long been a titan on the cricketing scene in the Caribbean and it is difficult right now to even imagine a West Indian team without Chanderpaul, Roopnaraine said.
"we recognise, we notice in his last two series that he has not been himself, he has scored less than he normally does, he has been far less reliable, people were getting him out, which was always a great feat when he is playing well, Roopnaraine acknowledged.
The minister noted however that, if the West Indies selectors felt that Chanderpaul was coming to the end of his career, then some appropriate arrangement should have been made for his final bash.
If you identify, if you say look, Tiger has had a great run, we are going to miss him, but we know he has to go, let him leave in a dignified way make a good preparation for what should have been his final match, so that the West Indian people would have had a chance to salute him in a final farewell. We needed to design something very appropriate, when someone of Chanderpauls value leaves the scene; that was not done, and that is what has been most distressing, he added.
The minister also said that he does not share the view that Chanderpaul should have simply been kept on to overtake Brain Laras record.
I think that Clive Lloyd has been right about that; that is not a good reason. You want to pick your best team to play against Australia, and beat them if you can, at the moment on his current form, he doesnt make it, but my own feeling is that he should have been sent off on the twilight really in a far more dignified way that pays tribute to what he has contributed, he said.
What he has contributed has just been gigantic and that should have been acknowledged, recognised and dealt with appropriately. It has not been dealt with appropriately, he added.
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, 40, was unexpectedly dropped from the West Indies squad for the upcoming home series against Australia. Chanderpaul has 11,867 runs to his name, including 30 centuries and 66 fifties in 164 Tests. He is also just 86 runs short of Brian Laras record for the most ever Test runs for West Indies.
Lara himself has berated the West Indies selector and the WICB for seeking to deny Chanderpaul the chance of a final Test series against Australia and a fitting farewell from the world of cricket.
This has absolutely nothing to do with runs or number, Lara told the Trinidad Guardian. It has to do with respect and Chanderpaul has earned the right to say goodbye in an acceptable way. In fact, he should be allowed to do it in his own way.
Lara also contrasted Chanderpauls fate with that of retired veteran Indian batsmen Sachin Tendulkar, who was granted a specially scheduled Test series at home against West Indies to end his glorious career.

News from the Caribbean:
Trinidad MP arrested; US seeks extradition
Published onMay 28, 2015
Jack Warner
By Caribbean News Now contributor
PORT OF SPAIN, Trinidad -- Following his indictment in the US on eight counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering, Trinidad member of parliament Jack Warner, former regional vice president of FIFA, was arrested and taken into custody on Wednesday afternoon and brought before the chief magistrate where the charges were read to him and he was granted bail in the sum of $2,500,000 (US$395,000) with conditions. Under the treaty between the United States and Trinidad and Tobago, the US now has 60 days to produce a formal request for Warners extradition.
Trinidad and Tobagos Attorney General Garvin Nicholas said that, on Wednesday morning, the Central Authority of Trinidad and Tobago received a request from the US Department of Justice for a provisional arrest warrant for the purposes of Warners extradition.
Attorney General Garvin Nicholas
In keeping with our international obligations, the Central Authority of Trinidad and Tobago immediately facilitated the process to obtain the said warrant, which was issued by the Chief Magistrate, Ms Marcia Ayers-Caesar, Nicholas said in a statement.
According to the attorney general, Wednesdays events were the result of continued successful cooperation between the Central Authority of Trinidad and Tobago and the US Department of Justice, which has spanned a period of approximately two years in respect of the present matter.
The nature of this matter is global in scale. It is therefore expected that this matter would draw not only national but international attention. This matter is however of a very serious and sensitive nature and is now in the hands of the court. I have full confidence in the institutions involved to carry out their roles in a professional and fair manner, Nicholas added.
On Wednesday morning, seven top executives of the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) were arrested in Zurich, Switzerland, as a result of an international investigation conducted by the United States. These seven were among 14 high-ranking officials of FIFA, as well as leading officials of other related soccer governing bodies, indicted on charges in the US.
The allegations arising out of the investigation include bribery, corruption, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering.
Warner was indicted on eight counts including:
a) One count of conspiracy to knowingly agree to conduct or participate in racketeering activity, relating to wire fraud and other offences, which either engages in or affects interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1962(d);

News from the Caribbean:
Guyana's new president defends size of cabinet and renaming of ministries
Published onMay 28, 2015
GEORGETOWN, Guyana (GINA) -- President David Granger has dismissed claims that the new APNU/AFC coalition government in Guyana is a large government, and pointed out that there are fewer ministries than those under the previous administration.
President David Granger
It is the amalgamation of the ministries that would have created concerns, the president said. I have not created a larger number of ministries than existed before; there are now fewer than there were before, as far as the names are concerned, I have explained that some of the changes in name were to emphasise the functions.
Citing one example, the president pointed out that the ministry of the presidency always existed as it is merely the renaming of the Office of the President.
I felt it necessary to have a minister of state, who would continue to act authoritatively to ensure that the Cabinet decisions are implemented throughout the government service, Granger explained.
Explaining the name change of the ministry of local government to ministry of communities, Granger said, We are not simply building houses or building roads, we are building communities where human beings live and that is why it was renamed to emphasise the human aspect of local development, local government, of regional government and of housing schemes and water supply.
The new head of state stressed the need to see places where citizens dwell, not just a collection of buildings, but a collection of families, so that emphasis can be placed on sporting facilities, culture and other types of community life. These and more, the president said, are more often than not absent from newly developed housing schemes across the country.
The renaming of the ministry of home affairs to the ministry of public security, the president said is self-explanatory: What does home affairs mean? Home affairs is an old title which is taken from the British Empire, they had foreign affairs which dealt with international matters and home affairs, but we do not have an empire, so why should we call it home affairs?
Likewise the ministry of public infrastructure from the ministry of public works is also self-explanatory as it caters to infrastructure for public use, and will be dealing with stellings, roadways and bridges.
Meanwhile, responding to the issue of no consultations being held before the renaming of some of the ministries, Granger said, There is a lot of criticism, but some of it is not well informed. The ministry of indigenous peoples (affairs), the indigenous people said that they prefer to be called indigenous peoples rather than to be called Amerindians.
With regard to the appointments, he said, I had to have some consultations before the appointments were made; I could not sit down by myself and make Mr Ramjattan a vice president.

More Caribbean governments should invest in LIAT, say regional PMs
Published onMay 28, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
By Ken Richards
BASSETERRE, St Kitts (WINN) -- Vincentian Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves and Antigua and Barbudas Prime Minister Gaston Brown have urged Caribbean governments that are not major shareholders of regional airline LIAT to change that status by giving meaningful financial support to the airline.
St Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves
Both made that appeal at last weeks CDB sponsored seminar on making air transport work better for the Caribbean. Gonsalves spoke in his capacity as chairman of the group of shareholder governments of LIAT.
Browne said, while LIAT must seek to improve its operations, the airline needs to be subsidized, arguing that LIAT is making a significant contribution to the integration process and should be supported by the governments of the region.
Its not clear what the position of the new Team Unity administration in St Kitts and Nevis on LIAT will be. Former prime minister Denzil Douglas said his government had in its last six months in office been taking a critical look at the LIAT problem.
Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Brown
Douglas said under consideration was the use of the Sugar Industry Diversification Fund (SIDF) funds to help Basseterre become a major shareholder of LIAT.
A CDB commissioned study on the regional airline industry proposes the setting up a Caribbean Community (CARICOM) airlines association to identify opportunities to reduce cost, create greater synergies and earn more revenue.

ECLAC study on foreign direct investment puts focus on Caribbean
Published onMay 28, 2015
SANTIAGO, Chile -- The Caribbean receives higher amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI) when compared to other developing economies, according to a newly published report from the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC).
ECLAC Executive Secretary, Alicia Brcena
Entitled Foreign Direct Investment in Latin America and the Caribbean, the flagship report was launched by ECLAC executive secretary, Alicia Brcena, on 27 May at the organizations headquarters in Santiago, Chile.
For the first time, the flagship report dedicates an entire chapter to FDI in the Caribbean, thus placing increased emphasis on the importance of FDI for the region. FDI inflows into the Caribbean amounted to approximately five percent of GDP in 2014, compared to three percent for Latin America, and less in other developing regions.
In the Caribbean, FDI is important both as a source of funds for development and as a source of foreign exchange. Nevertheless, questions remain about the extent to which these flows contribute to growth and development in the Caribbean.
Given the increasing propensity of many large Caribbean transnationals to make significant cross-border investments, the report looks at outward FDI from Caribbean countries to regional and extra-regional economies.
The publication discusses recent developments in key sectors, which either attract the most FDI inflows or possess potential for increased FDI. Examples include tourism, natural resources, manufacturing, business process outsourcing, financial services, and offshore education. Potential benefits and drawbacks of FDI are examined.
The report provides an analysis of the modalities commonly utilized by Latin American and Caribbean countries to attract and leverage FDI. It also looks at the extent to which these methods attract FDI, which contributes to economic growth and sustainable development.

Caribbean to improve climate resilience with US$10 million programme
Published onMay 28, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
WASHINGTON, USA -- The Caribbean region will increase its resilience to climate change by enhancing the adaptive capacity across the region through a US$10.39 million grant approved by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) through support from the pilot programme for climate resilience (PPCR) of the Climate Investment Funds (CIF).
The project is to be executed by the Mona Office of Research and Innovation (MORI), University of the West Indies (UWI) in Jamaica and will be co-implemented by regional organizations working on climate change in the region, including the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC); Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH), Climate Change Studies Group of UWI, Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA), Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI), and the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM).
The project is the implementation of the investment plan for the Caribbean regional track of the PPCR, and it will help the Caribbean region improve regional processes of climate relevant data acquisition, storage, analysis, access, transfer and dissemination, and pilot and scale up innovative climate resilient initiatives directly in PPCR countries  Jamaica, Haiti, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia and St Vincent and the Grenadines.
However, it is expected that the region as a whole will benefit from the improved capacity and increased information and services related to climate change.
The project will focus on: (i) Improving geospatial data and management for adaptation planning, sea level rise and storm surge impact analyses  the use of radar in bathymetric and coastal topographic analysis will be a key activity; (ii) Consolidating and expanding the regional climate network and global platform linkages  improvements in the acquisition of weather data and climate services will be key activities; (iii) Downscaling and expanded climate projection models and high resolution maps  improvements to and enhancement of the downscaled future climate projections in the Caribbean in support of adaptation planning, decision making, and sector level modeling/projection efforts will be key activities ; and (iv) the application of adaptation initiatives utilizing the information generated as part of the project in the areas of health, agriculture, marine resources, water and climate change policies.
There will be a strong emphasis on disseminating the lessons learned and information generated from the implementation of the project activities as well as the information related to the benefits of the PPCR approach in building climate resilience to countries in the Caribbean.
Thanks to this programme, the Caribbean will build on its historical regional approach to addressing the impacts of climate change and strengthen adaptation efforts across the region, providing an example for other regions globally.
The US$10 million grant is a five year program and will be supervised by the Climate Change and Sustainability Division within the Infrastructure and Environment Sector Department of the IDB.

Haiti to get US$50m grant for cleaner water and better sanitation in cholera hot spots
Published onMay 28, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
WASHINGTON, USA -- About 300,000 people from Haitis cholera-affected rural areas and small towns will benefit from increased access to clean water and sanitation as a result of a US$50 million grant from the International Development Association (IDA) approved on Wednesday by the board of directors of the World Bank.
The sustainable rural and small towns water and sanitation project aims to save lives by preventing cholera and waterborne diseases in high prevalence zones, and strengthen the capacity of local agencies to deliver water and sanitation services in rural areas and small towns.
Haiti has made progress in controlling the cholera epidemic since the 2010 outbreak, with reported case numbers decreasing from a monthly average of more than 30,000 in 2011 to about 2,200 cases per month in 2014. However, due to heavy rains, cases rose sharply in the first quarter of 2015, to a monthly average of 3,400 cases. While deaths from cholera and waterborne diseases declined last year and remain below one percent of cases, cholera resurgence remains a threat and water borne diseases are one of the leading causes of infant mortality in the country.
We hear a lot in Haiti that Water is life. With this project we have an opportunity to make this a reality for hundreds of thousands of Haitians, said Benito Dumay, director general of the National Water and Sanitation Directorate - DINEPA. This project supports the governments ten-year cholera elimination plan and aims to prevent thousands more Haitian children from dying from waterborne diseases.
Wednesdays grant is part of an encompassing World Bank initiative that builds on the immediate emergency response after the outbreak in 2010, which benefited more than three million people through prevention education campaigns, training of community health workers and medical personnel, and direct treatment. It also complements cholera prevention and treatment efforts for US$20 million under an ongoing health project focused on epidemiological surveillance and treatment.
The World Bank said it is committed to mobilize donors and other partners to join forces in substantially improving water and sanitation coverage in Haiti, and strengthening health services.
Despite much progress in Haitis fight on cholera, too many people are still getting sick, mainly because they dont have access to clean water and sanitation systems. This is even more vital in rural areas where less than one in two Haitians have access to safe drinking water and only 16 percent have access to improved sanitation, said Mary Barton-Dock, World Bank special envoy. By improving water and sanitation coverage in these targeted areas, we are not only saving lives, but also helping reduce poverty and improve livelihood opportunities of these communities.
The new project will target priority communes with high cholera incidence rates in the dry season. It will reinforce and complement the activities carried out by other local and international partners in the country, and will have an impact across the Island of Hispaniola and on the border with the Dominican Republic, including bi-national markets.
Among the concrete results to be achieved are:
 150,000 people will gain access to improved water sources through household connections and water kiosks;
 50,000 people will benefit from improved sanitation through community-led sanitation campaigns, hygiene promotion, and construction of latrines in schools, health centers, markets and other public spaces;
 100,000 people will benefit from small repairs and expansions;
 A roadmap for universal access to water and sanitation by 2030 will be developed.
 A regional surveillance system for pandemics will be designed with support from the government of the Dominican Republic.
This six-year project will be implemented by DINEPA under the ministry of public works, transport and communications (MTPTC).
World Bank Group response to cholera
The World Banks International Development Association (IDA) has been financing cholera response activities since the outbreak in the end of 2010. It disbursed US$15 million as part of a cholera emergency response project, which closed in March 2014. More than three million people benefited from prevention education campaigns, training, and direct treatment through the project. Specifically, more than 5,400 community health workers and medical personnel were trained.
In addition to Wednesdays US$50 million grant, the World Bank has made US$20 million available to the ministry of health for cholera prevention and treatment under a new health project (total US$90 million) for epidemiological surveillance, treatment, including rapid response mobile teams, hygiene and health promotion, and water and sanitation activities. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has also supported DLO Haiti, which is developing a network of water kiosks where water is purified and distributed to nearby communities at an affordable price.
In collaboration with the government of Haiti, the UN and development partners, the World Bank also hosted an international round table to discuss best practices and lessons learned on combating cholera, and a high profile conference in Washington DC to bring attention to the financing gap.

British Virgin Islands to host regional parliamentary conference
Published onMay 28, 2015
Email To Friend  Print Version
By Linton Leonard
ROAD TOWN, BVI -- The British Virgin Islands (BVI) will host the 40th annual conference of the Caribbean, Americas and the Atlantic Region of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA).
Over 70 parliamentarians drawn from member states of that body are expected to arrive in the BVI in July as delegates and observers to this annual event. The opening of the conference will take place on July 27, 2015 under the theme: Promoting Democracy and Good Governance: A Unified Approach. Deliberations will take place from July 25 until August 1.
According to the clerk of the House of Assembly and conference coordinator, Phyllis Evans, the theme is relevant, given the challenging democratic circumstances being currently faced by member states.
Evans said, It will allow parliamentarians to get together to share perspectives, which may well be different, given their unique circumstances. I believe we can learn from each other and explore ways of tackling these problems.
Evans stated that the CPA conference is also being held at a critical point in the history of the BVI, at the implementation of the National Youth Policy that includes the creation of the Virgin Islands Youth Commission, the National Youth Council and the National Youth Parliament.
The 40th annual conference will include the eighth conference of Commonwealth women parliamentarians, the regional executive committee meeting, plenary sessions, the annual general meeting and the regional youth parliament.
A two-day meeting of the regional sub-group of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (CWP) will precede the main conference. The female parliamentarians will discuss topics including Strategies to Increase Womens Representation in Parliaments.
Delegations to the regional CPA will include participants who will also participate in the annual session of the Caribbean Youth Parliament.
During the launch of the National Youth Policy on April 27, 2015, minister for education and culture, Myron Walwyn, stated that, as early as July, the youth of the territory will have the opportunity to take ownership of the youth policy as they participate in the upcoming sitting of the Commonwealth Youth Parliament at the CPA meeting to be held in the BVI.
The minister added that the youth parliament will enable young people across the territory to develop their skills and advocate meaningfully on different platforms and themes that impact them.
Walwyn further stated, The Parliament contributes to a strong and secure territory by developing our young people and by their participation, allowing them to mature as politically accountable and responsible citizens, grounded in a civic consciousness, national identity, democracy and the rule of law, and respect for rights and diversity."
The purpose of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association branches of the Caribbean, the Americas and the Atlantic Region is to provide a forum to promote the aims and objectives and implement the activities of CPA CAA and the branches in the region.
The aims and objectives of the association are to promote knowledge of the respective constitutions, as well as the legislative, economic, social and cultural aspects of parliamentary democracy, with particular reference to the Commonwealth countries in the region.
Member states of the CPA include Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Trinidad and Tobago, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, the Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

Let's Talk Business: There is never enough time in a day, or is there?
Published onMay 28, 2015

By Billie Bowe
Its odd that I would choose this topic to write about, as I would be the first to utter the words, There is never enough time in a day! A day in the life of Billie Bowe looks a little like this: get up, shower, take daughter to school, attend client meetings, write articles for three columns, conduct interviews, send emails, return phone calls, prepare for speaking engagements, network, conduct corporate training, pick up daughter from school, volunteer in my community, remember to eat, practice my golf swing, and the list goes on and on. Before I can unpack my luggage after returning home from a business trip, I am off again sitting on another plane heading to another destination. It can certainly drive one insane. So when it comes to time management, it is a struggle Id admit, and I would imagine I am not the only one.
Billie Bowe has been a successful senior manager in human resources for the private sector for more than ten years and is the president and CEO of Benchmark Consulting Services Ltd , a management consulting firm, in Freeport, Grand Bahama. Email: bbowe@bcsbahamas.com
There is a phrase that says, you cant eat an elephant in one sitting; well thats the essence of this article, which by the way is due today! As I offer tips to my readers on how to better manage their time, I am giving myself some sage advice as well. I am learning right along with you. There has to be a way to accomplish what needs to be done in a day without wanting to run off to some secluded island where there are no phones, Internet, or even human beings.
Here are five things WE can start doing today to manage our daily tasks, plans, schedules, whatever it is, in order to be more efficient:
1. Use technology  we have smartphones, computers, and tablets; all of which have awesome apps to help us stay organized. I can name many but really it depends on your personal preference. One of the things I do now to help me shave some time off my hectic schedule is record tons of voice notes on my mobile phone. Especially for my writing assignments. Once Ive recorded the key points, then I can write without having to waste time thinking of a topic or staring at a blank page. I do this when preparing speeches; training presentations, even email correspondences. And when do I it? Dont ask. Sometimes its while I am driving (safely of course) or waiting for my daughter to emerge from the schoolyard, or most often on a plane. And what about those tasks that are necessary but can take a lot of time, like banking and paying bills? It amazes me when I see how many people are still paying their bills in person. Just about every major company allows online bill pay. Due to my immense dislike for long lines, I do 90 percent of my banking online.
2. Take it day-by-day and not week-by-week  using the analogy of the elephant, we must be realistic about what we can actually accomplish in a day. Now this takes discipline but the benefits are awesome. Take it one day at a time. There is no sense in trying to cram 15 things in one workday when we can prioritize and narrow it down to five. Youll be surprised as to how easy it is to accomplish. I tend to think of the entire week when, instead, just focusing on one day and fewer tasks, I have a better chance of ensuring that I complete those assignments on time. Youre probably thinking, easier said than done right? But give it try.
3. Delegate  whenever possible find tasks to delegate that can lighten your workload. But be careful of this. Delegating is not about dumping the things you dont want to do off to someone else, especially in the work environment. Delegating is meant to be a learning experience for the person being delegated to. This takes practice but can truly reap awesome rewards, allowing you to focus on the bigger picture. You may be asking what if I have no one to delegate to. I have no silver bullet solution for this, however, all I can say is perhaps we havent really taken an inventory as to exactly how we currently spend our time. There may very well be tasks that can be delegated if only we pause and take stock. Who knows, you may find that you are spending time doing something that has nothing to do with accomplishing the task or goal at hand. In my business, I try to think of time in segments. For example, allotting time for income generating activities. If I am doing more maintenance and not lead generation, then my business could plateau. Not good for a consultant.
4. Ask for help  this is one I often struggle with. Unlike delegating, which in the business context is meant to allow for the transfer of skills from one to another, asking for help is a totally different ballgame. There is no shame in asking for help when needed. A trend that is becoming increasingly popular for businesses is outsourcing. If you find a company that you can outsource to, then do it. An example may be recruiting, especially for SMEs (small and medium enterprises). If you consider the cost (in time and money) of you trying to recruit someone, place ads, review resumes and applications, screen candidates in and out, there is likely a company that can handle that process for you. It may be well worth it in the end and you may even have a broader talent pool to access as recruitment firms typically have a pool of potential candidates from which to feed from.
5. Give yourself a break  when we rush about like chickens without heads, what are we really accomplishing? Speaking from experience, if I dont pause or just say no when asked to do something that I full well know cant fit into my schedule, I wind up with a lot of unfinished business. My solution to this problem is for one, start saying no when it really is necessary to do so. Secondly, there is no substitute for getting a good nights rest. If I am frazzled because my plate is too full, I never finish my meal. In the same vein, if we dont take care of our body, which is a biological machine that requires fuel to operate, it will break down. Then what? If youre not around or at your optimal performance level because youve run your body down, then chances are the quality of your work and life will suffer as a result.
I started out by saying that I have to take my own advice. It is a work in progress; it requires discipline that comes with practice. As a wife, mother, daughter, sister, friend, employer and business owner, it is critical that I manage my time effectively. The thing to remember is youre not the only one trying to manage time. That meeting you had to postpone due to time constraints may actually be grateful that you did, as they too cant find enough time in a day. Now isnt that ironic!

Commentary: Prepare, the Ingrahamites are near!

By Youri Kemp
Ever since the opposition party in The Bahamas, the Free National Movement, elected their leader, Dr Hubert Minnis, in a snap mini-convention and with Dr Minnis having staved off and cut off a surging challenge from his fellow opposition member of parliament colleague, Mrs Loretta Butler-Turner, his leadership has been met with fierce criticism from persons within his own party. Most of which are from a small, but yet powerful faction of persons loyal to their former leader and former prime minister of The Bahamas, the Right Honourable Hubert Ingraham.
Youri Kemp is president and CEO of Kemp Global, a management consultancy firm, based in The Bahamas, which serves all markets. Email: globalviewtoday@gmail.com
None more prominent in the cacophony of discontent within the Free National Movement with their leadership is that of the former deputy prime minister under Mr Ingraham, Frank Watson.
Mr Watson has said that the current leader of the FNM is tone-deaf to his and other's suggestions on how the party should proceed. He also said that the party is in serious problems if Dr Minnis's current style of management continues. He was directly quoted as saying that the current chairman of the FNM is "talking nonsense" and that the chairman is "out of the loop" with the real players in the party. And that was just last week!
Without a doubt Mr Ingraham has left an indelible mark on Bahamian politics. The first prime minister in the era post the near invincible Sir Lynden Pindling, and having served three terms to boot. Quite a feat in a modern and fair democratic government process for anyone from anywhere in the world to have served as leader for more than ten years, whether consecutively or non-consecutively.
Of course, this means that there are a lot of people that are very, very loyal to Mr Ingraham. No doubt, he has in fact helped a great deal of people. He also had an uncanny knack for placing people in strategic positions in the public and private sector, persons who have been able to maintain and make valuable contributions to our country.
However, as with many a leader in democratic, and not-so-democratic fashion, the love affair between them and the people often goes sour after it becomes stale and methods become ineffective. Good enough for us that his departure from front line politics was met with peaceful transition, and not with a coup or some form of violence. I am proud to be a Bahamian on that score. Truly.
Mr Ingraham was beaten by his immediate predecessor and his successor to his first term in office. To be succinct: the current prime minister, the Right Honourable Perry Christie, had a one term stint in between Mr Ingraham's terms of service. Mr Christie won in 2002, lost in 2007 and then won again in 2012.
What's also a pretty well known fact is that Mr Christie and Mr Ingraham share a very funny distinction: They were both fired as cabinet ministers at the same time on the same day in the same circumstances under the Sir Lynden Pindling government.
Without labouring through the oftentimes murky and gossipy reasons as to why they were fired, to cut a long story short, Mr Christie and Mr Ingraham ran as independents in that subsequent election that the governing party, the Progressive Liberal Party, won, with Mr Christie opting to go back to the PLP and Mr Ingraham opting to go with the FNM and then becoming prime minister in 1992.
Sure enough, along with that distinction, they also, as reports claim, share a close bond and friendship. They were former law partners in addition to standing as godparents for each other's children. They also share the same small group of friends and associates.
Leading anyone who does not fall into the spell of the occult-like style of politics in The Bahamas: We have essentially been ruled and governed by the same small group of people for over the last 20 plus years.
Regardless of what anyone tells you, even with a strong man like Mr Ingraham: No one runs a country by themselves. All strong leaders, and more so with not-so-strong leaders, have supporters, cronies, lackeys, bag men, go to guys, key writers, image makers, covert operatives and public relations gurus that all play a part in making them look on the ball, as well as their relational associates and family ties that hold them down, at all times.
To go even further with this relationship that both men share, during the 2007 campaign and at a campaign rally when Mr Ingraham won that election year, Mr Ingraham remarked in a quite jovial, but yet sneering and mocking manner, at a point where then sitting prime minister Christie, during a time where he had fallen ill and had to take an indeterminate time of leave, had asked him to "run" the cabinet and the country until he had time to convalesce and get back on his game. By-passing his then deputy, Cynthia "Mother" Pratt and the rest of his cabinet ministers in the PLP.
So, essentially the "Ingrahamites" aren't just near, they probably never left. Which is quite important for our country, because as mentioned previously: Ideas, ways of doing business, methods, people and their minds become stale and ineffective. While continuity is important, quite frankly, when you look at our daunting issues: Who wishes that?
When you sit in one spot for too long you become immune and blind to what's around you. You don't see "the problems", you just continue with your solutions which you feel worked 20 years ago and so they must work today. This is even worse for those that are eating their fair-square three meals a day and have no worries about those meals tomorrow.
This clearly suggests, at least over the last ten years, the same solutions have not been productive or user friendly. To say the very least.
With all of that being said, however, I think this is a perfect time to hear from former prime minister Ingraham.
The way he left after the 2012 election was, to put it quite mildly, abrupt, seemingly callous and a little selfish. It was like the Bahamian taxpayers werent allowing him a salary and leeway to do what it is he was charged to do. This was a lot worse than the first time he left the scene, more or less, at the height of a mild recession after he had lost in 2002. The state of affairs then was not "this bad".
The country has not fully recovered since the 2008 global recession. Unemployment is still stubbornly up; the ease of doing business rankings are slipping; investment, both local and foreign, is not vibrant and with the latter we need less of and more of the former; crime is still miles high; public services are still reeling from the ravages of the recession and morale is low because more burdens were placed on them; and the overall sentiment from Bahamians is one of hopelessness amidst waves and waves of missteps and oversights that turned into full-blown fiascos under the current administration, all at a time when we need concerned and concerted consistency and clarity on all fronts.
I mentioned to one of my colleagues just recently that I would like to hear from Mr Ingraham about all and sundry, regardless of how it looks now: From the current state of the economy, the way we look internationally, how he feels businesses can be better served, how the small and not-so-small can better integrate themselves into the process he left behind and his overall outlook on his party, the FNM and the fighting that is looking very, very nasty.
To be fair, he did not give us our just due as citizens in giving a full account of his tenure. A de-briefing, of sorts.
Even a very prominent businessman, Franklyn Wilson of Arawak Homes, feels the same way as I do. He too also wants to know, and in particular, why did Mr Ingraham leave South Eleuthera at such a disadvantage as Mr Wilson has lamented in one of his recent discussions with reporters.
Some have suggested, and this is probably why persons like Mr. Ingraham's former deputy Frank Watson and a few others have been getting antsy and vocal as of late, that Mr Ingraham is planning a comeback. Stronger than when many feel he usurped power of the FNM from leader elect Tommy Turnquest and put his name in the hat at the FNM's convention leading up to the 2007 general election.
I can only laugh, especially considering all we know now and all we read in only this submission. Laugh because Mr Ingraham, Mr Watson and the others loyal to the Ingrahamite cause, if this is the case, may as well come out as full, card carrying members of the governing PLP. That ought to make this into the full scale spectacle that those and sundry want us to be embroiled in and one that it appears to be.
One of my colleagues, a very seasoned man and one who was in the mix back in the day and knows both Mr Christie and Mr Ingraham very well, assured me that both men speak to each other on a regular basis on governing The Bahamas and that Mr Ingraham's input is seen and felt every day. I can believe that! **sips tea**

Commentary: Garifuna leaders meet with St Vincent opposition leader in New York

By Wellington C. Ramos
In 1797, after the British finally defeated the Garifuna people after years of resistance, they removed them from their native homeland Yurumein, now known as St Vincent and the Grenadines, to Baliceaux, an adjacent island.
Born in Dangriga Town, the cultural capital of Belize, Wellington Ramos has BAs in Political Science and History from Hunter College, NY, and an MA in Urban Studies from Long Island University. He is an Adjunct Professor of Political Science and History
On this island, after their Garifuna nation was dismantled, they were imprisoned, tortured, killed and the survivors, estimated about 5,000, were taken to Roatan, Honduras, where they landed on April 12 of that same year. Many Garifuna people disliked the conditions on this island and appealed to the British to find a better place for them.
In 1801, some of these Garifuna people, numbering about 150, left Roatan and sailed to Belize. They were granted permission by the British to settle in the southern part of Belize in a town they named Dangriga. In 1823, after the slaughtering of some Garifuna men, women and children in San Juan, Honduras, a large contingent of Garifuna people, led by Elijio Beni and Satulle, left the country to join their people in Dangriga, where they live up to this day. The British also made a deal with the Spanish crown and some of them were allowed to settle along the coast of Honduras.
During these negotiations most of their names were changed from their original names to Spanish names to hide their true identities. During the nationalist and civil wars in Honduras, many Garifuna people fought in these battles and were killed. As a result of these wars and the British occupation of Bluefield, Nicaragua, some Garifuna people migrated to neighbouring Nicaragua, Guatemala, Belize and later on to the United States.
No matter which country the Garifuna people live, they all identify themselves with their motherland Yurumein. It is and remains the dream of all the Garinagu people in the Diaspora that one day the people and government of their motherland Yurumein will acknowledge their rights to this nation as theirs as well.
Garifuna peoples intentions has never been and will never be to deny citizenship and rights of all their brothers and sisters who became citizens of Yurumein after March 11, 1797. Why? Because the Garifuna peoples history has always been to stand up and fight for the injustices committed against other human beings.
This was why they risked their lives and died fighting against the Spanish, French and British in what is known as the Carib Wars. Not only did they fight against these powerful nations but they also stole their slaves and brought them to Yurumein to live with them as one people. The leaders of the Garifuna organization shared their history, the current state of affairs in all the countries where they live today and their constant struggle to be accepted as citizens to freely practice their culture without government interference.
Also discussed were current human rights violations in some of these countries, especially Honduras, such as health, education, poverty, inadequate and lack of political representation, environment, farming fishing, cooperative, autonomy, unlawful detention, imprisonment, lots, lands, economic development, unequal distribution of their nations wealth were all brought to the leader of the oppositions attention.
The leader was taking notes and listened keenly to what was being relayed to him. He was shocked, amazed, appalled, disgusted and angry by some of the testimonies he was hearing from his Garifuna brothers and sisters. He said to them, My political party, namely, the New Democratic Party (NDP), and myself held an executive meeting before I departed to the United States and agreed to take a bold stand on issues related to our Garifuna people in the Diaspora countries.
All the delegates present were delighted when they heard this statement.
In our Garifuna culture our ancestors and the elders have always warned us about favouring one political party over the other because it will be used to divide us as a people. In Honduras, most of our people tend to support the Liberal Party and when the Nationalist Party becomes the new government they are hostile to our people.
In Nicaragua, some of our people were with President Ortega and became victims when he was removed from power. Today, he is back in power and they are trying to get back their lands that were taken away from them under the previous governments.
Garifuna people in Guatemala mostly live in the town of Labuga, in English meaning Livingston, and Puerto Barrios. The number of Garifuna people living in Guatemala is not large. Plus, Guatemala is known for having military coups so their votes will play no role in elections.
In the beginning of Belizes history most of our people like the other ethnic groups supported the oldest political party, namely, the Peoples United Party (PUP). Then later on they started to support the United Democratic Party (UDP). Garifuna people in Belize tend to vote more for the candidate than the party. However, as time went by, the Garifuna people have seen very little return coming from these two parties but false promises so they change these parties from time to time.
Some Garifuna individuals and an organization in Belize are only in politics to promote themselves, their self interest and not their people. They are harmful to their people because once they become insulated in these political parties and they cannot speak out against their party policies that affect their people. I just hope and pray that this is not the same in Yurumein St Vincent and the Grenadines and the other countries where our people reside. Most Garifuna people in the United States support the Democratic Party.
This coming Sunday, May 30, 2015, there will be a town hall meeting, where the leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, Honourable Arnhim Eustace, will be making a proclamation on behalf of his Garifuna brothers and sisters who live in the Diaspora. The meeting will be held at the Friends of Crown Heights Hall located at 671 Prospect Place in Brooklyn between Franklin and Bedford Avenue at 5:00 pm.
The Garifuna organizations are calling on all their people to come and witness this historic event. Why? Because we have never heard what the position of this political party was when it comes to us, only what we were told by the other main party. It is always wise to listen to both sides before we come to a conclusion.
We have heard the position of the current party (ULP) that has been in power in St Vincent under Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves for 14 years now, and have been given several promises but none of them has materialized. Promises undelivered in 14 years are unacceptable to our brave men and women who are living because of the sacrifices our ancestors made with their lives to make us exist. One year is too long to be waiting on anything much less 14 years.
We do not have that kind of patience and so should you my people. There is a famous saying that goes, A promise is a comfort to a fool. Our people are not fools because we know what we want and we are willing to fight for it. We will be looking forward to see you all at the town hall meeting on Sunday to hear this proclamation.
