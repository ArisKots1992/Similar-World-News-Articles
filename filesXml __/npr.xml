The man who died of Lassa fever flew from West Africa to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.

This week a man died in New Jersey of a hemorrhagic fever. This by itself is fairly unusual in the Garden State. Making the case even more odd was that the man was being monitored for Ebola by New Jersey health officials and the case should have been caught earlier.
The events expose a hole in a public health system meant to track potential Ebola cases.
Back In D.C. From The Ebola Hot Zone, I Broke Out In A Fever
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, he was screened for Ebola when he landed and did not have a fever. Along with everyone else arriving from what's designated as an Ebola-affected country, he was ordered to undergo a 21-day monitoring program by his local health department. He was supposed to report his temperature daily and notify county health authorities if he got a fever.
When his temperature surged the day after he landed, he didn't follow that plan. Instead he went to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey.
"According to the hospital, he had been asked whether he had been in West Africa and said no," says Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the CDC. "And there would be no reason to think of a viral hemorrhagic fever in someone who doesn't have a travel history."
The hospital would have had no clue as to his travel history. The Ebola monitoring system does not alert local hospitals that someone on Ebola-watch is in their vicinity and might walk through their doors.
The doctors at St. Barnabas gave the man antibiotics and sent him home.
As the man's condition deteriorated, it's not exactly clear what happened. A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health declined a request for an interview about this case, saying it's still under investigation. She did, however, say the man was "actively" being monitored. But if the man had been lying to his case manager about his temperature or other symptoms, officials would have no way to know he was sick.
Laurie Garrett is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of The Coming Plague . She speculates that "if this had been an Ebola case, if the individual had gone to a hospital and not acknowledged that he'd been in Liberia and it had turned out to be Ebola, that would indeed have been a major failure of the screening system and potentially very dangerous to his health care providers."
What the man did have was Lassa fever , a hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola and common in West Africa. He returned to the hospital three days after his first visit. That's when he acknowledged that he'd been in Liberia. He was then transferred to an isolation unit at University Hospital in Newark.
The man died four days later.
Garrett says that going back to the time of the Black Death, communities have struggled with what measures are appropriate to keep diseases at bay.
"It has always been a fine line to figure out what are the protective measures that will work and how far you should go in abrogating the civil liberties of individuals," she says.
So the question is: Do you quarantine everyone coming off the plane or do you take them at their word?
Since October, more than 17,000 people across the U.S. have been monitored for Ebola after returning from West Africa. None of them came down with it.
New Jersey officials are now monitoring anyone who had close contact with the Lassa victim, including healthcare workers, for possible signs of the disease.

Health workers collect the body of a cholera victim in Petionville, Haiti, February 2011. The cholera outbreak in Haiti began in October 2010. Nearly 9,000 people have died.
David Gilkey/NPR
At a government-run clinic in Diquini, near Port-au-Prince, doctors are treating a handful of cholera patients.
One of them is Givenchi Predelus. For five days, the high school sophomore has been lying on a cot with a towel over his midsection and an IV in his arm, listening to tinny music on his bare-bones cellphone.
Why Cholera Persists In Haiti Despite An Abundance Of Aid
Predelus speaks in a whisper, a sign of what cholera has done to his strength. "Only one other person in my area has cholera," he says, through an interrupter. "She sells patties on the side of the road. I'm the second victim."
Cholera causes profuse diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to death by dehydration, sometimes within a matter of hours.
An unusually early start to the rainy season has brought a spike in the waterborne bacteria  and thus the number of infections. In the first four months of this year, the number of reported cholera cases was nearly 400 percent higher than that reported in the same period in 2014.
This outbreak in Haiti has been ongoing since October 2010  10 months after the catastrophic earthquake . So far, nearly 9,000 people have died, and more than 730,000 have been infected.
After Bringing Cholera To Haiti, U.N. Plans To Get Rid Of It
Scientific studies show that U.N. peacekeepers from Nepal likely imported the bacteria causing the outbreak in 2010. The U.N. says it's committed to eradicating cholera from Haiti, but it hasn't accepted responsibility for inadvertently introducing the disease.
An unprecedented surge in cholera cases at the end of the last year and a harsh, early start to the rains mean this year will be bleak, says Oliver Schulz, who, until last week, led Doctors Without Borders' mission in Haiti.
Some illegal behavior could be contributing to the spread of the disease, Schulz says. "People [are] breaking the official water pipes to illegally take the water," he says. "There's the risk of contamination. If you have an open water pipe on the ground, and there's a heavy rain, perhaps there's a latrine nearby that floods into the pipe, and it contaminates the whole system."
5 Years After Haiti's Earthquake, Where Did The $13.5 Billion Go?
More than 15,000 people have been infected and another 126 have died this year, says Haiti's health ministry.
But despite the grim totals, the number are slowing. The health ministry says 2,400 cases were reported last month, which is down from 4,000 in January.
Back at the cholera treatment center, a man rushes in with his 1-year-old daughter. She already has an IV in her arm. She is vomiting, and workers rush to surround her metal cot with buckets.
Workers at a clinic near the man's home sent him and his daughter by motorcycle taxi here because the clinic is better equipped than the one nearby.
Across the room, Rinel Mathurin holds her 3-year old daughter, Williana, who after three days of treatment can finally sit up.
Rinel says the center staff told her to watch Williana's interactions with other kids to avoid spreading infections  and to purify the home's water to keep other kids safe.
"We need to treat the water we drink with chlorine tabs," Rinel says through an interrupter. "We need to clean the house with Clorox. We need to buy chlorine tabs."
But chlorine tabs at the market cost money, she says. And she's not sure she can afford them.

        <Description>A decade ago, fishermen trying to catch North Sea cod were coming up empty. Now, thanks to strict fishing rules put in place to halt the decline, this fish tale looks headed for a happy ending.</Description>

Cod love the icy cold waters of the North Sea  and British people love eating cod.
But a decade ago, it looked like people were eating the fish to the brink of collapse. Now the trend has turned around, and the cod are coming back.
We pick up this fish tale, which seems to be on its way to a happy ending, at an early morning fish auction in Fraserburgh, Scotland, where buyers and sellers are lined up alongside hundreds of boxes containing cod, hake, monkfish, sole and every other kind of fish you can imagine from the North Sea.
This auction is not a place for fancy chefs and home cooks. The sales are in bulk, and most of the buyers and sellers here come from generations of fishermen. Like market superintendent Ian Buchan  he spent most of his life at sea, until it became just too hard to catch fish.
"People were saying there was no cod. Ten years before I stopped, at least 150 miles to get fish. Now, 20 miles. Fish is everywhere," Buchan says.
Everywhere.

"We've seen a big explosion in the cod and hake," says Alan Mutch, who runs the fish salesmen's association here. "We're definitely seeing an upsurge in that. And in fact, now vessels  because of the restrictions on the amount they're allowed to land  vessels now have to steam to other areas to get away from cod."
This is a huge turnaround from just a decade ago, says Robin Cook , a scientist who used to run the region's fisheries research center. He's now with Strathclyde University in Glasgow.
"Through much of my career, many of the stocks in European waters were in decline. And things were getting worse and worse and worse," Cook says.
Back then, Cook was the go-to expert for stories on fishery collapse. He was quoted in programs with titles like Goodbye Fish and Chips and Costing the earth  In Cod We Trust.
Whereas today?
"It's interesting, you get a lot more interviews when things are bad than when things are getting better. So this is certainly quite a change," Cook says of our conversation.
In the late '90s, scientists say fishermen were pulling about 60 percent of the cod out of the water each year in the North Sea. It doesn't take an advanced math degree to calculate that that is unsustainable.
So about 10 years ago, the government bought about half of the fishing boats in Scotland and destroyed them. The boats that kept working were put under strict regulations  the number of days they could spend at sea, the number of cod they could catch.
And to Cook, it looks like the program is working. "I certainly in the past would've avoided buying cod, whereas I wouldn't now," he says.

It's not a perfect system.
Fishermen tell me they sometimes throw dead cod back in the water when they scoop them up with other fish. Otherwise, they'll be penalized for violating quotas.
In Fraserburgh, Mutch tells me he thinks this community can regulate itself. I note that some critics say that, if the industry is allowed to self-regulate, then every ship will be in a race to empty out the oceans. What does he think?
"I would've said 20 years ago, 15 years ago, possibly. But you've now got a breed of young fishermen who have gone through all the trauma that we've gone through. They realize that we can't do what we were doing before."
He says the new crop of fishermen has seen what their parents went through and realize they can't return to the old ways. And there is a new generation coming on board.
Xander West gave up fishing almost 20 years ago when the fishery started collapsing. But his son, he says, has now taken up trawling.
He says his son doesn't make a great living, but it's good enough. And he's just glad that his son can continue in the family business.

        <MainBody>Foreign Policy Experts Weigh In On U.S. Strategy Against The Islamic State
May 28, 2015 5:23 PM ET
NPR's Robert Siegel speaks with White House spokesman Josh Earnest about the current U.S. strategy in Iraq and Syria. He also interviews foreign policy experts who say that policy needs review.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
A U.S. official put the dilemma posed by the self-proclaimed Islamic State this way - we have never seen a terrorist organization with 22,000 foreign fighters from a hundred countries. That, the official noted, is double the number who went to fight against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan over a 10-year period back in the 1980s. ISIS, or as the U.S. government calls it, ISIL, controls territory in two neighboring countries - Iraq and Syria. It is an extremist Sunni Muslim group in a region racked by sectarian tensions. Many Sunni Muslims are alarmed by the rise of Shiite groups across the region supported by Shiite Iran. For some, ISIS is an alternative. Is it time to rethink U.S. policy in the region? In a moment, we're going to hear from some people who think it is. First, what is U.S. policy? A cornerstone remains President Obama's assurance of what Washington will not do. This is from a speech in September.
(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)
BARACK OBAMA: I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.
SIEGEL: For more on U.S. policy with respect to ISIS, we turn now to White House spokesman, Josh Earnest.
Welcome to the program.
JOSH EARNEST: Hi Robert.
SIEGEL: Is it fair to say that, like it or not, ISIS is going to be around for a few years in some parts of Iraq and or Syria?
EARNEST: Well, I think the president has made it clear that our efforts to try to counter ISIL are not a short-term proposition, that our strategy is predicated on supporting the Iraqi government, the Iraqi people and the Iraqi security forces in doing what we're not going to be in a position to do for them.
SIEGEL: I just want to ask you about this figure of three years that has been mentioned by the president as a rough time span. What do you say to people who say, you know, the U.S. won the war in the Pacific in about that much time, we've seen wars in the Middle East that Israel has won in weeks if not days. Why should it take three years to defeat this one group?
EARNEST: Well, because this is a very different kind of conflict. And in this instance, we're counting on the Iraqi people, the Iraqi government and the Iraqi security forces taking the fight on the ground against ISIL inside their own country. That's the responsibility of that government and of that people. And the United States and our coalition partners are all going to stand with the Iraqi central government as they take on this daunting task.
SIEGEL: And just to be clear, to those who say another 25 or 30,000 U.S. troops might indeed prove decisive in the conflict against ISIS, the Obama White House would say?
EARNEST: We are unwilling to dedicate that kind of blood and treasure to Iraq again. We saw what the result of that previous investment was. And that is not discounting the bravery and courage of our men and women in uniform - they had a substantial impact on the security situation there. But the Iraqi people, and because of the failed leadership of Prime Minister Maliki, was not able to capitalize on it.
So our strategy right now is predicated on building-up the capacity of those local forces and giving them another opportunity to control the security situation inside their own country and to do so with the support of the United States and our coalition partners. But we're not going to be able to do it for them.
SIEGEL: How would you sum-up U.S. interests in Iraq and Syria?
EARNEST: Well, I think the U.S. interest in that region of the world is to make sure that extremists like those in ISIL are not able to establish a safe haven there. The president is determined to make sure that we are building-up the capacity of local fighters, both in Syria and Iraq, to make sure that ISIL cannot establish a safe haven inside of Iraq and Syria that they can then use to carry out and encourage acts of violence throughout the region and across the world.
SIEGEL: White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, thanks a lot for talking with us.
EARNEST: Nice to visit with you, Robert.
SIEGEL: Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations takes the opposite view of dispatching additional U.S. troops to the region. He says there should be more U.S. forces in Iraq and they should do more.
MAX BOOT: I think, clearly, we need to have looser rules of engagement that would allow our personnel to go out there with the Iraqis to buttress their professionalism and to call-in air strikes as necessary. To do that, I think we would need to have a larger force package, probably on the order of 10 to 20,000 personnel rather than at 3,000 that we have there now.
SIEGEL: Do you think there's a realistic approach, at least in Iraq, by which an Iraqi government can both push ISIS out but also draw Sunni Arabs in and be an attractive alternative to extreme Islamism in that region?
BOOT: Well, in fact, those two goals have to go together because unless the government can attract the support of Sunnis in Iraq, it will never defeat ISIS. It just won't happen. Relying on Shiite sectarian militias directed and armed by Iran is not the answer because the more that those sectarian forces are at the forefront of the anti-ISIS battle, the more that Sunnis will decide that ISIS is the preferable alternative.
SIEGEL: Max Boot, can you just describe, as you understand it, what is the U.S. interest in that part of the world? That is, why are Americans even discussing how many troops we should be sending back into Iraq or whom we should be supporting in the region? What's in it for us?
BOOT: I mean, we saw what would happen on - what in fact happened in 2001, when extremists took over in Afghanistan and from there we saw a plot being directed that wound-up in the most costly attack ever on American soil. And that's from a country - Afghanistan - which is relatively inconsequential compared to a country like Iraq, which has some of the largest oil reserves in the world.
SIEGEL: Oil and terrorism is what you're saying.
BOOT: A combination of oil and terrorism, it's a deadly brew. And then you throw in the possibility of weapons of mass destruction, and it's a truly toxic mix that we ought to be very concerned about.
SIEGEL: Max Boot, thank you very much for talking with us today.
BOOT: Thanks for having me on.
WALTER RUSSELL MEAD: Given the successes of ISIS and the general mess in the region, it's definitely high time for a rethink.
SIEGEL: Walter Russell Mead is a professor of foreign policy at Bard College and a distinguished scholar at the Hudson Institute. A lot of what's happening in the region and driving Sunni Muslims to ISIS, he says, is the U.S. nuclear negotiations with Iran.
MEAD: Well, I think they have a good idea, which is that trying to change the U.S.-Iranian relationship could mean a more stable Middle East. But the way they've gone about it has actually meant that that policy has helped to destabilize the Middle East. That in order to reassure the Sunnis and others that the U.S. isn't tilting toward Iran in a way that sets up Iran as a kind of hegemonic regional power, the U.S. needs to do a lot more to balance Iranian influence around the region. And I think probably Syria is the centerpiece for that effort.
SIEGEL: How could the U.S. allay those Sunni Arab fears of a resurgent Iran in Syria?
MEAD: Well, you look at what we're doing now, is in Ramadi, we're working with Shia Iraqi forces to defeat ISIS, and in Syria, we are bombing ISIS, but rather conspicuously not bombing the Assad forces, which are supported by Iran. So to a lot of Sunni observers in a region, it looks like a very, very heavy-handed intervention for the Shia against the Sunni. I think what we probably need to do is make the removal of Assad the first priority in Syria, and that creates a climate in which we and others will be able to deal with ISIS.
SIEGEL: It wouldn't create a vacuum that ISIS could walk right into in Syria and take over?
MEAD: Well, in a sense, the status quo of a civil war in Syria has created the vacuum into which ISIS has stepped, so we're already there. But I think as long as the Sunni world thinks that we're actually trying to prop-up Assad and support Iran, then what we're going to see is a continuing radicalization not only of people on the streets - some sort of crazy teenagers - but of actually more serious, and in some cases policymaking officials, in government.
SIEGEL: But if you're right, is there any way that the U.S. and other world powers can agree to a nuclear deal with Iran? Lift some sanctions and not aggravate the very fears that the Sunnis have by doing that?
MEAD: Well, I think the fact that we may be about to lift the sanctions and give Iran something like 50 to $150 billion is part of why the Sunni world is so terrified. So I think you have to balance the steps toward Iran with very, very serious efforts to limit Iranian influence in the region.
SIEGEL: Walter Russell Mead of the Hudson Institute and Bard College, thanks for talking with us today.
MEAD: Thanks for having me.
SIEGEL: Now Brian Fishman, who's a counterterrorism research fellow at New America, the Washington-based think tank. He joins us from the studios of Stanford University.
Brian Fishman, is containment living with a less powerful but still-present ISIS? Is that a workable strategy for the U.S.?
BRIAN FISHMAN: Well, not over the long run. Over the long run, ISIS needs to be defeated. I think the challenge is that in the near term, we don't have a lot of good options for rolling the organization back. And that's why I think we really need to be thinking about a long term strategy, not on the period of three years like the administration has discussed, but we're talking about a decade-long effort here. And I think that kind of time frame needs to be squarely in the minds of policymakers and the American people as we think about what's going to be required.
SIEGEL: But imagine for a moment an Iraq that, not just in reality, but in legal fact, breaks apart. Kurdistan is an independent Kurdish country. The Shiite south and east of Iraq is a state closely aligned to Iran. And Anbar Province and the areas that are currently being contested become part of a new Syria where Sunni Muslims feel they're in a comfortable majority. A more stable Middle East than what we have now?
FISHMAN: Not in the short term, but maybe in the long term. And so I think we have this choice in front of us. Are we willing to accept the risks in the short run of redefining these lines in the hopes - potentially in the vain hopes - that we can define more stable lines in the future? Or are we going to try to defend the lines that are there now, which we know are unstable? And it's a sort of devil you know or devil, you know, don't know because right now, I don't think - I think the core problem we have is we don't know what we're fighting for. We don't know what the policy is that we're fighting for. We know that we need to go after ISIS. We know we want to defeat them. But what is it that comes after that? What does Syria look like after that? And that to me is still unclear.
SIEGEL: Brian Fishman of New America, thanks for talking with us.
FISHMAN: Thank you.
SIEGEL: We also heard from Walter Russell Mead of Bard College and the Hudson Institute, Max Boot of the Council on Foreign Relations and from White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.

Chinese writers and publishers are being celebrated this week in New York at BookExpo America  the industry's largest trade event in North America. Organizers of the event say China deserves a seat at the table because it is such a big and potentially lucrative market. But some authors and free speech advocates have seen this as an opportunity to shine light on censorship in China.
Most of the books in the exhibition area are in Chinese, but Paul Myatovich presides over a display of books in translation. Myatovich is sales and marketing manager for CN Times Books, which is the U.S. publishing arm of Beijing Media Times. He says being invited to BookExpo is a great opportunity for Chinese publishers:
"To give Americans and Westerners who are coming to the show a chance to see the breadth of Chinese publishing  that it's not all the little red book of Mao," Myatovich says.
BookExpo invited China to exhibit this year because organizers say China represents a market that could be crucial to Western publishers. But critics say in its eagerness to please the Chinese, the book industry is ignoring the dark side of publishing in China: censorship. Xiaolu Guo is a Chinese writer who now lives in the U.K. She left China because she felt she had to censor herself to stay out of trouble.
"You have to protect yourself," she says. "... If you can't leave China, most of the writers, artists and filmmakers they have to play the game. You know  use lots of metaphors to write a story or don't touch certain subjects."
Western writers who publish in China are also subject to censorship and sometimes they don't even know how their work has been altered. In his novel Sunset Park, Paul Auster included a mention of the imprisoned Chinese poet Liu Xiaobo. His Chinese publisher indicated some changes might be necessary but Auster says it wasn't until he got a copy of the Chinese translation of his book that he understood that all mention of the dissident poet had been eliminated.
Auster and Xiaolu Guo were in Manhattan on Wednesday to take part in a protest organized by the PEN American Center on the steps of the New York Public Library. They were joined by both Chinese and American writers including Jonathan Franzen, Ha Jin, Francine Prose and A.M. Homes, who all read from the work of dissident Chinese writers. Auster read a poem by Liu Xiaobo.
Yes, it's vibrant, yes it dynamic, yes there are some great Chinese writers who can get published and whose books can be sold. But there are also others who are completely muzzled and jailed and that piece of the story at least seems to be missing.
- Suzanne Nozzel, executive director of PEN American Center
China may deserve a seat at the international publishing table, but PEN American Executive Director Suzanne Nossel says that doesn't mean the rest of the world should overlook the fact that there are two very different sides to Chinese publishing.
"Yes, it's vibrant, yes it dynamic, yes there are some great Chinese writers who can get published and whose books can be sold. But there are also others who are completely muzzled and jailed and that piece of the story at least seems to be missing, so we think it's important to show the part of the story that is not being told."
As the protest ended, Nossel led the demonstrators in signing a petition demanding freedom for imprisoned Chinese writers.

        <MainBody>What Are $26 Million In American Express Rewards Points Worth?
May 28, 2015 4:47 PM ET
While he was a FIFA executive, Chuck Blazer charged $26 million in business expenses to a personal American Express card. Brian Kelly of thepointsguy.com explains the value of those rewards points.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
The Justice Department's investigation into FIFA was aided in part by an American informant named Chuck Blazer. He was on FIFA's executive board until 2013 - that's when he pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering and money laundering also tied to soccer. And CONCACAF, the group we mentioned earlier that runs soccer in the Caribbean and the Americas, had its own questions about how he did business. The organization revealed that he had charged business expenses to his personal American Express card. Not a dinner or two out, but $26 million worth of expenses.
BRIAN KELLY: My first reaction is, wow, I'm pretty impressed. This guy's savvy. You know, 26 million AmEx membership rewards points are really valuable.
SIEGEL: The thought that Brian Kelly had there is one of the actual explanations for why Chuck Blazer may have done this - he wanted the American Express reward points. We couldn't resist calling Kelly. He's the founder of thepointsguy.com, a website that advises on how to maximize your points for travel, and we asked him what Blazer could've done with $26 million worth of points.
KELLY: Something tells me he's probably a first-class traveler, so he'd be able to get 208 round-trip, first-class flights to Europe. And at 9,000 bucks a ticket, that's over $1.8 million in value.
SIEGEL: Not too shabby. And while this amount is over the top, Kelly says that for a lot of companies, this practice is business as usual.
KELLY: A prime example of a business that rakes-in points - I know several high-end travel agents that book all the travel for their clients, and then they get paid by check. So they spend hundreds of thousands a years on safaris and flights, and they earn all the points personally.
SIEGEL: If you're racking-up the points and are more of a homebody millionaire, there are other options. Consider this offer on AmEx's website - a 56-foot, above-ground metal storm shelter for only 13 million points.

        <MainBody>NPR's Robert Siegel speaks with Randolph Harris, president of the Barbados Football Association, about the latest on the FIFA indictments and the soccer organization's upcoming presidential vote.
ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:
The head of soccer's governing organization made clear today that he plans on sticking around. Sepp Blatter spoke at opening ceremony of FIFA's annual congress a day after seven of its officials were arrested on corruption charges and a day before he stands for reelection. Blatter first won the presidency in 1998. He told the FIFA congress today, he could not monitor everyone all the time.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SEPP BLATTER: But it must fall to me to bear the responsibility for the reputation and well-being of our organization and to find a way forward to fix things.
SIEGEL: Well, now we're going to hear from one of the people who will cast a vote on whether Sepp Blatter deserves another term as president of FIFA. Joining us from Zurich is the president of the Barbados Football Association, Randolph Harris. Mr. Harris, welcome to the program.
RANDOLPH HARRIS: Thank you, and thanks for having me.
SIEGEL: Tell us, first, your reaction to the U.S. indictment that was unsealed yesterday.
HARRIS: Well, obviously, I could only describe it as a devastating blow. We were shocked by the developments.
SIEGEL: You say you were shocked. There have been any number of journalistic investigations, reports of corruption within FIFA. How can one be shocked at this point?
HARRIS: We are shocked because of the persons who were arrested yesterday and because we had no inkling that they were involved in anything untoward as far as the football is concerned.
SIEGEL: Does all of that untoward behavior - does it reflect Sepp Blatter, and would you say, based on these indictments, Mr. Blatter should be thanked for his service and retired from the presidency?
HARRIS: Well, I don't know if I agree with that kind of reasoning. The thing about it is, Mr. Blatter is the head of FIFA, which is a worldwide organization. The persons who were indicted by the United States authorities yesterday are part of one confederation which Mr. Blatter does not oversee on a day-to-day basis.
SIEGEL: That's the confederation that you're a member of, representing Barbados.
HARRIS: Of course.
SIEGEL: There are big corporations that sponsor FIFA tournaments, including the World Cup, that are very concerned about what's happened. How much do the opinions of Visa or McDonald's count as you think about the future of FIFA and its leadership?
HARRIS: Those sponsors are very, very important to the game. And as you know, we have some of those sponsors operating in our small countries. And it is important to us that these sponsors think that they are doing well for the countries and that their names are being held in high esteem.
SIEGEL: Will it influence your vote on the presidency?
HARRIS: At the moment, I have not really made up my mind completely, but I am voting in the best interest of the game. My integrity is the only thing that I have going for me, and I think I'm going to vote for transparency and, of course, for development of the future.
SIEGEL: But considering that the indictment yesterday cited not only misbehavior by a little more than a dozen individuals but also a culture of corruption over the past 20 years, how can you be in favor of transparency and still be in favor of continuing the same regime of leadership at FIFA?
HARRIS: Well, I have not confirmed that I am continuing the same regime of FIFA. I will make that decision tomorrow when I have discussions with some of my member states. But the point about it is - and this is very important - that in all of this, President Blatter has not been named as an accomplice.
SIEGEL: Would you say that there are other heads of national football associations whom you've been speaking with who share your doubts at this moment and are trying to figure out what to do?
HARRIS: Yes. I believe I can say, on the record now, that when we came here on Monday, we were all going to vote on block for President Blatter. I think that was a decision that we made at the Concacaf meeting which was held two months ago in the Bahamas.
SIEGEL: Concacaf being the Western Hemisphere Football Association - Federation.
HARRIS: Yes, yes. But since the development yesterday, it has brought a cloud on to that decision that we made prior to hearing the news. That really devastated us yesterday.
SIEGEL: Well, Mr. Harris, thank you very much for talking with us as you prepare to make that decision.
HARRIS: I thank you for having me, and I'm very grateful.
SIEGEL: That's Randolph Harris who is the president of the Barbados Football Association. He'll be one of the members voting on the presidency of FIFA tomorrow in Switzerland.

Reforming the education system in any country can be tricky. But in France, where learning is highly centralized and public school (l'ecole de la Republique) a symbol of French greatness, it's all but impossible.
Several French presidents have tried and failed. President Francois Hollande's second attempt has traditionalists up in arms and critics on the right and left screaming that French schools are being dumbed down.
Teachers, students and some parents took to the streets of cities across the country recently to denounce the government's project.
One of the most contentious elements is the plan to cut back on Greek and Latin, focusing instead on teaching a more lively history of ancient civilizations. In Paris, Latin and Greek teachers waved signs of protest as they marched through the streets, some of them dressed in togas.
Former journalist Peter Gumbel, who is writing his second book on the French education system, says the middle school reform has touched a nerve.
"The fuss has come about because there are certain very elitist things that are being scratched at," he says. "Anyone who thinks of himself as an intellectual is saying, this is the end of civilization as we know it! But of course it's not."
Conservatives are also up in arms about proposed changes to teaching history. Slavery and colonialism are to be emphasized, while the study of the Enlightenment will be optional.
Luc Ferry, education minister under former President Jacques Chirac, denounced what he called an "apologist curriculum."
"Presenting European civilization through the lens of the slave trade and colonialism is scandalous," said Ferry. "What about Voltaire and Diderot, not to mention the invention of science, the encyclopedia and the museum, and of course the ideals of the French revolution  these aren't important?"
The aim of the reform is to make the heavy, French middle school curriculum more interesting and lively for students. International studies show France has one of the highest dropout rates, with one in five kids leaving school with no qualifications at all.
Author Gumbel says the French public school system is also one of the world's most unequal, with success often linked to where a student lives and the income level of his family.
"And for a country where the words liberte, fraternite and egalite are carved on the front of school buildings, that's very shocking for the French," says Gumbel.
"They have this meritocratic belief in the vision that anybody by sheer dint of their intellectual prowess can rise to the top of French society," he continues." And of course it basically doesn't work like that. And the real problem is it's getting worse."
At the protest, 65-year-old Odile Nicolas says she's demonstrating for her granddaughter, who will start middle school next year.
"Dumbing down school is not the way to go," she says. "Children from disadvantaged families should be pulled up to succeed in their lives and not the other way around."

A new smartphone app gives a close-up view of a patient's eye.
Screengrab from video by Peek Vision, produced in collaboration with Sony Mobile.
The creators of a new smart phone app say that portable testing will help prevent blindness in the developing world.
British ophthalmologist Andrew Bastawrous moved his family from London to Kenya in 2013 with $150,000 of equipment, a team of 15 people and an ambitious goal: to understand the causes of blindness in rural Africa. It didn't take long before he encountered all sorts of obstacles, including unpredictable power supplies and the regular need to run a gas-fueled generator to keep the equipment going. Many of the villages he was trying to reach had no roads and no electricity.
There had to be a better way, Bastawrous thought as he set about developing a smartphone app to help conduct high-quality eye exams without the need for heavy or expensive equipment. In the first published study on the app, called Peek , he and colleagues report that, for a group of older Kenyans, the phone-based vision test worked just as well as the gold-standard methods used in a doctor's office.
Of the 285 million people in the world with vision impairment, 80 percent live in low-income countries. The vast majority have preventable or treatable conditions, like glaucoma or cataracts. By increasing access to simple and affordable eye tests, Bastawrous hopes to create awareness about eye conditions and, in turn, connect patients with vision-saving treatments.
People In Poor Communities Are More Likely To Lose Eyesight
"For most people, it's an accepted consequence of old age that as you get older, you lose your sight," he says. "If we can create a freely downloadable app with high-quality results, it means that hopefully more people with vision problems can be identified, particularly the most vulnerable groups."
There are two standard ways to test vision. One is with a traditional letter chart that shows progressively smaller letters as patients read down each line. A newer, more accurate method uses an electronically powered box that illuminates letters of various sizes.
The Peek vision test looks a little different. On the phone's screen, patients see just one letter: an "E" that can be displayed with the prongs facing up, down, to the left or to the right. Patients don't need to be able to read or to know the English alphabet. They just point a finger in the direction they see the E facing. If it looks like a "W," for example, when pointing up.
The test-giver, who does not need to be a trained health care worker, stands 6 feet away and simply swipes the phone to indicate the way the patient thinks the E is positioned. If the patient shakes his head because the letter is too blurry, the test-giver shakes the phone. That's the "don't know" response.
At the end of the test, which takes a little over a minute, the phone vibrates and dings. Results appear immediately on the screen and can be translated to the 20/20 scale. The app can also show the patient's level of blurriness compared to normal vision.
For the latest trial, Bastawrous' team evaluated 233 Kenyans who were 55 or older. At home, patients took two eye exams: one with the Peek app and one with a standard paper chart. The next day, the same people went to a temporary clinic, where they completed the same two tests as well as one with the newer electronic technology.
Results, which appeared Thursday in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology , showed that the Peek test was as accurate as the other two methods for testing vision. The app's test, Bastawrous adds, was as quick if not quicker than the paper chart.
The phone method has other advantages, he says, including more objectivity. While paper charts require an examiner to look frequently back and forth from the patient to the chart to check for accuracy, a test-giver holding a phone never has to make any assessments at all. The phone does all the work. And once the results are on a smartphone, they can be shared remotely with doctors who are not in the field. The app also performs retina scans and other kinds of vision tests that are undergoing their own trials.
In a follow-up study that has not yet been published, the team found that people were very accepting of phone-based vision tests, possibly because the technology is so familiar. In sub-Saharan Africa, according to the United Nations, more people have cellphones than have clean, running water.
A portable, easy-to-use vision app could be useful in settings where ophthalmologists might be scarce, like developing countries, or even for patients who want to monitor their eyesight at home, says Jeremy Keenan, an ocular infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco.
"This could greatly expand the ability of public health agencies to include vision screening in their outreach programs," Keenan says. "The hope would be that this type of tool could help identify people with eye disease before they have lost too much vision and at a time when treatments are still available, though whether this will be the case needs to be studied further."
One important step that needs to be worked out: how to translate vision test results into action.
"No matter how good the technology is, it's just a test," Bastawrous says. "You have to link people to very dedicated health workers and good quality services."

Photographer Gabriel Garcia Roman's portraits feature friends and acquaintances, activists and poets, Americans and immigrants  some naturalized, some undocumented.
All of them are queer people of color.
"I wanted to specifically focus on this community because queer and trans people of color are so rarely represented in the art world," says Roman , who is Mexican-American and also identifies as queer.

The photo series, called " Queer Icons ," evokes the colorful, religious artwork that Roman grew up with. "Because I grew up Catholic in a Mexican community in Chicago, my first introduction to art was religious art," he says.
He was particularly inspired by the fresco paintings of haloed saints that decorated the walls of his neighborhood church. "I've always thought of the halo as something very powerful  it's like a badge of nobility," he says.
And because Roman's subjects are activists and artists who do good for the community, "I wanted to represent them as saints," he says.
He also wanted to capture their pride and their strength. "I wanted them to be warriors  that's why a lot of them are looking straight at the camera, saying 'Here I am, and I'm not going to hide.'"
Some of the images feature poems or prose, written by the subject of the portraits. Roman uses the silkscreen printing method to layer text and photograph with color and pattern.
He has shown this work at several exhibits around the country. As of now, he works on the project in his free time  he works at a market research firm by day.
Like many of the people he has photographed, Roman, 41, says he often grapples with his identity. He moved with his family from Zacatecas, Mexico to the US when he was two years old, and they were undocumented until he was 15. "I grew up in the states always being reminded that I was Mexican," he says. "When I finally went to Mexico for the first time, when I was 31, everyone there was like 'You're not Mexican  you're American.'"
These images play with feelings of not belonging, and, above all, being seen.

FABRICE COFFRINI/AFP/Getty Images
One day after a string of bribery arrests and indictments was revealed to center on FIFA, the soccer organization's president, Sepp Blatter, says he will not resign. Accusations of rampant corruption at FIFA emerged just two days before Blatter is set to stand for re-election.
The dozens of criminal charges unveiled Wednesday have stoked long-simmering suspicions about corruption in soccer's governing body. On Thursday, the leader of Europe's umbrella soccer organization, UEFA, said many of its member associations will support the lone challenger to Blatter in Friday's election, Jordan's Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein.
"Enough is enough," UEFA President Michel Platini said. He added, "I am disgusted."
UEFA's announcement came after its call to postpone the vote was rebuffed.
Speaking about Blatter, Platini said at a news conference Thursday that "he already lost. FIFA already lost."
When he was later asked whether UEFA would consider withdrawing from FIFA, Platini said, "Of course."
Update at 12 p.m. ET: Blatter Speaks At FIFA Congress
As FIFA's international sessions begin in Zurich with an opening ceremony Thursday, Blatter tells the audience that corrupt actions "bring shame and humiliation on football and demand action and change from us all."
He also said he can't be expected to know what every FIFA official is up to. Read more from Blatter in our separate post .
Our original story continues:
Platini said that when he asked Blatter to step down, the FIFA leader answered that it's now too late  but that he might have agreed to resign had he been asked earlier.
Blatter was "affected" by their talk, said Platini, who added that he had spoken to Blatter as an old friend.
It's a startling turnabout for both Blatter and FIFA, which earlier this year announced that from 2011 to 2014, it brought in revenue of $5.7 billion against expenses of $5.38 billion. Television rights represent 43 percent of that total; marketing, 29 percent.
On Wednesday, U.S. and Swiss authorities announced arrests, indictments and investigations into alleged bribery and kickbacks, with the U.S. inquiry naming nine senior FIFA officials and several sports marketing executives. A separate Swiss investigation includes the process of choosing host cities for two upcoming World Cup tournaments, in Russia and Qatar.
Seven FIFA officials were arrested at a Lake Zurich hotel where FIFA members had gathered ahead of the organization's elections. Later, the U.S. released a lengthy indictment against 14 individuals that detailed money changing hands over marketing and media rights to prestigious tournaments run by FIFA.
The criminal charges, mostly against senior FIFA leaders in the U.S. and South America, have had wide effects, prompting federal police in Brazil to raid a sports marketing firm in Rio de Janeiro.
From Rio, NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro reports:
"It's called Klefer Sports Marketing and it's owned by the former head of renowned Brazilian soccer club Flamengo. The company negotiates TV rights for sporting events and had a close relationship with Traffic, the Brazilian firm implicated in bribery scheme.
"Separately, the former footballer and current senator known simply here as Romario has asked the Senate to open an investigation into the Brazilian football confederation. The former president and current vice president of the Brazilian confederation, Jose Maria Marin, is under indictment by U.S. authorities for his involvement in the alleged massive kickback scheme."

The Department of Defense says an attempt to ship inactive anthrax samples resulted in live samples being sent to labs in nine U.S. states and to a U.S. Air Force base in South Korea.
Fears of exposure to the potentially deadly disease prompted officials to advise four civilian workers to get preventive care; more than 20 military personnel are also being monitored. The samples were sent via commercial shipping companies, but the Pentagon says there is "no known risk to the general public."
The spores were supposed to have been killed by being irradiated. But at least one lab, in Maryland, reported receiving spores that were still alive. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating the accidental shipment.
From NPR's Science Desk, Geoff Brumfiel reports:
"The anthrax came from the Army's Dugway Proving Ground in Utah, which conducts biosecurity research. The samples were apparently sent to labs in nine states as part of ongoing efforts to develop field tests for anthrax.
"Tests are usually conducted with dead samples of anthrax, and an investigation is now under way to learn why live samples were sent instead. Anthrax are highly infectious bacteria that can travel through the air and infect people.
"So far, the Pentagon says it appears nobody has become sick from the mistake. It has suspended all shipments of biological agents from its labs until an investigation is completed."
The military says 22 personnel were potentially exposed to the live sample at a U.S. base in South Korea.
From Seoul, NPR's Elise Hu reports:
"The military destroyed the anthrax on Wednesday after the sample, which was thought to be inactive, was suspected of being live. None of the personnel in contact showed signs of exposure. But they were given exams, antibiotics, and in some cases, vaccinations.
"The military stresses there was no risk to the public. The exposure happened in a contained lab environment on the Osan Air Base, which is 65 miles south of Seoul. It's one of a number of bases that houses the estimated 28,000 American military personnel based in South Korea."
According to the CDC's fact page on anthrax, it's caused by "rod-shaped bacteria known as Bacillus anthracis," is found naturally in soil, and affects domestic and wild animals around the world.
Anthrax can cause severe illness, the CDC says  the agency adds that while the disease can spread through spores, "anthrax is not contagious, which means you can't catch it like the cold or flu."

Most of the charges relate to bribes paid by sports marketing executives to secure lucrative marketing and media rights. One of the companies named has its North American headquarters in Miami.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
And there are other companies with a lot on their minds right now - FIFA's big sponsors, which tie their brands to the sport and its organizers. With more on the potential fallout they face, here's NPR's Jason Margolis.
JASON MARGOLIS, BYLINE: Coca-Cola, Adidas, Visa and Hyundai are FIFA's main long-term sponsors. They're not saying much about yesterday's corruption charges. None agreed to an interview. Visa did release a brief statement expressing disappointment in FIFA. The company said it will, quote, "reassess our sponsorship" if FIFA doesn't take immediate steps to address issues within its organization. An Adidas spokesperson sent a brief email saying Adidas is committed to creating a culture that promotes the highest standards of ethics and compliance, and we expect the same from our partners. They wouldn't comment further.
MIKE LEWIS: I actually think it's probably enough in this day and age - I mean, the expression of concern that they're monitoring the situation.
MARGOLIS: Mike Lewis specializes in sports marketing at Emory University. He says sponsors need to emphasize that they're supporting the game itself.
LEWIS: And so I think for the vast majority of fans, you know, Coca-Cola is connected to the stars on the field, not the administrators in the back office.
MARGOLIS: Political scientist Andrei Markovits takes things a step further. He teaches a class about sports, politics and society at the University of Michigan.
ANDREI MARKOVITS: If FIFA were run by child molesters, mass murderers and - I don't know - some other heinous folks, it would have zero effect on my soccer watching - zero - and I'm not the exception.
MARGOLIS: He says Coke and Adidas know what fans are like, and they know what FIFA is like, too.
MARKOVITS: Everyone knows these organizations are crooked. This is known. This is how you procure votes. This is totally not news.
MARGOLIS: Still, there is some pressure on sponsors to disassociate from FIFA. Activists are calling on them to challenge FIFA's decision to hold the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and are sharply critical of alleged human rights abuses at construction sites in that country. Hundreds of guest workers have died there in the past five years. Three sponsors did walk away from the FIFA earlier this year - Johnson &amp; Johnson, Castrol and Continental Tires. I contacted all three. They sent brief emails basically saying it was a business decision. Andrei Markovits says sponsors like Coke will distance themselves from FIFA soccer when fans distance themselves.
MARKOVITS: If in fact Coke actually realizes that, boy, this is bad enough and we're really worried that somehow people will not watch the World Cup then yes, but...
MARGOLIS: No way that's happening. More than 900 million people watched the World Cup final. That's nearly eight times as many as the Super Bowl. Jason Margolis, NPR News.
