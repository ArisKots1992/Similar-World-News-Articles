A week after its second grand opening, Club 469 on Naples posh Fifth Avenue South closed its doors and the owner is selling the bar at a hefty loss.
It was a brief life for an upscale bar that gained notoriety after a Craigslist ad seeking go-go dancers led to a tip that prompted Naples Code Enforcement officials to shut it down last month, four weeks after its April 2 opening. The owner, who moved here from Italy, wasnt aware city code required alcohol to be served with food, and the bar manager was unaware go-go dancers arent allowed without City Council approval  which wasnt likely.
However, after lining up a food vendor, removing the front window curtains and proving he did have the required licenses when he first opened, owner Tommaso Davide reopened on May 15-16.
It opened for that weekend, and has been closed ever since, Code Enforcement Manager Roger Jacobsen said of the second grand opening at 469 Fifth Ave. S.
Landlord Phil McCabe said hed heard rumors the business had closed but he hadnt heard from Davide, who is on a month-to-month lease, with rent due June 1.
He was the bars third owner in less than a year.
On Thursday, Davide was packing up, taking fixtures off the walls, selling the furniture, beers and pricey wines. He said he lost his entire investment and would have to sell it at a loss.
I was screwed, Davide said Thursday, adding that he reviewed the financial records before buying, but the numbers were inflated. He sold me this place for $250,000, when he knew it was only worth $80,000. I came here to Naples to invest my money on a future for my family and what happened? The first person I met an Italian  screwed me and I lost all my money.
Davides broker, whom he declined to name, told him the bars value, but doubted it would sell for that, Davide said, adding that the broker found a buyer, so he hopes to sell within days.
Davide operated an advertising display business with his father in Milan, Italy, and bought the upscale, contemporary bar from Moreno Circi, who incorporated and obtained licenses under the name Ifood LLC, but never opened. Moreno purchased the former Osetra Caviar and Champagne Bar last August from Milos Simovic, who opened it with Anthony Chinaglia in August 2011.
Circi could not be reached for comment and Davide said Circi had disconnected his phone and those of his wife and children, so he also couldnt reach him. .
Although Naples city officials said Davide didnt have a city business tax receipt  which must be filed before a business opens  it turned out he did have one, but it was under the bars prior name. He also had state alcohol and food service licenses.
Im a nice, normal person with a wife and two children, Davide said. I had a dream. I was investing my money in Florida. Naples seemed like a nice city, with nice people. ... Im hard, Im tough, I dont want to give up. I want to build a life here.
Hes looking for a new business investment  but it wont involve restaurants or bars, Davide said, adding, This has been the worst four months of my life.

OXON HILL, Md. - They couldn't be rattled. They couldn't be denied. Gokul Venkatachalam and Vanya Shivashankar had worked too hard and come close too many times not to win the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday.
So they shared the title, making history in two different ways.
The bee hadn't ended in a tie for 52 years  until last year. Now it's happened for an unprecedented two years running.
Vanya, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, is the first sibling of a past champion to win. Her sister, Kavya, won in 2009.
Vanya's final word was "scherenschnitte," which means the art of cutting paper into decorative designs. After being informed he'd be the co-champion if he got the next word right, Gokul didn't even bother to ask the definition before spelling "nunatak." For the record, it means a hill or mountain completely surrounded by glacial ice.
Asked what he thought when he got the word, Gokul said, "Me and Vanya were going to be the champions."

Gokul, 14, of Chesterfield, Missouri, finished third last year, behind the two co-champions. He had a gruff on-stage demeanor, asking about the word's roots and definition before chugging through the letters as if he had dinner plans.
"I wasn't nervous," said Gokul, a LeBron James fan who said his priority for after the bee was watching the NBA Finals.
Both are eighth-graders, so it was their last chance. Vanya was competing in the bee for the fifth and final time. Her sister, Kavya  now a sophomore at Columbia University  competed four times, which means the Shivashankar family has made the trip nine of the past 10 years.
Vanya, who also acts and plays the tuba and piano, dedicated her victory to her grandmother.

"Everything takes hard work and passion," Vanya said. "That's definitely what I put in and I know Gokul put that into this endeavor as well."
Proving their superiority over even their toughest competitors, Vanya and Gokul went head-to-head for 10 rounds before the list of 25 championship words was exhausted.
The words included: bouquetire, caudillismo, thamakau, scytale, Bruxellois and pyrrhuloxia. Vanya appeared to struggle only with the Fijian-derived thamaku, which is a type of outrigger canoe.
Fourteen-year-old Cole Shafer-Ray of Norman, Oklahoma, making his first appearance in the finals, finished third.
Fourteen of the past 18 winners, including the four champions the past two years, have been Indian-Americans.

EAST NAPLES, Fla. - Collier County sheriff's deputies are looking for a man who robbed an East Naples Domino's Pizza at gunpoint Wednesday night.
Employees at the store at 5494 Rattlesnake Hammock Road called 911 around 11:40 p.m. Wednesday, saying they had been robbed. The store's manager told deputies the suspect ordered him and two other employees to the front of the store to open the register.
Before leaving, the man made the employees go to the back of the restaurant. He left through the front of the door with an undisclosed amount of cash.
The employees described the suspect as wearing a black hoodie, black pants, black gloves and a black bandana across his face. No one was injured during the robbery.

CHICAGO - Former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert agreed to pay $3.5 million in hush money to keep an unidentified person silent about "prior misconduct" by the Illinois Republican who was once third in line to the U.S. presidency, according to a federal grand jury indictment handed down on Thursday in Chicago.
The indictment, which does not describe the misconduct Hastert was allegedly trying to conceal, charges the 73-year-old with one count of evading bank regulations as he withdrew tens of thousands of dollars at a time to make the payments. He is also charged with one count of lying to the FBI about the reason for the unusual bank withdrawals.
Each count of the indictment carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
The Associated Press left a phone message seeking comment with a person at Hastert's Washington, D.C., office. It was not immediately returned. Hastert did not immediately return a message left on his cellphone seeking comment, or respond to an email.
Hastert withdrew a total of around $1.7 million in cash from various bank accounts from 2010 to 2014, and then provided it to the person identified in the indictment only as Individual A. Hastert allegedly agreed to pay the person $3.5 million, but never apparently paid that full amount.
The indictment notes Hastert was a high school teacher and coach from 1965 to 1981 in suburban Yorkville, about 50 miles west of Chicago. While the indictment says Individual A has been a resident of Yorkville and has known Hastert most of his life, it doesn't describe their relationship.
The indictment says Hastert agreed to the payments after multiple meetings in 2010. It says that "during at least one of the meetings, Individual A and defendant discussed past misconduct by defendant against Individual A that had occurred years earlier" and Hastert agreed to pay Individual A $3.5 million "in order to compensate for and conceal his prior misconduct against Individual A," the indictment says.
The indictment says that between 2010 and 2012 Hastert made fifteen $50,000 withdrawals of cash from bank accounts at Old Second Bank, People's State Bank and Castle Bank and gave cash to Individual A around every six weeks.
Around April 2012, bank officials began questioning Hastert about the large withdrawals, and starting in July of that year, Hastert reduced the amounts he withdrew at a time to less than $10,000 apparently so they would not run afoul of a regulation designed to stop illicit activity such as money laundering , according to the indictment.
Among the focuses of the FBI investigation was whether Hastert, in the words of the indictment, was "the victim of a criminal extortion related to, among other matters, his prior positions in government." The court document does not elaborate.
Investigators questioned Hastert on Dec. 8, 2014 and he lied about why he had been withdrawing so much money at a time. He told investigators he did it because he didn't trust the banking system, the indictment alleges.
"Yeah ... I kept the cash. That's what I am doing," it quotes Hastert as saying.
Hastert was a little known lawmaker from suburban Chicago when chosen to succeed conservative Newt Gingrich as speaker. Hastert was picked after favored Louisiana Congressman Bob Livingston resigned following his admission of several sexual affairs.
As speaker, Hastert pushed President George W. Bush's legislative agenda, helping pass a massive tax cut and expanding Medicare prescription drug benefits.
He retired from Congress in 2007 after eight years as speaker, making him the longest-serving Republican House speaker.

Why does the National Spelling Bee matter? Seriously  why does it?
For pronouncer Jacques Bailly, the work that goes into the Spelling Bee taps into his meaning of life. It celebrates the expansion of knowledge and human achievement.
This is a special triumph, its a pinnacle of achievement thats wonderful to see, Bailly said. Its all about the human effort to excel and to show the excellence of knowledge.
Bailly describes himself as a secular humanist with a bit of stoicism. He believes humans have to make their own meaning.
For some people that can be dark, but for me thats liberating, he said.
The accumulation and celebration of knowledge  thats what keeps him coming back since 2003. The Bee itself, to him, is a media event.
This is the big carrot that leads people to try and climb this mountain  but the mountain is what matters, he said. Not the top.
Sometimes he forgets who the winner was, Bailly admits.
The learning and the competition can pay off in so many ways. Studying chemical terms could grease the wheels for a speller to discover a cure for an illness.
Many contestants want to be doctors and scientists, after all.
Were here for a very short time, we know so very little. This is part of going beyond our humble, primate beings, Bailly said. I believe were here to be as good as we can possibly be.

In 1965, the Beatles were still releasing albums, the U.S. was in Vietnam and Michael Kerpan Jr., then 12, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee.
A couple things have changed since then. He last attended the Bee in 1971, when his sister Dori competed.
It was a very different era. The Bee has a lot more visibility than it did at that time, Kerpan said. Im shocked. Its four times as many spellers  huge!
Today, Kerpan, 62, is a social security attorney in Boston. He's attending the Bee for the first time in four decades.
Its very fancy with commercials. We didnt have any of that stuff," he said. "It was just all spelling so it moved faster.
There was also no social media. Do newspaper clips count?

Posted by 1965 National Spelling Bee Competitors on Monday, May 11, 2015
When people misspelled words, they disappeared, he said. It was a very different feeling.
For winning the 1965 Spelling Bee, Kerpansschool in Tulsa got a brand new set of Encyclopedias. He was excused from spelling class for a year with an "A."
The cash prize back then was $1,000, Kerpan said. Thats about $7,500 in 2015 dollars  a far cry from todays combined $38,600 in prizes.
I saved it until graduate school and then it was all gone, he said.
Like most Bee competitors, Kerpan had a bright future after the Bee. He judged at local Tulsa Bee competitions, went to college at Harvard and then University of Chicago for law school.
Kerpan is conflicted over the new vocabulary test requirement, introduced in 2013. Though it wasnt required 40 years ago, Kerpan said he knew the definitions to most of his words anyway. It helped him to remember them.
I knew the meaning to most of the words. Most of the people did not, Kerpan said.
But today, he admits the words are much harder.
One-third of them, I wouldnt even be able to guess, Kerpan said.

        <MainBody>Baltimore gets bloodier as arrests drop post-Freddie Gray

FILE - In this May 24, 2015, file photo, police pick up a pair of shoes after a double shooting in Baltimore. Residents in West Baltimore say they've been victims of excessive policing in this neighborhood where street crime and drug-dealing have been endemic. Now, one month after riots erupted in the wake of the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, homicides and shootings are up and those same residents feel like they've been abandoned and left to fend for themselves.

BALTIMORE - A 31-year-old woman and a young boy were shot in the head Thursday, becoming Baltimore's 37th and 38th homicide victims so far this month, the city's deadliest in 15 years.
Meanwhile, arrests have plunged: Police are booking fewer than half the number of people they pulled off the streets last year.
Arrests were already declining before Freddie Gray died on April 19 of injuries he suffered in police custody, but they dropped sharply thereafter, as his death unleashed protests, riots, the criminal indictment of six officers and a full-on civil rights investigation by the U.S. Justice Department that has officers working under close scrutiny.
"I'm afraid to go outside," said Antoinette Perrine, whose brother was shot down three weeks ago on a basketball court near her home in the Harlem Park neighborhood of West Baltimore. Ever since, she has barricaded her door and added metal slabs inside her windows to deflect gunfire.
"It's so bad, people are afraid to let their kids outside," Perrine said. "People wake up with shots through their windows. Police used to sit on every corner, on the top of the block. These days? They're nowhere."
West Baltimore residents worry they've been abandoned by the officers they once accused of harassing them, leaving some neighborhoods like the Wild West without a lawman around.
"Before it was over-policing. Now there's no police," said Donnail "Dreads" Lee, 34, who lives in the Gilmor Homes, the public housing complex where Gray, 25, was chased down. "People feel as though they can do things and get away with it. I see people walking with guns almost every single day, because they know the police aren't pulling them up like they used to."
Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said his officers "are not holding back," despite encountering dangerous hostility in the Western District.
"Our officers tell me that when officers pull up, they have 30 to 50 people surrounding them at any time," Batts said.
Batts provided more details at a City Council meeting Wednesday night, saying officers now fear getting arrested for making mistakes.
"What is happening, there is a lot of levels of confusion in the police organization. There are people who have pain, there are people who are hurt, there are people who are frustrated, there are people who are angry," Batts said. "There are people, and they've said this to me, 'If I get out of my car and make a stop for a reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause but I make a mistake on it, will I be arrested?' They pull up to a scene and another officer has done something that they don't know, it may be illegal, will they be arrested for it? Those are things they are asking."
Protesters said Gray's death is emblematic of a pattern of police violence and brutality against impoverished African-Americans in Baltimore. In October, Batts and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake invited the Justice Department to participate in a collaborative review of police policies. The fallout from Gray's death prompted the mayor to ramp that up, and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch agreed to a more intensive probe into whether the department employs discriminatory policing, excessive force and unconstitutional searches and arrests.
Baltimore was seeing a slight rise in homicides this year even before Gray's death April 19. But the 38 homicides so far in May is a major spike, after 22 in April, 15 in March, 13 in February and 23 in January.
With one weekend still to go, May 2015 is already the deadliest month in 15 years, surpassing the November 1999 total of 36.
Ten of May's homicides happened in the Western District, which has had as many homicides in the first five months of this year as it did all of last year.
Non-fatal shootings are spiking as well  91 so far in May, 58 of them in the Western District.
The mayor said her office is "examining" the relationship between the homicide spike and the dwindling arrest rate.
Even before Gray's death, police were making between 25 and 28 percent fewer arrests each month than they made in the same month last year. But so far in May, arrests are down roughly 56 percent. Police booked just 1,045 people in the first 19 days of May, an average of 55 a day. In the same time period last year, police arrested 2,396 people, an average of 126 a day.
In fact, police did not make any arrests in the triple digits between April 22 and May 19, except on two occasions: On April 27, when protests gave way to rioting, police arrested 246 people. On May 2, the last day of a city-wide curfew, police booked 140 people.
At a news conference Wednesday, Rawlings-Blake said there are "a lot of reasons why we're having a surge in violence."
"Other cities that have experienced police officers accused or indicted of crimes, there's a lot of distrust and a community breakdown," Rawlings-Blake said. "The result is routinely increased violence."
"It's clear that the relationship between the commissioner and the rank-and-file is strained," she added. "He's working very hard to repair that relationship."
Emergency response specialist Michael Greenberger cautions against directly blaming police. The founder and director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security, the spike in homicides is more likely a response to Gray's death and the rioting.
"We went through a period of such intense anger that the murder rate got out of control. I think it's been really hard for the police to keep on top of that," he said.
Lee disagrees. He says rival gang members are taking advantage of the police reticence to settle old scores.
"There was a shooting down the street, and the man was standing in the middle of the street with a gun, just shooting," Lee added. "Usually, you can't walk up and down the street drinking or smoking weed. Now, people are everywhere smoking weed, and police just ride by, look at you, and keep going. There used to be police on every corner. I don't think they'll be back this summer."
Batts acknowledged that "the service we're giving is off-target with the community as a whole" and he promised to pay special attention to the Western District.
Veronica Edmonds, a 26-year-old mother of seven in the Gilmor Homes, said she wishes the police would return, and focus on violent crime rather than minor drug offenses.
"If they focused more on criminals and left the petty stuff alone, the community would have more respect for police officers," she said.
