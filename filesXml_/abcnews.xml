United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon believes further investigation is necessary to uncover the truth behind a 1961 plane crash in which Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold and 15 others died.
Questions remain about a possible aerial attack or other interference, Ban said.
But Ban said in a letter to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Monday that an independent review of new information about the mysterious crash put to rest claims that Hammarskjold was assassinated after surviving the crash.

Ban called for countries to disclose relevant records related to the crash.
Hammarskjold's plane, a DC-6 known as the Albertina, crashed Sept. 18, 1961, in the African bush in Northern Rhodesia , today's Zambia , during a peace mission to newly independent Congo .

The crash has long been shrouded in mystery. The lone survivor reported that there were explosions aboard the plane before it hit the ground, and speculation has raged that the plane was shot down, or that Hammarskjold was the subject of an assassination plot.
Pilot error has also been thought to have ontributed to the accident.
Hammarskjold devoted his life to diplomacy and public service. He was born in 1905, the son of Swedish prime minister Hjalmar Hammarskjold, who pushed for neutrality during World War I .
After attending college and receiving a doctorate from Stockholm University, Hammarskjold served as a professor and held various government roles. He joined the United Nations in 1949, and was approved as secretary-general in 1953.

His tenure was marked by his diplomatic entreaties: face-to-face communication between various heads of state, pursuing peace, seeking accord.
He probably knows more state secrets than any man alive, Parade wrote of Hammarskjold in a 1960 profile. He hides what he knows behind a cloud of diplomatic double-talk. Like a baseball umpire, he is aloof, almost icy, and does not fraternize with the players. Also, he is criticized by both sides, and respected for his integrity.
After his death, Hammarskjold was awarded a posthumous Nobel Prize , one of three people to earn the distinction. A foundation was also established in his name, and his journal was published as Markings, a collection of insights and spiritual reflections.

Education activist Malala Yousafzai is calling on world leaders to invest in books, not bullets.
Speaking at the Oslo Education Summit in Oslo, Norway , the 17-year-old Nobel Laureate declared that every child deserves access to 12 years of free education. The poorest girls get just three years of schooling because of a lack of will and vision by our governments, Malala said ahead of her Tuesday speech. This is unacceptable.
In a paper published by the Malala Fund called Beyond Basics, Malala calls on low- and middle-income countries to commit a minimum of 20 percent of their national budgets to education, compared to the current average of 15 percent. A new report published by the UNESCO and Education for All shows that the number of out of school children and young adolescents between the ages of 6 and 15 years is on the rise  up to 124 million in 2013, compared to 122 million in 2011.

Brutal Attacks on Schoolgirls on the Rise, UN Says
Leaders of the 21st century must deliver on their promises to invest in the future and start investing in books, education and hope, rather than in weapons, war and conflicts, Malala said. We will not stop. We will continue to speak out and raise our voices until we see every child in school.
During the World Education Forum in May, 100 countries committed to providing free primary and secondary education to all children by 2030. According to the UNESCO report, the cost of providing 12 years of free education to every child is an estimated $340 billion per year through 2030  or $39 billion more than current commitments. But Malala says that shortfall is a pittance compared to global military spending .
The shocking truth is that world leaders have the money to fully fund global education - but they are choosing to spend it on other things, like their military budgets, Malala wrote in a post on the Malala Fund blog . In fact, if the whole world stopped spending money on the military for just 8 days, we could have the $39 billion needed to provide 12 years of free, quality education to every child on the planet.
When not speaking to world leaders and advocating for education, Malala is making plans for her 18th birthday on July 12. Instead of presents, she is asking supporters to send a message to world leaders: "Post a photo of yourself holding up your favorite book and share why you choose #BooksNotBullets," she wrote. "Tell world leaders to fund the real weapon for change, education!"

Aziz was prolific in ISISs social media outreach, allegedly luring recruits and inspiring attacks on the West online from a number of Twitter accounts.
America likes hitting people, said a Twitter account attributed to Aziz recently, but doesnt like getting hit back Oh well, every action has a reaction.
Lorenzo Vidino, Director of the Program on Extremism at the George Washington University Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, said that if Azizs death is confirmed, it would be a victory for the anti-ISIS coalition .
Obviously he is a person, definitely of interest to authorities because of the influence that he has online and the fact that he has been in contact with people in the West ready to carry out attacks, Vidino said. He was one of the key people inciting attacks in the West, calling people in the West through social media to carry out attacks.
Late today President Obama announced the U.S. is taking off the gloves when it comes to hitting ISIS targets in Syria.
Were going after ISIL [ISIS] leadership and infrastructure in Syria, the heart of [ISIS] that pumps funds and propaganda to people around the world, he said.
The President cited the attack on a Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas in May as the sort of threat the U.S. now faces. The men behind that attack were inspired by Aziz, among others.
The Telegraph reported Aziz traveled to Syria after he was convicted of stabbing a soccer fan in the eye in London. Vidino said that before he left, Aziz was a known member of the radical scene in the U.K.

As Americans were celebrating the Fourth of July holiday, four Russian long-range bomber aircraft flew close enough to the US shores that they were intercepted by military fighter jets. The first set of two bombers flew near Alaska and just 30 minutes later a separate set flew far off the west coast of California.
According to officials at NORAD the flights stayed within international airspace and at no time did any of the Russian bombers enter or get close to entering sovereign North American boundaries.
Close Encounter Between Russian Fighter Jet and US Spy Plane
The first incident occurred at approximately 10:30 a.m. EDT on July 4, when Alaskan-based NORAD F-22 fighters intercepted and visually identified two Russian TU-95 "Bear" long-range bomber aircraft flying off the coast of the Aleutian Islands within the Air Defense Identification Zone (an area of international waters that stretches 200 miles from US coastline), officials at NORAD said in a statement to ABC News.
Then at approximately 11 a.m. EDT, NORAD F-15 fighters from the Continental NORAD Region intercepted and visually identified two additional Bear bombers flying off the central California coast, well away from U.S. sovereign airspace.
While Northcom is not saying precisely how far out the California intercept occurred, one official said it was on the outer lines of the ADIZ, meaning it could have been as far out as 200 miles. US airspace begins 12 miles from the coasts. The US asks military aircraft from other countries operating in that space to identify themselves and will make sure they've changed course away from US shores before backing away.
While intercepts of Russian aircraft off Alaska occur frequently, intercepts off California are less common. In June last year a two long-range Russian bombers flew within 50 miles of northern California.

A womans sleepwalking turned life-threatening when she walked straight into the sea in the middle of the night.
Marie Lord, 39, has a hotel porter to thank for saving her life after she sleepwalked into the sea in front of the Anchor Head Hotel in Somerset, U.K.
Lee Searle was three hours into his night shift two weeks ago at the seafront hotel when he heard Lord from the sand, he told ABC News today.

"I heard someone cry for help and I went back outside and that's when I found her. My first thought was that this lady needs help and fast," he said.
Searle said Lord was soaking wet and he quickly brought her back to the hotel and wrapped her in blankets.
Lord left her home around 1:30 a.m. and walked a half mile to the beach, maneuvering the streets and even down steep concrete steps, according to Searle.
Im only 4 feet 10 and I have really short legs, so I dont usually go down [the stairs] without my husband or some kind of aid, she told the Telegraph.
The 39-year-old made it over all the obstacles and was woken up once she reached the water and quickly became disoriented, Searle said.
Its absolutely mind-blowing to think about what could have happened, she told the Telegraph. All I remember is seeing a flashing star and it all seemed like a dream.
Lord was transported to Weston General Hospital.
It turns out that she had the onsets of hypothermia. If she was not found, she could have died," Searle said. "It was unreal how quick it all happened."

QUITO, Ecuador  Jul 5, 2015, 7:57 PM ET
Pope Francis waves to the crowd as he rides aboard the Popemobile in the streets of Quito, Ecuador, Sunday, July 5, 2015. Francis is making his first visit as pope to his Spanish-speaking neighborhood.

At the start of a weeklong visit to his native continent, Pope Francis arrived to a red carpet reception at Quito's main airport, where Ecuador's socialist president Rafael Correa greeted him on the tarmac.
But as the pope's motorcade proceeded into the city, many along the sidelines voiced their disapproval of Correa, giving him thumbs down.
For this first Latin American pope, the trip is almost a homecoming. He is not visiting his home country Argentina on this trip. Instead he will travel the Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay.
This is his first visit to Spanish speaking countries here. All three countries he is visiting are overwhelmingly Catholic and among the poorest on the continent.
Pope Brings 'Church for the Poor' to South America's Poorest
At Quito airport, Pope Francis said he feels "particular concern for our brothers and sisters who are most fragile and minorities who are most vulnerable."
The large open air masses he is scheduled to hold during his visit are expected to draw millions of people. The pope also plans to take time to visit a Bolivian prison and a slum in Paraguay, making the effort to connect with those at the margins of society.
Pope Francis took time to meet each of the 75 journalists traveling with him on the papal plane, accepting presents from some reporters and blessing rosaries and other items they brought with them.
One Bolivian reporter gave Francis locally made chocolates with his face on them. The pope beamed as he agreed to take a selfie with her.
But the trip will be physically grueling for the 78-year-old leader of the Catholic faith. He is scheduled to make nine stops in seven days, making this his longest busiest foreign trip yet.
One stop, in Bolivian capital La Paz, is at an altitude of 4,000 meters, equivalent to some of the tallest mountains in the United States.
As a young man, Pope Francis lost part of one lung due to an illness, and church officials acknowledged some concern about altitude sickness.
According to Vatican officials, the pope has expressed an interest in trying a local remedy popular among indigenous people in the Andes mountains: coca leaves.
Local residents chew them or drink them in tea to alleviate the shortness of breath and queeziness that can result from spending even a few short hours at altitude.
But coca leaves are illegal in much of the developed world, banned as a controlled substance because they are the raw ingredient of cocaine.

It is the most excitement Ive ever had with a fish. It was so hard to hold onto the rod. I thought the fish was going to pull me into the water, Kegan told Great River Fishing Adventures.
On his first day out on the water on vacation, Kegans rod dipped into the water and he didnt back down from the ensuing fight.
He, his father and Great River Fishing Adventures guide Ben Trainer spent the next hour and 45 minutes reeling in their catch in a nearly impossible feat," said Matthew Clive, a spokesman for Great River Fishing Adventures.

With the size of this fish, Id bet its over 75 years old, he added.
Kegan, only 4-feet tall and from New Jersey, got the 10-foot long fish near shore, where Trainer examined it and estimated its weight to be 600 pounds.
The sturgeon was then released back into the river.
Before Mondays new personal record, Kegan said he had caught a 120-pound sailfish on vacation in Mexico .
Great River Fishing Adventures has caught and released four monster-sized sturgeons in the past five years, company officials said, noting the largest weighed in at 1,100 pounds.

Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites would be required to report suspected terror messages to law enforcement authorities under a bill approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee, something U.S. and British law enforcement officials told ABC News they do not routinely do now.
The bill, which is headed for consideration before the whole Senate, is being applauded by U.S. counter- terrorism officials but opposed by civil liberties groups.
While Facebook says it works aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, it and other social media sites are not currently required to report suspect messages to law enforcement, as they are in cases involving child pornography.
What they do now is simply terminate the account of the person who is plotting the attack, said Richard Clarke , a former White House counterterrorism official and ABC News consultant. It is very unlikely today that a social media company would turn around and call the police.
London Attack: Man Hacked to Death in Suspected 'Terrorist Incident'
U.S. officials say ISIS and other terror groups regularly use social media sites to communicate with followers and urge them to attack.
ISIS is using social media for their battlefield communications, said former British counter-terror official Michael Clarke, Director General of the Royal United Services Institute.
In the era of social media, a phenomenon like ISIL [ISIS], unlike Al Qaeda of the old days, there doesn't have to be and won't necessarily be a command-and-control relationship between somebody who instigates an incident and ISIL as an organization," U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told reporters today. "They are self-radicalized, self-organized people on social media. Are we concerned about that? Absolutely, we're concerned about it."
Under the proposed Senate legislation (language below), social media sites would have a duty to report any information it learns about terrorist activity.
The issue first emerged two years ago in the wake of the brutal beheading of a British soldier, Lee Rigby, on the streets of London.
Authorities say they later learned that the attackers had communicated about their intentions on a social media site reported to be Facebook.
Lets kill a soldier, was one of the messages, according to a British investigation.
Officials say their accounts were closed but authorities were not notified before the attack.
If they are saying things, like, I want to go out and behead a soldier, then that ought to alert the system, said Hazel Blears a former leading member of the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament who was part of an investigation into the failure of social media to disclose what it knew.
There is certainly, in my view, a moral responsibility, Blears told ABC News.
Facebook did not respond directly to criticism from authorities, but in Rigbys case said that the company was horrified by what happened. A spokesperson said, Facebooks policies are clear  we do not allow terrorists content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes. The spokesperson also pointed to a statement on their Community Standards page, which says, "We work with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety."
A U.S. Senate aide said the proposed Senate bill only requires social media sites to report information they are made aware of and does not require the specific monitoring of any particular user. Facebook previously said that it relies on its users to report misuse of its service.
Still, some civil liberties groups say the legislation creates a dangerous precedent.
In this American democracy, we dont want our social media providers to be acting as essentially secret police, said Nate Cardozo, a Staff Attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. There is a first amendment right to talk about terrorism Discussing controversial political, religious, social events of our time is absolutely protected speech. And requiring social media providers to rat out their customers for engaging in their first amendment right to debate important topics is not something that is constitutional.
Cardozo disagreed that in the Rigby case, law enforcement should have seen the Facebook messages because they didnt represent a true threat.
A spokesperson for Twitter did not respond to requests for comment on this report.
Below is the updated language in the Intelligence Authorization Act related to social networks, as approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee and obtained by ABC News:
SEC. 603. REQUIREMENT TO REPORT TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND THE UNLAWFUL DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION RELATING TO EXPLOSIVES.
(a) DUTY TO REPORT.Whoever, while engaged in providing an electronic communication service or a remote computing service to the public through a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce, obtains actual knowledge of any terrorist activity, including the facts or circumstances described in subsection (c) shall, as soon as reasonably possible, provide to the appropriate authorities the facts or circumstances of the alleged terrorist activities.
(b) ATTORNEY GENERAL DETERMINATION.The Attorney General shall determine the appropriate authorities under subsection (a).
(c) FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES.The facts or circumstances described in this subsection, include any facts or circumstances from which there is an apparent violation of section 842(p) of title 18, United States Code, that involves distribution of information relating to explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction.
(d) PROTECTION OF PRIVACY.Nothing in this section may be construed to require an electronic communication service provider or a remote computing service provider (1) to monitor any user, subscriber, or customer of that provider; or (2) to monitor the content of any communication of any person described in paragraph (1).

        <MainBody>Mali Extremist Traded for French Hostage Killed in Attack
BAMAKO, Mali  Jul 6, 2015, 3:37 PM ET
A Malian special forces spokesman says an Islamic extremist who was released last year in exchange for the freedom of a French hostage in Mali has been killed.
Modibo Nama Traore said Monday that French special forces killed Mohamed Ali Ag Wadossene in an early Sunday morning operation in the Tigharghar mountains in north Mali's Kidal region. A dozen others were arrested, he said.
An official with the French special forces, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak to the press, confirmed the operation.
Ag Wadossene was among the al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb members who kidnapped Philippe Verdon and Serge Lazarevic in northern Mali in 2011. Ag Wadossene was captured, and then released in December 2014 for the freedom of French hostage Lazarevic.

        <MainBody>Correction: Palestinians-Rainbow Flag Story
RAMALLAH, West Bank  Jul 6, 2015, 3:25 PM ET
In a story June 30 about Palestinian protesters whitewashing a gay pride rainbow flag, The Associated Press reported erroneously that homosexual acts are banned by law in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. While homosexuality is largely taboo in Palestinian society, there are no laws specifically banning homosexual acts.
A corrected version of the story is below:
Angry protesters whitewash rainbow flag on West Bank barrier
Angry protesters whitewash Palestinian artist's painting of rainbow flag on West Bank barrier
By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH
Associated Press
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP)  Palestinian protesters whitewashed a rainbow flag of gay rights that was painted by a Palestinian artist on six slabs of the West Bank separation barrier.
The artist, Khaled Jarrar, said Tuesday his art was meant as a reminder that Palestinians live under Israeli occupation, at a time when gay rights are in the news after the U.S. allowed same-sex weddings.
But protesters perceived the painting as support for homosexuality, a taboo subject in Palestinian society, where gays are not tolerated.
The artwork ignited angry responses among Palestinians, and activists whitewashed the flag on Monday night, just a few hours after it was painted on the best known section of Israel's graffiti-covered barrier, next to a portrait of Yasser Arafat and other Palestinian leaders.
Jarrar, 39, who has exhibited in Europe and the United States, told The Associated Press that the destruction "reflects the absence of tolerance, and freedoms in the Palestinian society."
"People don't accept different thinking in our society," he said, adding he drew the rainbow flag on the barrier to put a spotlight on Palestinian issues.
Mohammed, who only gave his first name for fear of repercussions, said he helped whitewash the flag because "we cannot promote gay rights."
Mohammed al-Amleh, a 46-year-old lawyer, also approved of the action, saying that "it would be shameful to have the flag of gays in our refugee camp."
Gay Palestinians tend to be secretive about their social lives and some have crossed into Israel to live safely.
There are no laws on the books in either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip that specifically ban homosexual acts.
Israel, meanwhile, has emerged as one of the world's most gay-friendly travel destinations recently, in sharp contrast to most of the rest of the Middle East , where gay culture is not tolerated and gays are persecuted and even killed. Earlier this month, over 100,000 people attended a gay pride parade in Tel Aviv.
In Israel, gays serve openly in Israel's military and parliament, and many popular artists and entertainers are gay.
Gays cannot marry in Israel, primarily because there is no civil marriage of any kind  all Jewish weddings must be conducted through the Jewish rabbinate, which considers homosexuality a sin and a violation of Jewish law. But the state recognizes same-sex couples who marry abroad.
Across most of the rest of the Middle East, however, gay and lesbian relationships are taboo. The pervasiveness of religion in everyday life, along with strict cultural norms, plays a major factor in that.
Same-sex relations are punishable by death in Iran, Mauritania, Saudi Arabia , Sudan and Yemen.

Associated Press writer Ian Deitch contributed to this report from Jerusalem.

People gather at the site of suicide bomb attack at Redeem Christian church in Potiskum, Nigeria, Sunday, July 5, 2015. Witnesses say a woman suicide bomber blew up in the midst of a crowded evangelical Christian church service on Sunday and killed at least five people, the latest in a string of bombings and shooting attacks blamed on the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram that has killed some 200 people in the past week.

A day of extremist violence against both Muslims and Christians in Nigeria killed more than 60 people, including worshippers in a mosque who came to hear a cleric known for preaching peaceful coexistence of all faiths.
Militants from Boko Haram were blamed for the bombings Sunday night at a crowded mosque and a posh Muslim restaurant in the central city of Jos; a suicide bombing earlier at an evangelical Christian church in the northeastern city of Potiskum, and attacks in several northeastern villages where dozens of churches and about 300 homes were torched.
President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attacks and said the government will defend Nigerians' right to worship freely.
It was the latest spasm of violence by Boko Haram extremists who have killed about 300 people in the past week  apparently after an order by the self-proclaimed Islamic State group for more mayhem during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Earlier this year, Boko Haram became an affiliate of the Islamic State group.
The deadliest attack came on Wednesday when more than 140 people were killed  mostly men and boys mowed down by gunfire as they prayed in mosques in the northeastern town of Kukawa.
Burials were held Monday for 51 people killed by the two bombings a day earlier in Jos, said Muslim community lawyer Ahmed Garba.
Another 67 people were wounded, according to Abdussalam Mohammed, the National Emergency Management Agency coordinator.
The explosion at the Yantaya Mosque came as cleric Sani Yahaya was addressing the worshippers, survivors said. Yahaya is the national chairman of the Jama'atu Izalatul Bidia organization, which preaches that all religions should peacefully coexist.
Garba said gunmen also opened fire on the mosque from three directions.
Survivor Danladi Sani said he saw a man dressed in white take aim at Yahaya, and then blow himself up. Yahaya was unharmed, Sani added.
"He is a great Islamic scholar who has spoken out against Boko Haram, and that is why we believe he was the target," Sani told The Associated Press.
Another bomb exploded at Shagalinku, a restaurant often patronized by state governors and other top politicians for its specialties popular with Muslims, witnesses said.
Sabi'u Bako was picking up a takeout meal when he heard a massive explosion as he walked away with friends.
"The restaurant was destroyed, and we saw many people covered in blood," he said. "We can't believe that we escaped."
Jos is a hotspot for violent religious confrontations because it is located in the center of the country where Nigeria's majority Muslim north meets the mainly Christian south. The city has been targeted by bombs claimed by Boko Haram extremists that have killed hundreds.
Earlier Sunday, a female suicide bomber struck a crowded service of the Redeemed Christian Church of God in Potiskum, killing six people, witnesses said.
Elsewhere in the northeast, extremists killed nine people and burned down 32 churches and about 300 homes in several villages, said Stephen Apagu, chairman of a self-defense group in Borno state's Askira-Uba local government area. He said the militia killed three militants.
The villages had been attacked three days earlier and 29 people killed.
The United States condemned the recent attacks and said it continues to provide counterterrorism assistance to Nigeria to "combat the threat posed by Boko Haram," said a statement Monday from State Department spokesman John Kirby.
Boko Haram took over a large swath of northeastern Nigeria last year. A multinational force from Nigeria and its neighbors forced the militants out of many towns, but bombings and village attacks have increased in recent weeks.
Meanwhile, Nigeria's military freed 180 detainees who had been held for up to two years, accused of being Boko Haram members. Those freed Monday included women with babies and toddlers.

Faul reported from Lagos, Nigeria. Associated Press writer Haruna Umar in Maiduguri, Nigeria, contributed to this report.

This version has been corrected to show that only the mosque bombing in Jos was a suicide attack.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia  Jul 6, 2015, 2:53 PM ET
More than 200 forest fires are burning across western Canada , causing a heavy gray haze to settle over the Pacific coast and forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents.
Authorities issued air quality advisories across British Columbia on Monday as an unrelenting heat wave that began in early June sent temperatures soaring to record highs. More than 20 fires were sparked on Sunday alone, according to officials.
People with medical conditions, as well as the elderly and the very young were urged to remain indoors and limit strenuous activity.
A 61-year-old logger died Sunday while helping forestry crews battle a wildfire near Sechelt, north of Vancouver.
Local authorities have imposed a province-wide ban on open burning.

        <MainBody>The Latest: Flags From Many Nations Seen During Pope Visit
QUITO, Ecuador  Jul 6, 2015, 2:50 PM ET
By The Associated Press
Here are the latest developments from Pope Francis' trip to South America:

1:30 p.m.
Flags of more than half a dozen countries can be seen waving in the air at a Mass that Pope Francis is celebrating in Guayaquil, a humid port city that is Ecuador's largest.
The variety of flags include: Ecuador, Mexico, Peru , the United States, Argentina , Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Puerto Rico.
"I didn't want to miss the opportunity to see Francis," said Norma Peralta, from neighboring Peru. "It took me about 10 hours driving to get here. It's cheaper than going to the Vatican."

1:05 p.m.
Pope Francis is focusing his homily on the family while celebrating Mass at a large park in Ecuador's coastal city of Guayaquil.
Francis gave the example of a mother and her children, saying she loves all of them equally.
"The family is also a small church, a domestic church," said Francis. "With life, it channels tenderness and divine mercy."
Hundreds of thousands listened to the pope at Semanes Park while standing in the hot sun and using handkerchiefs to wipe sweat from their brows.

12:06 p.m.
Hundreds of thousands of faithful cheered Pope Francis as he arrived at the Semanes Park in Guayaquil. The pope planned to celebrate Mass at the park in the Ecuadorean coastal city, the country's largest with 2.35 million residents.
Riding in the popemobile, Francis waved to the crowds. People waved handkerchiefs and Vatican flags.
The port city is known for its heat and humidity, at noon was already 86 degree Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).

11:05 a.m.
Pope Francis has arrived at the Divine Mercy shrine in the Ecuadorean coastal city of Guayaquil. Upon arrival to the shrine, the outstretched hand of a young child nearly poked Francis in the eye. The pope smiled as he continued walking.
Francis then spent a minute praying at the shrine beneath a large painting of Jesus. The pope told the crowd he would pray for them.
"And I won't charge you a thing," he joked. "All I ask is that you pray for me. Will you promise me that?"
After visiting the shrine, the pope plans to celebrate Mass at a park with more than 1 million people.

10:43 a.m.
A self-proclaimed "Mr. Nobody" soon will be sharing the spotlight with one of the world's most famous people.
It's been 30 years since the Rev. Francisco Cortes last spoke with Pope Francis, who at that time was the Rev. Jorge Mario Bergoglio.
Cortes, known as Padre Paquito, must have made quite an impression on Bergoglio, who in Argentina was in charge of the Jesuit order that the men share.
Cortes, who is 91 years old and a Spaniard by birth, was to spend five minutes with the pope on Monday. They will meet in a small room adorned by flowers and religious paintings after Francis celebrates an outdoor Mass in the Ecuadorean coastal city of Guayaquil.
"I don't know why he set the meeting. We haven't even corresponded," Cortes told The Associated Press in an interview. "I'm really just a Mr. Nobody."

10:03 a.m.
A handful of altar boys took selfie photos with Pope Francis upon his arrival in Guayaquil, a port city in Ecuador where the pope plans to celebrate Mass with up to 1 million people. The altar boys were waiting on the tarmac and approached the pontiff when he descended from his plane.

Transcript for Int'l Hotspot: Dozens of Egyptian Soldiers Killed by ISIS Suicide Bombers
New terror miles from the Gaza border ice is launching multiple attacks on military targets in Egypt. At least sixty soldiers killed by suicide bombers at checkpoints threw out the Sinai Peninsula the terror group now warning of deadly attack surrounding the Muslim holiday. Robert now. Right now international hot spot Egypt. Pac man is in New York this afternoon the White House National Security Council releasing a statement in support of Egypt following these attacks saying in part. The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attacks against Egyptian security forces. In north Sinai this morning which killed dozens of Egyptian person Allen injured many others the United States stands resolutely with Egypt a bit the spate of terrorist attacks. Have afflicted the country. Following this story for a ABC's Alex mark pot in Beirut Alex. Hello to you and dozens of soldiers killed in multiple attacks what do we know about how these attacks were carried out. That's right time fact that fighting is still ongoing it's been raging all day right in the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula against the border. Gaza and Israel as you mentioned the latest reports that we're getting are around sixty to seventy soldiers dead. Scores more militant as scores more of militants dead on top of that these numbers have not yet been confirms. By the Egyptian army but these are reports that are sourcing. A medical sources bear in the Sinai Peninsula that's fighting started around 6 o'clock in the morning. When these militants attacked the town of chickens who waited. And this was. I'm. This it's this attack was quickly claimed by a group called Sinai Peninsula which it is an affiliate of ices in the Sinai Peninsula you speak I'll answer atomic decent solely swore allegiance. Two ice is back in November and this is one of the deadliest it's not the deadliest terrorist attack in modern engines and history. And it comes just two days after Egypt's top prosecuted at public prosecutor. Was assassinated in his upscale neighborhood. In Cairo has been not there hasn't been any claim responsibility yet. Sport that attacked the assumption is it was also carried out by miss about Egypt is buried our turn. Do we know what ideas might have focused on the Sinai Peninsula. Well this is the place bets militants have been Terry audit tax years more than 700. Egyptian security forces have been killed by Islamist militants. Among them from this group Sinai Peninsula. In the past two years there are a lot of military targets there. In the Sinai and there has been a fierce crackdown by the government. Of president's SEC against these islamists after he came to power he took power seized power is safe. In Millard military tools from the is Liz is Louis president Mohamed Morse. It had warned of deadly attacks particular are wrapped particularly around Ramadan with Egypt prepared for an attack like this. You are right this is the holy month of Ramadan and and prices both for and had calls for expanded attacks in the region around the world's. And we've seen a couple of these. Attacks take place over the past few days in places like seizure were almost forty. People were killed on that beach at a mosque in Kuwait. Where a suicide bomber went in and and and blue glow didn't look at suicide vest at the height of Friday prayers. Com now it's it's part is it's hard to call these all. Ice is attacks we don't notes what extent ice is proper in Iraq Syria. Has. Has ordered these attacks as sanction them. But it goes to show that the reach of crisis is expanding and that people are willing to take matters into their own ante up lone gunman. You have groups that are acting by themselves and then ices as a whole claims that attack. This is the second attack of the week in Egypt who was targeted and Monday's bombing. Now is the public prosecutor. Name of guy named Eric disembarked. That was one of the highest level political assassinations. In decades. And she was someone who had helps the CC regime clamp down. On the islamists since easy came to power exactly two years ago and that's what we should actually note is that. Years ago right now there are these mass protests and Kyra that ended on July 3 when the military men and chicks. Morse the out. And since then. Hundreds of Islam isn't being chilled and rounded up arrested put on trial sentenced to death. By the CC regime and its judiciary. And so that's. One and that's the main reason that we're seeing this massive backlash all these attacks by as well as. Alex this attack also following three others last week in France Kuwait and two knees you what is the sense now on the ground in terms. Fear and and what may be next. Well the senses. That this is something that's just going to continue I mean crisis is we know it's you know it got its name because it's in Iraq and Syria but frankly it's it's spreading. Like cancer throughout the regional affiliates are up in in Libya and Egypt all across our North Africa and beyond and so this is something. Better that will continue. An and answers certainly could grow. Because it's Ramadan and we could see more attacks decree on Friday you know witches witches believe that it. The May Day and increase our calendar. And and so we expect more these attacks I mean this is something. That has picked up in case something has been picked up and scale it's it's it's up in terms of the geography. And anger Saudi Arabia for example which is the place we rarely see any sort of attacks in the past few weeks there have been two attacks. By ice militants it again it's Shiite mosques and this is something to it that they'll just. And Alex is there a sense of outrage among some Muslims that these attacks are happening during this holiest times. Absolutely. This was expected but there certainly is outraged at the same time this is something that this region has come to grout is is is grappling and and world regardless of whether or not it's Ramadan. This is something that you know people all across regional firm. You're Lebanon's it to Syrian and ends Egypt are trying to figure out. Out to deal but in the meantime. This is a group and that it is only growing in terms of it its ability to carry edit and willingness to carry out attacks. As we know now with some of the bodies are being flown back up particularly apt from Tunisia to the United Kingdom in terms of victims of that attack. What are some of they reactions that you have been seeing. On the ground there in the Middle East to these most recent spate of attacks. All apps that outraged and I think we should just someone in Egypt for example this is no Tunisia is often held up as an example. Or is often called the only success story and the Arab Spring gave managed to do. Transitioned to a democratic governments and I was actually in Tunisia two months ago are right at three months ago. When there is the attack on the national museum. And there is this sense of outrage there that something like this would disrupt the relative peace that they've had that you know that they're on the right track. And you can see it in those scenes from Tunisia on the beach. They were all these other Sunnis and shouting at the gunman creating this human chain to block him from carrying out more tax there is a great story a construction worker on the roof growing tiles at. At the young at the gunman so there certainly is a sense of outraged. By everyday Muslims all across the Middle East in Tunisia and beyond. I'm Alex thank you so much for joining us ABC's mark pot in Beirut. Also joining us now ABC news counterterrorism contributor John Cohen John reports cities attacks were well coordinated and happened. Simultaneously. What does that say about ice this strategy is this something we've seen out high they use in the past. It good afternoon in time. Top crisis is trying to project a global presence and they're doing it through various strategies. One they're trying to pull territories Syria and Iraq. They're gaining territory humans through insurgent army techniques they're trying to govern its territories the building affiliations with. Other extremist organizations and countries like Saudi Arabia. Tunisia Libya. Kuwait in each out and date through these affiliations are trying to show people that they can cost problems in these countries as well. Process seeking to inspire. People around the world particularly in Europe and unites states and Canada to act independently carry out attacks on their behalf. They you all of this together in a coordinated synchronized way because they are trying to show that they are global organization with global reach. And last week's attack in France Kuwait and Tunisia now Egypt are certainly evidence that in part. That is in fact coming true how our US counterterrorism officials working to prevent a possible life is attacked here in the United States especially leading up to this holiday weekend. Well this is an area big concern for US law enforcement. You've seen the FBI much more aggressive of late and looking at people who they believe may be inspired by the axis ideology and taking law enforcement action against those people you see quite a bit of intelligence being shared the private sector state and local law enforcement. And ask state local law enforcement looks to provide security around these fourth of July events. You'll see stepped up efforts to in screening of people coming to these events and undercover. Officers being in it in with the crowd. And critical infrastructure protection activities around key targets. The area concerned there's a lot of security in place. It's already in place a tremendous increase as V don't into the weekend. Com and I would remind you that crisis has specifically I. Asked this thing out for attacks. I during the month Ramadan. Arbitrary and as you talk about her hair and there's real concern that somebody on their independently low heat that and action in the United States. I need these news contributor John Colin thank you for being with us. And you can keep up with this story in real time I downloading the ABC news app and starring this story for exclusive updates on the go.
